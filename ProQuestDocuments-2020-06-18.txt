Baldwin's Wash releasing 1st album since 2013

Full text: Singer Martha Wash, of Baldwin, whose vocals on "It's Raining Men" and "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" made her a dance-music star, is releasing her first full-length solo album since 2013's "Something Good."
"Love and Conflict," due out Jan. 6 on her own Purple Rose label and not yet available for preorder, dropped its first single, "Never Enough Money," on SoundCloud in late November. In the anthem against greed and avarice, she belts out, "You think you're trending now / And everybody's going 'Wow!' / If all you want is more / Then I'll show you the door/ You tweet and troll us all - can't you be sweet / There's never enough money in the world for you."
"My producers took me out of my comfort zone and into a new musical direction and the results are both uplifting and thought-provoking," Wash, 65, told Rolling Stone, which called the song "a stomping, rough-around-the-edges blues rocker anchored by a righteous vocal performance." "I think that everyone will relate to the lyrics on this album and each listener will get their own message from the music," the Grammy Award nominee added.
In October, the San Francisco-born Wash said on the Ultimate Disco Cruise website that she was then finishing the album, which she described as "a gumbo of music because it's a little rock, a little pop, it's a little '60s kind of psychedelic. I never wanted to be pigeonholed into one genre of music ... I just like different kinds of music because that's what I grew up on."
Wash began her career as a backup singer for disco star Sylvester in the 1970s, then broke out with the late Izora Armstead in the duo The Weather Girls. Their 1982 hit "It's Raining Men" became a club staple, and later the signature song of Channing Tatum's male-stripper troupe in his movie "Magic Mike" (2012). When her standout vocals on songs including C+C Music Factory's "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" went uncredited, Wash became an artists' advocate who helped to spearhead a federal law mandating proper music credit.

BALDWIN MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN CRASH THAT KILLED RETIRED PRIEST

Full text: A Baldwin man has pleaded guilty to manslaughter seven months after police said he was driving a car while high on alprazolam and fentanyl and caused a crash that killed a 69-year-old retired priest, authorities said.
Christopher Gomez-Almendarez, 24, entered the plea Friday before Nassau County Court Judge Patricia Harrington to charges of second-degree manslaughter, second-degree assault, and driving while ability impaired by a combination of drugs, according to a news release issued by Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas.
On Jan. 24, Gomez-Almendarez is expected to be sentenced to six years in prison on the assault charge, concurrent to 2½ years to seven years on the manslaughter charge and 364 days on the driving while ability impaired charge for the April 19 crash that killed the Rev. T. Chacko Mammen of North Bellmore.
"Reverend Mammen was a father of five children and a cherished community and church leader when his life was tragically cut short by this defendant," Singas said in the release. "The combination of the defendant's speed and his drug impairment was lethal to anyone in his path. Our condolences remain with his family, friends and parishioners."
Gomez-Almendarez's attorney, Brian J. Griffin of Garden City, declined to comment.
At the time of the crash, State Police said Mammen was driving west at about 12:10 a.m. on the Southern State Parkway in his GMC sport utility vehicle near Exit 30 in North Massapequa - hours after giving a Good Friday sermon - when Gomez-Almendarez's car struck the SUV from behind, forcing it onto the shoulder, where it struck a tree.
Investigators said Gomez-Almendarez was driving 86 to 91 miles per hour in the seconds before the crash, and that the vehicle did not slow up or brake before impact.
Mammen, a popular priest at Long Island Mar Thoma Church in Merrick, was pronounced dead at a hospital.
His wife, Wilsy Mammen, 65, was treated for pain and bruising, authorities sai

Big-time ribbing at Baldwin 'Comedy Central Roast'

Author: Lovece, Frank

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 Sep 2019: 14.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Meme-like milestones from a Long Island-born actor's life became the stuff of jokes Sunday night on the "Comedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin."
Stand-up comic Jeff Ross, who turned 54 on Friday, set the tone of the proceedings with a jibe about Baldwin's Emmy Award-winning impression of President Donald Trump on "Saturday Night Live." "What a lot of people don't realize," he said, "is that for the last three years, Donald Trump is actually doing an Alec Baldwin impression: He calls people names, he yells at the press, he married an immigrant half his age."
Baldwin, 61, who was born in Amityville and raised in Massapequa, has had numerous high-profile run-ins with paparazzi. He is married to the Mallorca, Spain-born and Boston-raised Hilaria Thomas Baldwin, who is in her mid-30s.
Ross also took aim at Baldwin's widely publicized voicemail message to his eldest child, model Ireland Baldwin, whose mother is his ex-wife, Oscar-winner Kim Basinger. In April 2007, after saying he has become frustrated with then 11-year-old Ireland "constantly" not coming to the phone for the divorced father's scheduled phone call, Alec Baldwin loses his temper and says of her, among other things, "What a rude little pig you really are. You are a rude, thoughtless little pig." He also initially refers to her as being 12 years old before quickly correcting himself and saying 11.
"The only difference" between Alec Baldwin and Trump, Ross says, "is that Trump calls his daughter a fox, not a pig. Here's to you, Ireland!" Ross says, to the audience's amusement. "Great job, Ireland - you didn't oink once!" The camera then cuts to her in the audience, laughing uproariously.
Ireland Baldwin, 23, herself took the dais at the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California, on Sept. 7, when the special was shot. She begins by feigning that her father has never met her: "Hi, Dad," she says. "I'm Ireland." She goes on to say she almost did not know about the roast, "because I haven't checked my voicemails from my dad from the last, like, 12 years?"
Then keying in on the misstated age, she added, "I actually have a lot in common with the people on this roast because like them, I don't really know you that well, either. Well," she continues, "a lot of people know my dad as that guy from the 'Mission: Impossible' movies or that guy from '30 Rock.' I know him as that guy from, like, half of my birthday parties?"
After a beat, Alec Baldwin cracks up at that final line, to Ireland's delight.
Also at the roast, the 17th in a series of mostly annual specials that began in 2003, were actor Robert De Niro, TV stars Joel McHale and Debra Messing, "SNL" cast member Chris Redd, NBA player Blake Griffin and reality-TV star and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, as well as Messing's "Will & Grace" co-star Sean Hayes as host.

A chance for Baldwin to become its best self

Full text: For too long, downtown Baldwin has been home to vacant stores, some rundown buildings, and streets that are too busy to allow for a thriving walkable and livable community. For decades, Hempstead Town officials, developers, civic groups and business leaders have put forth visions and plans for Baldwin, without success.
Now, Baldwin has a new opportunity - on a $10 million platter. As the latest winner of a state downtown revitalization grant, Baldwin will have money to develop projects the community wants to fund, and to bring in expertise to help carry out its ideas. 
That effort will dovetail with the town's ongoing effort to rezone the area to open the door for new apartments, office space and retail near the Baldwin train station. Hempstead officials expect to vote on the new zone this fall.
Residents are on board. And developing Baldwin is one of the few issues that finds agreement in the otherwise-fractured Hempstead government, with its Democratic supervisor and Republican-dominated town board. Bipartisanship will be critical to Baldwin's success.
It will behoove Baldwin to study what other Long Island communities are doing with their revitalization grants, and how they've managed the state's sometimes-complicated process. Westbury's ambitious rezoning plans and Central Islip's streetscaping and new multiuse development proposals can serve as models for what's possible in Baldwin.
It's time for visions to become reality. - The editorial board

De Niro, more to roast Baldwin on Comedy Central

Full text: Actor Robert De Niro, TV stars Joel McHale and Debra Messing, comedians Chris Redd and Jeff Ross, NBA player Blake Griffin and reality-TV star and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner will be among the talent taking jabs at Alec Baldwin at his upcoming Comedy Central Roast.
The cable network announced the lineup Monday. This 17th roast in a series of mostly annual specials that began in 2003 will shoot at the Saban Theatre in Los Angeles on Sept. 7 and premiere on Comedy Central on Sept. 15 at 10 p.m. Messing's "Will & Grace" costar Sean Hayes was previously announced as roastmaster.
Additional roasters will be announced, the network said.
"When I taped this promo I had no idea who would be on the dais of my Comedy Central roast," three-time Emmy Award-winner Baldwin, 61, who was born Amityville and raised in Massapequa, said in a comedic trailer for the show. "That's why I recorded these generic reactions here. Cue somebody's name," he instructs an off-camera person.
As the names and photos of Hayes and the seven announced roasters appear, Baldwin offers purportedly blind comedic counterpoint.
When the network announced the special on June 5, Baldwin said in a statement, "Getting roasted will be the greatest honor of my lifetime besides being a father, a husband, hosting 'SNL' seventeen times, receiving Golden Globes [and] Emmys, and working with Martin Scorsese."
He later wrote on social media, "I've earned this." He added shortly afterward, "This seemed like a good idea when I agreed to it," to which Comedy Central commented, "It wasn't a good idea. It was a great idea."

Full text: Alec Baldwin has been tapped to be the next honoree at a Comedy Central Roast.
The cable network announced Wednesday that the film, TV and theater star would be the 17th celebrity to be jokingly insulted by comedians and other performers in its series of mostly annual specials that began in 2003. 
"Getting roasted will be the greatest honor of my lifetime besides being a father, a husband, hosting 'SNL' seventeen times, receiving Golden Globes Emmys, and working with Martin Scorsese," Baldwin, 61, said in a statement.
He later wrote on social media, "I've earned this." In an Instagram post some minutes later, he added, "This seemed like a good idea when I agreed to it," to which Comedy Central commented, "It wasn't a good idea. It was a great idea."
No other guests were named. The network said the special will shoot in New York with the airdate to be announced, and later tweeted "#BaldwinRoast this summer." 
Recent roastees include Bruce Willis, Rob Lowe, Justin Bieber and James Franco.
Baldwin - who was awarded two Emmys for "30 Rock" and one for "Saturday Night Live," as well as an Obie Award for Off-Broadway's "Prelude to a Kiss" - plays the titular automaker in re-enactment segments of the documentary "Framing John DeLorean," which is opening on Friday and playing in New York City at the IFC Center.

Baldwin to star as iconic automaker DeLorean

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A new trailer for the film "Framing John DeLorean" offers several glimpses of Alec Baldwin in the title role. The movie will hold its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in April.
The film appears to be a hybrid of documentary and dramatization, in which Baldwin, sporting gray hair and darkened eyebrows, plays the disgraced automaker but also speaks to the camera about his character. Archival images and footage of DeLorean at the height of his fame, along with interviews with his son, are also shown.
DeLorean was an auto-industry executive who worked at Chrysler, Packard and General Motors before breaking away in 1973 to form his own DeLorean Motor Company. His signature car, featuring a stainless-steel body and gull-wing doors, arrived with great fanfare but unexpectedly flopped with the public. Charges of cocaine trafficking against DeLorean followed, and his company declared bankruptcy. By 1985, when Michael J. Fox hopped into a time-traveling DeLorean in the comedy "Back to the Future," the car had already become a cultural punchline.
"Framing John DeLorean" is scheduled for theatrical release June 7.

Full text: The Lenox Elementary School PTA in Baldwin looked to the stars to win the state's top award for efforts to make reading fun for children.
The local group - with the theme "Discover a New Universe with Books" - took the top spot in this year's Pick a Reading Partner program, the literacy initiative sponsored by the New York State PTA that asks adults to read with children for at least 15 minutes daily. The school's PTA earlier earned the Nassau County regional award.
Lenox Elementary's program was inspired by Jasmin Moghbeli, a NASA astronaut candidate who attended the school and graduated from Baldwin Senior High School. Activities included a Dress Like an Astronaut Day, an assembly with a StarLab portable planetarium, and a chart that used rockets to track each grade's volume of reading.
The theme was so popular that almost all of Lenox's approximately 300 students participated last school year, according to Camaker Heyward, the school's PARP chair. By comparison, only 15 students took part the previous year, she said.
"We are so proud of the example Lenox has set, and that their hard work and dedication to our students is being recognized across New York State," district Superintendent Shari Camhi said.
In Suffolk County, the PTA at Bayview Elementary School in West Islip won that regional award.
Bayview's program, which had the theme of "Cruising Through a Good Book," included boating-themed activities, such as ships that advanced on a world map based on the amount of minutes read by students. The grade that read the most won a pizza party.
AMITYVILLE
Virtual reality
The Amityville school district is introducing a virtual reality experience to support its curriculum through zSpace, a technology firm that combines elements of virtual and augmented reality. Lessons will range from life cycles of a butterfly to the history of flight. 
The additions will include a laptop cart of zSpace systems for use at Amityville Memorial High School, Edmund W. Miles Middle School and Park Avenue Memorial Elementary School, making Amityville the first school system with this resource on Long Island, district officials said. There also will be desktop units for each school.
"Students are drawn to technology, and zSpace provides an engaging way to support our curriculum," said Carole Polney, the district's assistant superintendent for technology and administrative services.
DEER PARK
Pumpkin flinging
Deer Park High School's "Dark Falcons" team placed second in the youth division of this year's Extreme Chunkin competition at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The event challenged 35 teams to design trebuchets to fling pumpkins as far as possible.
Deer Park's pumpkin traveled 860 feet. Their trebuchet was made of Microllam and included an aluminum arm, 12 commercial garage door springs, and a 12,000-pound electric winch.
"It was quite an exciting thing for them," Deer Park technology teacher Bruce Sander said of his 10-student team's achievement. "They're learning, they're listening, they're doing it."

Full text: ABC has pulled its low-performing "The Alec Baldwin Show" from its Sunday-at-10 p.m. time slot, starting Nov. 18, according to The Hollywood Reporter. As of Dec. 8, unaired new episodes will air in one of TV's deadliest time slots, Saturdays at 10 p.m. Production on all remaining episodes has already been completed.
ABC will air repeats of  "Shark Tank" on Sundays at 10, beginning on Nov. 18. On Sunday, Dec. 2 at 10 p.m., ABC will air "The Victoria Secret's Fashion Show Holiday Special," with holiday perennial favorite "The Sound of Music" airing on Dec. 16.
Baldwin's talk show debuted last month to 2 million viewers and by last week had slipped to less than 1.5 million.
The Long Island native, 60, made headlines last week when he was arrested following a dispute over a parking space in Manhattan.

Baldwin's new show isn't much smart Alec

Full text: WHAT IT'S ABOUT On the first edition Sunday of his prime-time ABC talk show, Alec Baldwin interviewed Robert De Niro and Taraji P. Henson.
MY SAY If "The Alec Baldwin Show" was on at 2 in the morning on Sundance, it would be the perfect nightcap, largely because it would put you to sleep. But on ABC Sundays at 10, where we usually meet great-looking TV doctors promising to save the world (or at least the hospital), or a pair of cops who finally chase down that terrorist, this new show is more like a duck waddling through the Times Square subway station at rush hour.
Baldwin is a convivial interviewer who can think on his feet, or sitting down, and we know this largely from his WNYC podcast, "Here's The Thing with Alec Baldwin." But here's the thing with "The Alec Baldwin Show": It's gaseous, wordy and self-congratulatory and almost entirely unnecessary. Another interview with Robert De Niro - a sphinx of a subject on his best days - where he's told, "Your career is indelible, it lives forever ... the goal in life is to give one performance, a great performance in a great movie, and you've done many of them. Do you have real pride about that?"
On the premiere, Baldwin and De Niro eventually got around to the subject that really exercises them these days - the guy in the White House - but even their dudgeon on this evergreen gripe seemed "low" as opposed to "high."
Baldwin: "I wanted to be the liberal that could throw a punch. It hasn't always gone the way I hoped it would go."
Then he asked De Niro "what's changed" about his newfound activism. (Recall, although not mentioned here for some reason, De Niro's bleeped outburst at the Tony Awards.)
But before De Niro could get around to an answer, the host was just getting warmed up with his question. He talked about how his good friend "Lorne Michaels" had asked him to play Trump on "SNL" and that it would just be for a little while because of course Trump would never win the election, and how Trump was a "drive-by presence" at all the A-list parties Baldwin went to, and ...
During this question/soliloquy, the thought began as a hint, then became a little more persistent, and finally, the full-blown revelation arriv

Full text: Plaza Elementary School in Baldwin has been named a 2018 National School of Character by a nonprofit organization based in the nation's capital, the sole school on Long Island and one of 73 nationwide to be accorded the distinction.
The school, with more than 400 students in kindergarten through fifth grade, received the honor from Character.org. To be considered, schools must demonstrate through a rigorous evaluation process that character development has had "a positive impact on academics, student behavior and school climate," the organization said.
Plaza Elementary will hold the designation for five years and be part of a network of schools that serve as models and mentors.
"The honor is extremely important, but the reason the school got the honor is more important," said Shari Camhi, the district's superintendent. "There's a real sense of belonging and understanding of what it means to be a part of this community."
The school's character education efforts range from mindfulness programs to Team ORCHID, a group of students who act as digital journalists and report on the school's positive news, such as community service projects and events including Field Day.
To be in the running, schools were required to complete an application about their character education efforts and undergo on-site visits and interviews.
"The most meaningful part is being able to have high expectations for our kids, because now we've achieved it," principal Mark Gray said of the designation.
Character.org named Plaza Elementary a State School of Character in February. Lee Road Elementary School in the Levittown school district also earned that honor.
COMMACK
New principals
The Commack school district has two new principals - Michael Larson at Commack Middle School and Jessica Santarpia at Rolling Hills Primary School.
Larson previously was an assistant principal at Commack High School. He began serving in the Commack system in 2007, teaching history, economics and government. He replaced Anthony Davidson.
"I look forward to embracing new learnings and maintaining the program of academic excellence that has been established at Commack Middle School," Larson said.
Santarpia, who started her career as a fifth-grade teacher in Valley Stream, had been an assistant principal at Stanley D. Saltzman East Memorial Elementary School in Farmingdale since 2013. She replaced Janet Studley, who retired.
"I'm thrilled to be joining the Rolling Hills learning community and I look forward to getting to know the children, families and staff in Commack," Santarpia said.
KINGS PARK
New principal
Jason Huntsman has been named principal of Kings Park High School. He replaced Lino Bracco, who retired.
Huntsman served the past four years as an assistant principal at Smithtown High School West. Before that, he was an assistant principal in Seaford and a special education and general education teacher in Hauppauge.
"Our focus will be to continue providing and cultivating opportunities for students to thrive in and out of the classroom," Huntsman said. "Our goal is to embrace our new infusion of technology to enhance communication and instruction across all areas."
NORTH BABYLON
New principal
John Ruggero has been appointed principal of Robert Moses Middle School. He replaced Elizabeth Walsh-Bulger, who now is a vice principal at Long Beach High School.
Ruggero previously was principal of Waverly Avenue Elementary School in Holtsville and before that was an assistant principal at Seneca Middle School in Holbrook. He began his career as a math teacher in 1998.
"I am excited to join the North Babylon family and look forward to working with the students, families and staff," Ruggero said. "I am anticipating a wonderful year filled with great learning opportunities and experiences for all of our students."

EAST ROCKAWAY
New principal
Richard Schaffer has been appointed principal of East Rockaway High School. He replaced Neil Lederer, who held the position on an interim basis.
Schaffer previously spent 17 years at Nathaniel Hawthorne Middle School 74 in Bayside, Queens, where he taught social studies before becoming dean and assistant principal.
"I look forward to helping the school move forward in terms of the district's five-year strategic plan, especially the use of technology in the classroom and improved parent communication," Schaffer said. "I plan to use my experience to help the administrative team analyze and evaluate the systems and structures of the school and collaboratively come to decisions about making improvements."

Keegan previously was the middle school's principal. She replaced James Ruck, who held the position on an interim basis.
McConaghy had served as an assistant principal at Great Neck South Middle School. Before that, he was assistant principal and guidance director at Bayport-Blue Point High School.
"To me, Herricks has always represented an educational environment where excellence is expected and educators work closely with students and parents to meet those high standards," McConaghy said. "This is an atmosphere where I think I can make positive contributions through collaboration with experienced and successful educational leaders."
VALLEY STREAM
New principal
Rachel Green is the new principal of North High School in the Valley Stream Central High School District. She replaced David Trizano, who retired.

Report: Baldwin to play Batman's dad in film

Full text: Alec Baldwin has joined Warner Bros.' origin-story movie about the DC Comics supervillain The Joker, playing a revisionist take on the father of Bruce Wayne.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Massapequa native Baldwin, 60, will play Thomas Wayne, who in comics canon is the slain father of the child who would grow up to become the superhero Batman. Yet rather than the ethical businessman of the comics and other media, this Thomas Wayne will be a hype-oriented cad the trade magazine calls reminiscent of "a 1980s Donald Trump." Baldwin's recurring portrayal of a modern-day Trump on "Saturday Night Live" has won the actor one of his three Emmy Awards.
Starring Joaquin Phoenix the as-yet-untitled film, which is unrelated to another upcoming Warner Bros. Joker movie starring Jared Leto, will be the studio's first under an ancillary brand of the DC Comics universe, not necessarily using the same actors or continuity as in other DC superhero movies.
Directed and co-written by Huntington native Todd Phillips, best known for his "Hangover" trio of comedies, the Joker origin film is set for release Oct. 4, 2019. In addition to Phoenix and Baldwin, the movie features Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Marc Maron.
Baldwin has not commented on social media.

Full text: More than two years after their short-lived romance and subsequent falling out, Hailey Baldwin is opening up about where she stands with Justin Bieber on Monday.
Hailey Baldwin almost lost an important friendship when she broke up with Justin Bieber. The two didn't end on the best terms when they broke up at the beginning of 2016, and now, she's dishing all about the split - and their reconciliation. "I met him when I was really young and he was one of my best friends," she told The Sunday Times. "Everybody knows that at a certain time that turned into something else, but that just happens when you're 18, 19. It was what it was. We went through a long period of time when we weren't friends."
The two didn't speak for "quite some time" during their fallout, according to Hailey, but now that a couple of years have gone by, they've both moved on. "There was a lot of weirdness that went on. We moved past that," the model said. "I'd never been through like that. But it brought us both to the realization that we just work much better as friends. He's somebody I really cherish. Now, it's a very mature situation. It's good."

Full text: Two Brooklyn men, one of them a teenager, were arrested in Baldwin after police said Tuesday the teen agreed to sell heroin to a respondent of an ad he'd placed on Craigslist.
Jalen Robinson, 16, of Marcy Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, was charged with third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and third-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance, Nassau County police said.
The driver, identified as Kamel Wells, 21, of Nostrand Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, was charged with fourth-degree criminal facilitation. Police said both men were arraigned Monday in First District Court in Hempstead.
It was not clear if either man was represented by counsel.
Court records show Wells was released on his own recognizance following arraignment. Robinson was ordered held on $30,000 bond or $15,000 cash bail. Records indicate he did not post bail or bond.
Police said that Long Island Heroin Task Force detectives and narcotics-vice bureau made the arrests and recovered 40 envelopes containing heroin, as well as cash, during the arrest of Robinson. Police did not disclose the location, but said the arrests of Robinson and Wells occurred at 5:56 p.m. Sunday.
According to police, Robinson placed the ad, then "agreed to sell a quantity of heroin to another."
Wells then drove Robinson to an undisclosed location in Baldwin, where the sale took place, police said.
Records indicate Robinson is due back in court on Wednesday, while Wells is due back in court on May 25.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nassau police on Monday arrested a Baldwin man and two teenagers after police said the juveniles posted a Snapchat video of one of them holding a semi-automatic handgun, officials said.
Police said they were informed of a Snapchat video in which a juvenile was holding a semi-automatic handgun at 1 a.m. Monday.
They responded to the Stanton Avenue home of Earl Thomas, 51, and found a .25 caliber handgun, the Smith and Wesson .40 caliber handgun that was used in the Snapchat video and a collapsible Kel-Tec, sub-2000- 9 mm "assault weapon," police said.
First Squad detectives said Thomas was charged with three counts of criminal possession of a firearm, third-degree criminal possession of a weapon and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.
The unidentified juveniles responsible for the video, ages 14 and 15, were charged with criminal possession of a weapon and issued desk appearance tickets; they must return to Family Court at a later date.
Thomas was arraigned in First District Court in Hempstead before Judge Eileen Goggin and was released after posting bail, said his attorney, Jerald S. Carter of Garden City.
"Mr. Thomas is a lifelong resident of Nassau County, a law-abiding citizen who would never place his child or anyone else's child in danger, and he is looking forward to his day in court," Carter said.

Full text: A Baldwin man who heard noises from his garage area early Thursday discovered a woman dressed in black inside his home, who ran and later was captured hiding in bushes a short distance away, Nassau police said.
Detectives said the victim, 33, had seen the attached garage door ajar at his Cramer Court home and a stranger in his hallway about 3:30 a.m.
The woman ran away, but responding First Precinct officers noticed her kneeling between two bushes on nearby Linkwood Drive. When they confronted her, she could not provide identification and gave investigators a false name, police said. She later was identified as Lillian Jackson, 50, of Washington Avenue in Roosevelt.
Two sets of car keys and an Apple iPod were found in her jacket pocket, items that belonged to the victim, officials said.
Jackson is scheduled to be arraigned Friday on charges of second-degree burglary and false personation at First District Court in Hempstead.

Donations pour in for Baldwin firefighter with Stage 4 cancer

Author: Blasey, Laura

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]28 Oct 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a Baldwin firefighter battles cancer, his community is rallying to help him pay his medical bills.
Michael Dolan, 28, was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, forcing him to take time off from his job as an engineer and his volunteer firefighting post with the Baldwin Fire Department.
Friends and fellow volunteer firefighters are leading an effort to raise money for him, including an online fundraiser and a fundraising drive scheduled for Saturday.
So far, the efforts have brought in more than $30,000 in donations.
"I'm lucky enough to have this amazing support structure," Dolan said.
Dolan, who had always been interested in firefighting, joined the Baldwin Fire Department in 2011.
"It sounds corny, but you want to help your community and give back," Dolan said. "It keeps life from getting boring."
But in August, he started to have trouble breathing. Doctors initially told him it was pneumonia, but after several more trips to the doctor and emergency room visits, he learned it was something much worse: a cancerous mass in his lungs.
Dolan has been doing well between surgery, radiation, immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatments at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, he said.
But his family was worried about how the bills were going to get paid, said Dolan's girlfriend, Anne Kenniff, 35, of Wantagh.
"I said, 'That's not something you should worry about right now,' " she added.
Kenniff set up a GoFundMe page on Aug. 31, hoping to coordinate a modest contribution for Dolan, but to her surprise, the page took off. It received nearly 1,000 shares on social media, and more than 400 people made donations that totaled more than $30,000 as of Friday.
Meanwhile, the Baldwin Fire Department has planned its own tribute. Dolan is a beloved member of his company, said Capt. James Carl.
"He's a smart kid, never had a bad word to say about anyone, and then this happens to him," Carl said.
The department will hold a fundraiser Saturday at Kitty O'Hara's in Baldwin, from 2 to 6 p.m. Attendees who make a $20 donation will have a chance to participate in raffles and auctions of high-end goods and gift baskets.
Dolan said he is floored by the donations and support.
But he also worries about other firefighters, he said. He supports a new state law that will offer volunteer firefighters benefits for certain cancers like his, starting in 2019.
"I'm younger, people are going to see this 28-year-old with cancer," he said. "But I'm always concerned, what about the girls and guys who don't have that support structure?"

Baldwin school district didn't preapprove OT, audit reports

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Baldwin school district did not preapprove overtime for its employees and paid overtime to several people who worked during their break periods, a state comptroller's audit found.
Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's office reviewed the Baldwin Union Free School District's overtime practices for noninstructional employees between July 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2016, according to a state report released last week.
"While overtime pay may be an expected cost of doing business, it must be carefully monitored and controlled to help minimize costs," the audit report stated. "Overtime should be incurred only when circumstances arise and cannot be avoided."
The district typically pays time and a half of an employee's hourly rate for overtime work, according to the audit. In the period reviewed, the district paid about $1.47 million in overtime to noninstructional employees.
The overtime was only approved after it was worked, and different overtime sheets required varying information from employees, the report stated.
Four employees in the district's secretarial unit were paid $2,120 in overtime for working through 200 of their 15-minute break periods, even though their standard workday includes two paid 15-minute breaks, during a three-month period, according to the audit. Those employees and two others were paid $5,497 in overtime for working during their unpaid lunch hour.
One employee in the secretarial unit was paid $3,206 in overtime for working through both break times and the lunch hour nearly every day from October 2016 through December 2016, the report stated. The employee's overtime sheets did not give a reason for the overtime.
The Board of Education should adopt an overtime policy that includes preapproval of overtime, the auditors recommended. The district should also stop paying overtime for break periods.
The district accepts the comptroller's recommendation, according to a letter from superintendent Shari Camhi.
"We are pleased that your examination did not find evidence of fraud, theft and or professional misconduct," the district letter stated.
Camhi could not be reached for comment on Monday when schools were closed.

Full text: A Nassau jury found a Baldwin man not guilty Friday of a stabbing that helped lead to a crackdown on a Hempstead Village bar.
Pedro Mendez-Ramos, 23, was cleared of first-degree assault and fourth-degree possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a March 2016 fight outside El Mariachi Loco restaurant and bar.
His attorney, Michael Alber of Commack, believes the Nassau County Court jury in Mineola did not find the witnesses, including the victim, credible.
Mendez-Ramos, the victim and others involved in the fight had known each other and were together at the bar, he said.
But their accounts of what happened and where differed from footage collected from village surveillance cameras, the defense attorney said. The footage showed a "fuzzy" image of Mendez-Ramos and the victim in a physical confrontation but does not show any stabbing, he said.
The video does show Mendez-Ramos walking backward as the victim and his friends confronted him, Alber said.
"This was a case where there were just rampant inconsistencies in their story," Alber said. "Mr. Mendez-Ramos is looking forward to moving on."
Brendon Brosh, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, confirmed the not guilty verdict, saying only "we respect the verdict."
The stabbing and other fights and crimes at or near the bar over the years prompted the state liquor authority and village officials to shut down the business, at least temporarily, ths year.

Alec Baldwin attends National Geographic ocean experience

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Island native Alec Baldwin is using his star power to highlight a new Times Square environmental production that aims to encourage people to help protect the earth's waters from pollution.
Wednesday evening, the two-time Emmy-winner, whose lampoon of President Donald Trump has put him in the political spotlight, attended the opening of a new National Geographic entertainment experience that has visitors walking the ocean floors and through coral reefs.
"There is no satire here. This is about protecting the environment," Baldwin said Wednesday evening. "This is a National Geographic production that evokes life that is under water. . . The earth is in a period of decline."
The production, "National Geographic Encounter: Ocean Odyssey" takes visitors and their families inside a 60,000-square-foot space that recreates the earth's oceans and seas. In the immersive experience, audiences can get up close and personal with moving images of sharks, a 50-foot Humpback whale and giant Humboldt squids.
From the Solomon Islands of the South Pacific to the northwest waters of North America, visitors feel the sensation of the ocean's current as stingrays and eels scurry at one's feet.
"It's scary," shouted one little girl Wednesday night as her friends laughed.
Baldwin, 59, of Amagansett, grew up in Massapequa. He has kept his ties to his Long Island roots and his love for its ocean waters by advocating for the protection of the Island's environment. In August, he hosted a panel discussion on climate change for the Hamptons Institute.
"We were at the beach yesterday with our little kids, and it was beautiful. But sometimes we forget that Long Island beaches get hammered and damaged from the storms," he said, referring to the hurricanes and storms that have affected the island's coastline.
The only water joke Baldwin mustered was having nature's waters "flush out Washington."
Penni Lugwig, 53, of Sag Harbor, is in the production. Her voice is part of a scene where beachcombers throw a birthday party and forget to collect the plastic balloons, which later end up in the water choking fish.
"I rescue wildlife all the time from plastic that they get entangled in and eat," said Ludwig, adding she hopes the production will build awareness.
A portion of the proceeds from ticket sales will fund National Geographic's nonprofit Pristine Seas Project, which identifies ocean waters that should be protected from pollution.

Nassau County seeks new life for historic Baldwin home

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 Sep 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1940077620?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nassau County is seeking new life for the historic George Sumner Kellogg House in Baldwin after it was saved from demolition by community members.
The county is considering selling or leasing the 117-year-old home to developers for use and development that are "consistent with its historical significance," according to Deputy County Executive Ed Ward.
The county issued a request for proposals (RFP) on Sept. 8, and it remains open until Oct. 11, according to the county's website.
"It stands today as the very last remaining artifact of a period of enormous transition in town, as well as a steward of local history and history of military involvement," the RFP read. "The house stands as a valuable link to the past for the town and surrounding communities."
The county is considering a sale or lease of up to 30 years, as well as a public-private partnership, but could reject all proposals. Any contract must be approved by the county legislature.
"We don't want it to fall apart," Ward said. "We're saying to anyone that's interested - including the Baldwin community - what would you like to do with this? What would you like to see?"
The green and white shingled Queen Anne-style home on Merrick Road was built in 1900 for Civil War veteran George Sumner Kellogg. The house, with a wraparound porch, sits on less than a half-acre of land in a residential and commercial area. Its hardwood floors, decorative cast crown moldings and stained glass sidelights remain intact, according to the RFP.
Owned by several families until 1982, the home was then used as antique store and phonograph repair shop until its sale to Nassau County in 2011 for $1 million.
The county scrapped its plans to build a police precinct on the razed property in the face of community opposition. The home has since been listed on state and national registers of historic places.
Karen Montalbano, vice president of the Baldwin Historical Society, who helped stop the county's plans for demolition, said her organization was "totally surprised" to see that a potential sale was on the table. She said the group is worried a sale could mean losing the home's historic workmanship and details.
"It's a survivor, it has a pretty original interior. It's made it through all this time," she said. "We asked for the house to be preserved for a reason."
Ward said the historical society was not contacted before the RFP was released because then it would have an unfair advantage if it filed a submission.
Steven Greenfield, vice president of the Baldwin Civic Association, said his organization wants to see the house used by the community, possibly for performances or the arts.
But, he noted, it made more sense to "sit tight until November," when a new county executive will be elected. Nassau Legis. Laura Curran (D-Baldwin), who represents the area, is running for county executive against Republican Jack Martins.
"It is my hope that the house will be restored back to its former glory, and repurposed in a manner that provides various benefits to the Baldwin community," Curran said in a statement.
"Nassau County has had a strong influence on national and international events and this presents an opportunity to preserve history for the benefit of future generations," Mollie Conkey Fullington, a spokeswoman for Martins, said in a statement.

In Baldwin school, learning happens in the summer garden

Full text: It may be summer, but Baldwin elementary school students are eager to exercise their green thumbs.
Throughout the season, students volunteer to maintain the gardens they created during the school year at five Baldwin elementary schools: Meadow, Brookside, Lenox, Steele and Plaza.
The gardens include tomatoes, lettuce, beans, kale, garlic and other spices. The garden at Meadow School was designed by seventh graders from the Baldwin Middle School, who drew up a blueprint and created the garden layout as a part of science class. The students worked with third- through fifth-graders to plant the garden, which was a "collaborative effort" because the schools are close to each other, says Nomi Rosen, administrator for professional development for Baldwin schools.
Families in the community are also involved in the garden upkeep. Each week, a different family volunteers on a first-come, first-served basis. Each family commits to care for the garden every other day or up to five days a week. Custodians help volunteers access the garden on weekdays.
"By helping in the gardens, kids aren't detached from the school during the summer months," says Anthony Mignella, the district's assistant superintendent of instruction. "They take great pride in it. They're continuing to learn when they see what happens when they don't take care of their garden. They're really doing academic work without realizing they're doing academic work - this is just another learning activity."
The community also benefits. The school typically donates the produce to a local food pantry.

Who's Cooking: Marian Ango of Baldwin

Author: Chattman, Lauren

Full text: Marian Ango does cardiology transcription for a medical group in Cedarhurst. She lives in Baldwin with her husband.
Tell me how this dish came about.
During superstorm Sandy, my son and daughter-in-law and grandchildren were staying here because they were flooded out of their home in Island Park. I had a lot of things in the refrigerator and the freezer. I was using things up as fast as I could. I had chicken, provolone, salami. My oven is electric, and before the power went out I came up with this dish. Even after I lost power (lucky for us it was only out for eight days), I cooked for them on my grill, making bacon and eggs, all kinds of stuff.
Do you often develop your own recipes?
I have a lot of recipes on my iPad, and I'll try them, and if I like them then maybe I'll make them again and change them a little bit next time. But I do make up things myself. I look at what I have around. My mother was the same way and she was also a great cook. I started cooking very early. When she was at work I'd start to get dinner ready before she got home.
Do you cook some of the same dishes that she did?
I'm three quarters German and a little bit Irish. My mother was German. She would make sauerbraten. I've made it a few times, but nobody is too crazy about it. My husband is Italian. Italian is more popular. If I say I'm making lasagna, everybody is happy.
Does your husband cook with you?
Not at all. He doesn't even like supermarkets. But he's great with helping me clean up.
What are some of your other specialties?
I'm a big baker. I make chocolate-chip cookies, crumb cake. I used to make cheesecake a lot. One of the things that's a real staple - years ago there was a recipe in Newsday for Chicken Fantasy. You saute chicken cutlets, there's garlic, scallions, basil, white wine, Muenster cheese and mushrooms. I do cook a lot of chicken, because it's so easy. Most people can eat it, while a lot of people are staying away from red meat. One of my granddaughters is a vegetarian, and when she comes I always try to think of something. If I'm going to make an Italian meat sauce, I'll make marinara for her. My other two granddaughters will eat almost anything. They were the two that were with me during Sandy.
Have you developed any variations on Chicken Sandy?
For a slightly fancier version, for company maybe, I'll skip the mayonnaise mixture and instead dip the stuffed and folded cutlets in flour, then beaten egg, and then panko crumbs. I'll refrigerate them for 30 minutes so the crumbs adhere. Then I'll brown them on both sides in a pan in some vegetable or olive oil, drain them, and then put them in a baking dish and cover them with thinly sliced roasted peppers or thin strips of salami and provolone. I'll pour 1/2 cup of chicken broth along with 2 tablespoons of white wine over the chicken and bake for 30 to 40 minutes.
CHICKEN SANDY
6 chicken cutlets
6 thin slices Genoa or hard salami
3 thin slices provolone
1/4 to 1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 to 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup seasoned panko bread crumbs
Thin slices of roasted peppers, salami and / or provolone, optional, for garnish
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.
2. Lay the cutlets flat on a cutting board. Place a slice of salami and half a slice of provolone on each cutlet. Fold over and press together.
3. Combine the mayonnaise and Parmesan in a small bowl. Lightly brush the mayonnaise mixture over the chicken and sprinkle with the panko. Transfer to the baking sheet and bake until the chicken is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. If desired, garnish with roasted peppers, salami and / or provolone. Makes 6 servings.

Alec Baldwin, Lindsay Lohan among celebs on and off Twitter

Full text: Did Ed Sheeran bid a tweet farewell to Twitter?
Early last week it was reported that the carrot-topped singer had left the social media site after being cyber-bullied. Then on Wednesday, he posted on Instagram that he hadn't left, but "I'm just not reading anything, except Harry Potter." He'll talk more about the Twitter controversy on "Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly" on Sunday, July 9, at 7 p.m. on NBC/4.
Sheeran isn't the first celeb to have an on-again/off-again relationship with Twitter. In fact, he's in good company:
WHO Alec Baldwin
WHEN HE LEFT So many times - in December 2011, July 2012 and June 2013.
WHY HE LEFT The last time was because his wife, Hilaria, was attacked for posting upbeat tweets during the funeral of actor James Gandolfini. Baldwin told Vanity Fair that he would never tweet again.
IS HE BACK? Never say never. Baldwin has both a personal account and another for his Alec Baldwin Foundation. Last fall, he also traded tweets with Donald Trump, who was not too fond of the actor's impersonation of him on "Saturday Night Live."
WHO Lindsay Lohan
WHEN SHE LEFT In January she wiped clean both her Twitter and Instagram accounts.
WHY SHE LEFT It seemed like she made a New Year's resolution to distance herself from social media. At the time, Lohan's rep said the actress was "in a period of renewal, and is very excited for what the new year holds."
IS SHE BACK? Not only is she back, but last week she sent out tweets telling Americans to stop bullying President Trump.
WHO Kanye West
WHEN HE LEFT Fans were dismayed one day in May when the rapper's Twitter and Instagram accounts had been deleted.
WHY HE LEFT The reason remains as much of a mystery as his cryptic speech at the 2015 Video Music Awards.
IS HE BACK? He's still missing in action.
WHO Leslie Jones
WHEN SHE LEFT July 19, 2016, following the release of her movie "Ghostbusters."
WHY SHE LEFT A negative review of the movie sparked a barrage of nasty tweets - many with a racist tone - against her. "All this hatred giving me the blues," she used for her signoff.
IS SHE BACK? Just two days after leaving, she tweeted her reason for returning: "Who else is gonna live tweet Game of Thrones!!"

Hempstead board awards contract for downtown Baldwin renewal

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]10 May 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896772897?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Hempstead Town Board voted Tuesday to award a contract for the redevelopment of downtown Baldwin, but Councilwoman Erin King Sweeney, who represents the area, abstained from the vote.
King Sweeney has abstained from voting on contract issues during the past several town board meetings, saying the board needs to adopt ethics reform regulations before awarding any more contracts.
She said such reform is needed in light of recent events, including the March arrest of Councilman Edward Ambrosino on income tax evasion and wire fraud charges. The charges were not related to his work as a town board member.
Tuesday's 6-0-1 vote means that town officials can move forward to revitalize Baldwin's business district with master developers Woodmere-based Basser-Kaufman and Garden City-based Engel Burman Group, which were selected for the project last year.
Revitalizing the hamlet that's home to 24,033 people has been in the works for 15 years, with officials citing previously depressed real estate and business economies as reasons the effort didn't progress.
The current plan calls for mixed-use buildings on the west side of Grand Avenue, north of Merrick Road, and on the north side of Merrick Road, west of Grand Avenue.
The developers must pay $4 million in immediate startup costs, officials said. Land acquisition sales cannot exceed $15 million. Hempstead Town must complete property appraisals in the next 90 days.
The developers will get property through private sales, but eminent domain is also a possibility, town officials said in a news release. The developers are to seek tax breaks through the town's Industrial Development Agency.
Steven Greenfield, vice president of the Baldwin Civic Association, asked the town board to do "whatever it takes" to redevelop the downtown.
"We're very excited about the prospect," he said.
Senior Councilwoman Dorothy Goosby, who represents part of Baldwin, and Ambrosino encouraged King Sweeney to not abstain.
"I certainly hope that you, as the person who shares Baldwin with me, will be voting for this," Goosby said. "The residents really need it, it's something that they want."
King Sweeney called the Baldwin project "long overdue." But she also said she has been kept in the dark on the contract.
"My call for ethics reform is based on principle. I just don't see how I can make an exception when dealing with a matter of ethics. This is a slippery slope that I am not willing to go down," King Sweeney said. "So, with a heavy heart and with no benefit to me politically, I must abstain on the Baldwin vote."
Goosby said after the meeting that she was disappointed King Sweeney didn't vote.
"I'm sorry" that King Sweeney abstained, Goosby said. "I don't think that's right for the residents."

Hempstead Town board to vote Tuesday on Baldwin development

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]09 May 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896266025?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Hempstead Town Board is to vote Tuesday on a contract to redevelop downtown Baldwin, officials said.
The town board last year approved Woodmere-based Basser-Kaufman and Garden City-based Engel Burman Group to be the project's master developers for the urban-renewal plan.
The town announced Tuesday's vote in a news release last week saying that Supervisor Anthony Santino and Senior Councilwoman Dorothy Goosby, who represents part of Baldwin, will propose the contract.
Councilwoman Erin King Sweeney, who represents the downtown area of Baldwin, was not mentioned in the release. Town spokesman Mike Deery said he reached out to King Sweeney to include her in the release but she declined.
In an interview, King Sweeney said her proposals for ethics reform, contract evaluations and transparency in light of recent events - including the arrest of Councilman Ed Ambrosino on income-tax evasion and wire fraud charges - have gone unanswered. She has abstained from previous votes on contracts and said she plans to do so on this one, too.
"So now, of course, the biggest vote that I'm dying to vote for comes and I don't see a way around it," she said Monday.
The redevelopment plan calls for mixed-use buildings on the west side of Grand Avenue, north of Merrick Road, and the north side of Merrick Road, west of Grand Avenue, the release said. Apartments will be housed above retail and restaurants in an area that's within walking distance to a train station. Officials are hoping to attract young professionals and families who want to downsize.
Previous efforts to revitalize the hamlet's downtown have failed, but Santino said the real estate and business economy has strengthened since then.
"Together, we can bring about exciting and sustainable growth that will restore luster to the business district of one of the loveliest communities in Hempstead Town," he said in the release.
If the legislation passes, the developers will pay $4 million in immediate startup costs, Deery said, and land acquisition sales cannot exceed $15 million.
The developers would acquire property through private sales, but eminent domain is an option if that isn't possible, the release said. The developers also plan to ask for tax breaks through the town's Industrial Development Agency.
Hempstead Town would complete appraisals in the 90 days after the contract is approved, officials said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Baldwin's Steph Strategakos was insulted. After Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK intentionally walked Fred Lucas - who had hit two hard doubles earlier in the game - with a runner on second and the score tied in the sixth inning, Strategakos was determined to make them pay.
He did exactly that, blasting a two-run double to right-centerfield to give Baldwin a two-run lead in an 8-3 victory in a Nassau AA-II baseball game yesterday.
"I knew right when I was going up, I was hitting the ball far and that's exactly what I did," Strategakos said. "I got up there and was like 'You know what? They shouldn't have pitched to me.' "
Reed Hoskins added a two-run single later in the inning to expand the lead for Baldwin (5-11) over the first-place Hawks (14-2).
Sophomore Mike Ahearn - who was put in the rotation after the Bruins' three starters suffered injuries according to coach Frank Esposito, tossed 6 2/3 strong innings for the win.- OWEN O'BRIEN
Hicksville 1, Oceanside 0: Austin Mars doubled and scored on a two-base error in the top of the fourth inning to lead Hicksville (6-9) in Nassau AA-I.

Farmingdale 10, Port Washington 9: Jacob Taormina's two-out, walk-off single in the seventh inning scored Robby Manetta to lead Farmingdale (9-7) in Nassau AA-I. Anthony Burriesci tied the score at 9 on a two-run single earlier in the inning.
Massapequa 6, Freeport 0: Nick Collins allowed a leadoff single, then retired 21 of the next 22 to lead Massapequa (14-3) in Nassau AA-I. He struck out five.
Division 1, Mepham 0: D.J. Melgar's two-out single drove in Brandon O'Brien in the bottom of the eighth inning in a non-league game. Melgar went 2-for-4 with the RBI for Division (14-5).
Sachem East 4, Longwood 0: Roman Dorosh struck out 15, walked one and allowed three hits in a complete game to lead Sachem East (12-7) in Suffolk I. Brendan Ryan, who went 2-for-3, homered on the first pitch in the bottom of the first.
Riverhead 2, Newfield 1: Chris Jehle's safety squeeze scored Peter Panciocco in the seventh to give Riverhead (8-8) a walk-off win in Suffolk III. Riverhead also tied the score at 1 in the sixth with a safety squeeze. Nick Dejewski struck out three and allowed five hits and one run in a complete-game victory.
North Babylon 13, Huntington 12: Jose Michael Santana hit a two-out, two-run single in the seventh inning to tie the game at 12 and followed it up with a sacrifice fly in the ninth to lift North Babylon (8-11) in Suffolk IV. Brian Primm went 4-for-5 with two doubles and four RBIs and Joe Barbuto went 4-for-6 with four runs scored.

St. Anthony's 8, Holy Trinity 0: Alyssa Seidler threw a no-hitter with 19 strikeouts and five walks to lead St. Anthony's (9-3) in a CHSAA game. This was Seidler's second no-hitter of the season, according to coach Mike Massa.

Why it's for sale Bart, 80, a retired pharmacist, says he wants to downsize to a one-story home in a warmer climate.
"I have a 16-by-32 heated in-ground pool and 60 feet of waterfront. The area around the pool and hot tub is pavered. It's perfect for entertaining. A boardwalk along the bulkhead is the width of the property. It's a deepwater dock. I used to dock my 35-foot yacht there and could come and go at low tide. There's electric and water at the dock and lantern lights, footlights, and outdoor speakers throughout the backyard. The gazebo looks like a carousel when lit . . . The first floor has a formal dining room and a large eat-in kitchen that was renovated four years ago along with the main-floor bathroom. The den has a wood-burning fireplace, a bar and sliders to the backyard. There's another fireplace in the living room with ceiling-to-floor brick and a vaulted ceiling. The house is on a concrete slab but, like most splanches, half the basement is below ground and the other half is above. The bedrooms are upstairs. The master suite has a bathroom, a walk-in closet plus a mirrored closet. I've done tons of entertaining here. Since it's on a dead-end, there's parking for everyone. The neighborhood is great; everyone takes care of their property . . . It's very multicultural, and everybody loves one another."

TROY, N.Y - This was Baldwin's night.
The Bruins could do no wrong, dethroning four-time defending champion Ossining, 73-45, in the state Class AA girls basketball final Saturday night at Hudson Valley CC.
Aziah Hudson had 22 points, Jenna Annecchiarico 14 and Montia Moon 12, leading the Bruins to the program's first state championship.
"The kids were ready for this," coach Tom Catapano said. "This is kind of a culmination of eight years of hard work. Tonight they completed their vision quest. I'm so proud of them. We answered the bell tonight."
It was a nearly perfect display of basketball as the Bruins paired efficient offense with their signature brand of pressure defense. Baldwin held Ossining's Andra Espinoza-Hunter, who on Friday was named Co-Miss New York Basketball, to six points after the first quarter. She finished with 19.
Baldwin (21-1) will play Mary Louis Academy at 1 p.m. Friday in the semifinals of the state Federation tournament at the Glens Falls Civic Center.
A lopsided second quarter swung the advantage in Baldwin's favor. After Espinoza-Hunter scored 13 of her team's 19 first-quarter points on a variety of jump shots, Baldwin held the University of Connecticut commit scoreless in the second.
Stifling defense by Moon and others kept the ball out of Espinoza-Hunter's hands, allowing the Bruins to go on an 18-4 run. Hudson hit a three-pointer from the top of the arc 53 seconds before the break as Baldwin built a 47-28 halftime lead.
" a phenomenal player . . . but I did what I do in every game - I defend," Moon said. "And I'm a very good defender, so that's what I did."
The Bruins extended their sizable advantage in the third quarter with plenty of help from Moon, who usually takes a backseat on offense. She hit a three-pointer from the left corner and added field goals on consecutive possessions, making it 54-30 with 6:16 left in the quarter.
"People overlook just how great of a defensive player she is. But you win championships with players like that," Catapano said.
Many of the Bruins' opportunities came on second chances, as their aggressiveness on the boards kept Ossining (21-6) in check.
Ossining coach Dan Ricci was called for his second technical foul with 3:38 left in the third quarter and was ejected. Annecchiarico made both free throws, giving Baldwin a 62-33 lead.
In the fourth quarter, Catapano rewarded his role players for a season's worth of work, allowing everyone on the roster to get playing time.
While the celebration will be sweet, Hudson knows there's still work to do at the Federation tournament.
"Monday," she said, "we're going to be back on our grind."

State education officials visit Baldwin High School, Molloy College

Author: Tyrrell, Joie

Full text: The state's top education officials came to Long Island Friday, touring an innovative college and career prep program in Baldwin before joining a group of regional educators at Molloy College discussing how to improve college readiness.
New York State Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia and Roger Tilles, who represents Long Island on the state Board of Regents, spent the morning visiting Baldwin High School, which has a program teaching students real-world skills in classrooms.
It's one the officials said they would like to see expand to public schools across the state.
"They are doing great work in getting kids connected to a work environment," Elia said.
Baldwin's personalized learning academies, in place for about six years, focus on five areas: STEM and engineering, global business and entrepreneurship, new media, medical and health sciences and law and government. The program runs in grades 9-12 and it includes professional shadow days with practitioners in the field, internships, clubs and activities.
The program will expand next year to include an academy on educating future teachers, Superintendent Shari Camhi said.
Classrooms are set up to reflect a professional workplace setting and in some cases, former professionals are the teachers.
"This is the way to go - to teach kids through relevancy," Tilles said.
On Friday, Elia toured an emergency medical class in which students practiced CPR on dummies. She also stopped in a virtual entrepreneurship class in which students have created a website and marketing plan for fashionable medical alert bracelets that they designed.
High school senior Marsha Smiekle, 17, is enrolled in the high school's medical academy. She learned through an internship and shadowing professionals that she wanted to be a nurse.
"I wouldn't replace this experience for anything and it set me up so nicely for my next four years in nursing school," said Marsha, who plans to attend Northeastern University in Boston in the fall.
Later Friday, Elia and Tilles attended the college readiness forum at Molloy College organized by the Long Island Regional Advisory Council on Higher Education - which includes a partnership between pre-K to 12 educators and higher-education officials.
Representatives from more than 70 Long Island school districts and several local college and university officials attended the presentation at the college's Rockville Centre campus.
The partnership shared results of a survey of Long Island colleges and universities, which found that among first-year college students, on average, 38.8 percent had enrolled in remedial math classes, 26.8 percent in remedial reading and 1.2 percent in remedial writing over the past five years.
Participation among college freshmen in some sort of remediation has dropped from 57.3 percent in 2012 to 46.8 percent last year, according to the survey.
The study also found that coordination between high schools and colleges is not widespread, and that a rigorous high school curriculum helps lead to success in college.
Next steps include sharing best practices, bringing together college and high school leadership and launching a pilot program for an islandwide math remediation effort, said Drew Bogner, Molloy president and co-chairman of the partnership.
"There's many things we can do but let's start first with the things that make the most sense," he said.

Baldwin's Trump back on 'SNL,' 'Complicit' skit spoofs Ivanka

Full text: "Saturday Night Live" Donald Trump impersonator and (incidentally) someone who told a tabloid TV show last week that he was probably done with his Donald Trump impersonation - Alec Baldwin, of course - returned to "SNL" in the cold open Saturday.
In a skit as commander in chief, he offered words of assurance to some assembled "troops" (the cast) that an alien invasion from outer space would be repelled. His words were not entirely reassuring, however: "What a beautiful day," said Trump/Baldwin. "Who loves Trump?"
His plan for repelling the alien invasion: "We are gonna bring coal back, so much coal, we're gonna say, 'Where did all that coal come from?' "
He was told by a commander leading the troops (played by cast member Kenan Thompson) that everyone in California had "been killed by the aliens."
Trump/Baldwin: "Even Arnold?"
Ba dum. (Naturally a reference to former California governor and erstwhile host of "The Apprentice," Arnold Schwarzenegger.)
The "president" was then shown a map of the United States and told that the aliens had taken over all the territory in green, then Thompson pointed to a small patch around Washington, D.C., and said, "This is us."
"This Is Us? That is a great show. I can't watch it because it's on NBC and NBC has been very unfair to me."
A minute later, the alien commander (Bobby Moynihan - also very much in green) arrived on stage and demanded to be taken "to your leader."
Trump/Baldwin, pointing to Thompson: "It's him."
The "SNL" cold open has long been a show signature, but especially during the 42nd season. Baldwin's Trump has been a sensation, and occasionally a target by he who has been targeted - the president himself, mostly via Twitter.
Baldwin told "Extra" last week that he was thinking of ending the impression, and indicated to The Associated Press that he was considering ending it as well.
But that was last week. Last night, return of the Trump.
Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson, who was host, spoofed Trump's daughter, Ivanka, in a parody commercial for a perfume called "Complicit," a fragrance "also available in Jeered," a reference to Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner.
Applying lipstick in a mirror, viewers saw opposite her Baldwin/Trump, also applying lipstick.
Johansson is also a spokesmodel for L'Oreal.
Now that we know what everyone else seems to be talking about - that guy with the orange wig - how was the rest of the show? Better than last week. While "SNL" thanks you for noticing, it's become a little too easy to overlook the more basic issues with "SNL" in the midst of this postelection, late-night TV new world order, where Everything Trump now seems to trump everything else that once passed for late-night TV, either on "SNL" or the other weeknight franchises. There's a late night arms race underway in Trump satire - fueled by ratings, newspaper and online coverage (like this), and a presumption that all a show has to do is mention the word "Trump" to spike ratings or clicks. (Guess what? It works.)
But "SNL's" Trump fixation, notably spearheaded by Baldwin/Trump, hasn't always worked to the show's advantage creatively, and in some instances to its acute disadvantage, with Saturday being the most recent example. A weak, too-obvious cold open - if this were a word association game, that latest immigration order leads to "aliens" leads to "Independence Day" leads to Trump as Bill Pullman's character on the movie. It was the second reach back to ancient pop cultural history in as many weeks. Last week, "Forrest Gump, next week, "Terminator 2: Judgement Day," or "The Silence of the Lambs," or "Jurassic Park" or "The Sixth Sense" or whatever other '90s franchise conveniently reflects whatever President Trump does or says?
Trump's new immigration order was last week, so I guess we should be grateful we got "Independence Day" as opposed to "Alien 3," "Men in Black" or "The Coneheads" (there was a movie, long forgotten?).
Saturday's "SNL" was otherwise an improvement over last week - the weakest episode of the year so far - with at least one keeper, the spoof of "Fire Island," Logo's upcoming Kelly Ripa-produced reality series about six men sharing a summer house. The spoof's subject was the fictitious companion series, "Cherry Grove," about a group of lesbians with babies (cast member Kate McKinnon: "Quiet! There are five miracles of home water birth in this house!).
The sketch about the Denver morning show that accidentally identifies a Denver zoo photographer as a pornographer was amusing, strictly written for and by a 14-year-old mindset, and (of more significance) yet another sketch that pushed cast member Mikey Day further and further into the spotlight. He's "SNL's" Next Big Thing, or "SNL" is making absolutely certain he will be.
The sketch written by men about women - because the women writers had taken off last Wednesday in honor of International Women's Day - was another highlight. There were the usual product placements - another reliable "SNL" fixture, also more and more obvious. I counted three - Purina, Subway, Olive Garden - and probably missed three others. But the show does work in them in efficiently, often effectively, the Olive Garden sketch as an example.
The post-"Weekend Update" sketches were good, this time another look at Shud the mermaid, and Leslie Jones as inelegant and incompetent Ninja warrior, Shanice Goodwin (she once injured herself playing this character).
Five-timer Johansson was just fine, too. She hasn't come back this many times because she mails it in. She's a good host who tackles material, good or bad, with enthusiasm, or at least what appears to be enthusiasm.
Then, finally, the "dog translator" at the top of the show, featuring the device that translates a dog's thoughts, which in this instance turned out to be pro-Trump thoughts. Maybe this was another movie reference, in this instance, "Up," and the character Dug, whose thoughts are translated via a special collar. Undeniably, it was another instance of the determination to keep that word and that name - "Trump" - front and center. At least the dog was cute.
But Trump as late-night-ratings propellant isn't going away, neither apparently is Baldwin, even if he is ambivalent about continuing. Business first, always. A break would be nice, though, no?
As Saturday proved, it would certainly be better for "SNL," too.

Full text: Facing an eerily similar situation to the past two Long Island Class AA championships, the Baldwin girls basketball team found another gear.
Central Islip cut the lead to one point with 1:28 left in the third quarter, but the Bruins closed the game on a 25-1 run and won, 56-31, in front of a packed house at SUNY Old Westbury on Saturday. They'll play next weekend in the state Final Four at Hudson Valley CC in Troy.
Aziah Hudson scored 11 straight points between the third and fourth quarters and finished with a game-high 22. Jenna Annecchiarico had 12 points, seven steals and six assists and sparked the Bruins with back-to-back steals then assists to Hudson in transition midway through the fourth.
"We didn't want to lose. We were tired of losing two years in a row," said Annecchiarico, whose Bruins lost to Commack in the past two Long Island Class AA title games. "We huddled in the beginning of fourth quarter and were like, 'It's our game. Let's go.' "
What ensued was a display of dominance. Central Islip closed the deficit to 31-30 on a three-pointer from Myha Lombert, but that's when the defensive intensity found another level.
Annecchiarico was relentless, showing quick feet and even quicker hands to prevent the Musketeers from setting their offense. The guard also hit three-pointers from opposite corners on consecutive possessions, the second coming with 3:03 left in the fourth quarter. That gave Baldwin a 49-30 lead.
"Jenna, she played phenomenal," said coach Tom Catapano. "I thought the whole team kind of played phenomenal in the fourth quarter. I knew we were going to be OK because we were defending all game long. It was just a matter of making some shots."
Making shots was a struggle in the first three quarters. Hudson made her first three-pointer of the game but then missed her next five. Annecchiarico didn't make a shot from distance until the aforementioned two. Even Kaia Harrison (10 points), a capable spot-up shooter, only hit once.
The Musketeers capitalized early, dominating at times with effective possessions. But when Baldwin gets in transition, it's dangerous.
That's exactly what happened in the fourth.
"It was scary because the last two years, that's exactly what happened," said senior Sarah Pulis, referencing both losses to Commack. "So we just had to stay calm, and we did, and we got it done."
Pulis was a key factor in allowing Baldwin to maintain possession when the offense was struggling, pulling in 10 of her 15 rebounds on the offensive glass.
"She is great; she's a monster," Annecchiarico said. "I'm so proud of her. She was definitely a main factor in this game."
Central Islip coach Paul Venturi also had reason to be proud. The Muskeeters upset top-seeded Commack in the county title game and said his team would be back in the Long Island championship
"They're such a great group of girls," he said. "They were unflappable all year. They were very resilient. Baldwin just had too much for them today; they're a great team. That's a program to emulate."
Venturi showed class in the fourth quarter, pulling seniors Chanel Taylor (eight points) and Anhya Jenkins (13) inside two minutes to let the packed Central Islip crowd stand and applaud.
"I wanted to honor them for what they did for the program and for their season," Venturi said. "I just wanted them to get the recognition from the fans."
Both seniors were resilient in attempts to break the Baldwin press, but unrelenting defense has been the backbone of the Bruins' run this season.
Now they'll attempt to ride that defense to a state title.

Full text: A Baldwin man convicted of burglary was sentenced Thursday in State Supreme Court in Mineola to 17 years to life after being deemed a "persistent violent felony offender," the Nassau district attorney's office said Friday.
John Robinson, 23, was convicted Dec. 13 of second-degree burglary, a violent felony, in connection with an October 2015 break-in at a Rockville Centre home. The trial lasted six days, and the jury deliberated about three days, prosecutors said.
"This persistent offender broke into and ransacked a home in broad daylight and then ran from the police and a brave neighbor when they tried to stop him," District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement.
Robinson's attorney could not be immediately reached for comment Friday.
A defendant is considered a persistent offender when he or she has at least two felony convictions. Court records show Robinson was sentenced in 2013 to three years and six months in prison for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon. Other details of his record were not immediately available Friday.
Authorities said two accomplices dropped off Robinson at a Sherman Avenue home, where he pushed in an air conditioning unit and got into the house through a basement window.
Robinson ransacked the house and was caught on surveillance video leaving about an hour later, carrying several bags stuffed with stolen items, prosecutors said.
The next-door neighbor spotted Robinson and gave chase, joined by a Rockville Centre officer who was responding to a call about a suspicious vehicle, authorities said.
That vehicle was occupied by Robinson's accomplices, Jashira Rodriguez and Fabrice Lafleur. Robinson jumped in and they drove off, but he was arrested the next day by Nassau police.
His accomplices later pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted burglary, prosecutors said.

Alec Baldwin returns to host 'SNL' for his 17th time

Author: Gay, Verne

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]12 Feb 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867271855?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: We fully expected a surprise when Alec Baldwin returned as host of "Saturday Night Live" for a 17th time - not wrong and not long to wait for one either. He didn't reprise Donald Trump in the cold open and didn't even mention Trump in his monologue.
Surprise!
Instead, Melissa McCarthy did some reprising of her own - the now-classic Trump press secretary, Sean Spicer - while Baldwin used those precious five-or-so monologue minutes to send up his own record run, with cast member Pete Davidson in the assist role. (Example: After a brief overview of that "SNL" run that began April 21, 1990, Davidson joked, "It's like someone soaked you in water the last 20 years.") He later starred in a "Cheetos pitch meeting," but not in a Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon) skit with Jake Tapper (Beck Bennett) in a "Fatal Attraction" encounter.
All good. All mostly funny, McCarthy especially (this week, the Spicer lectern morphed into a Segway). There was a genuine surprise too, much later in the show, when Tracy Morgan played one of Beyonce's (Sasheer Zamata) twins, in utero, alongside Keenan Thompson. Baldwin played the doctor.
But no Trump, or rather "Trump," at least in the early part of the show. Why? An old Lorne Michaels dictate perhaps: Never give the audience what they expect when they expect it.
To that end, Baldwin's Trump did arrive later in the show, appearing in "The People's Court" to adjudicate the decision on the travel ban from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Best line: "Mr. Trump, this is a TV court." Baldwin/Trump: "That's OK. I'm a TV president.") But no blood drawn, all fairly tame.
Was Baldwin's 17th a letdown? For plenty of viewers, certainly, because at some point over the past two months he was no longer just "Alec Baldwin" but "The Guy Who Plays Donald Trump." That may have been precisely the point Saturday night, for by playing down the latter he could remind viewers of the former. He does have a movie that's coming out one of these months ("Downsizing," with Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig). Trump - or his Trump - will not be making a cameo.
That a Baldwin-hosted "SNL" would turn into a TV and cultural event is unusual - there were those 16 others before this one, after all - but that it would also become a political event is a shocker. This may say more about the most comically extravagant administration in modern U.S. history than either Baldwin or "SNL," and so far, the new president has been very, very good to late-night TV.
As tides go, Trump has lifted just about all boats. "Late Night with Seth Meyers" is doing particularly well while "Late Show with Stephen Colbert" recently won only its second week since Colbert became host in 2015.
But "SNL" has been greatest beneficiary. The show always gets an election-year bump, and through late January was averaging about 7.5 million viewers per episode. That's hardly a record, even down slightly from the last election cycle. But as in all late-night TV, the real action arrives later in the week, when "SNL" picks up another 4 million streaming viewers. NBC says the "SNL" audience now stands as the biggest in 22 years.
So . . . why? Because late-night TV has become the fifth column of the Trump "oppo," and whether you like his performance or not (whether Trump does or not) Baldwin is leading the charge.
He's leader by virtue of his talent, his movies, "30 Rock," the Emmys, the tabloid battles, the "Words with Friends" and that whole sprawling "fame" thing that makes public figures seem even bigger than they are. But "SNL" and Baldwin together are part of television history, which makes this current run as Trump double so much bigger than even all that. Moreover, Trump as president-elect had tweeted his own blunderbuss critique of Baldwin (nothing yet as POTUS). That makes all this bigger still.
As an "SNL" host, Baldwin is literally without peer. He's an FOL - "Friend of Lorne" - which means he has proximity to power, and like Steve Martin, he's also the rare host who created an indelible character. As the other half of the Czech-born Festrunk Brothers, Georg (Dan Aykroyd was Yortuk), Martin may have created the more indelible one, but Baldwin's Pete Schweddy and his holiday culinary specialties were unforgettable - which is maybe even better (or worse) than "indelible."
Baldwin was always a good host, and very good performer, something less of an impersonator (Tony Bennett and Robert De Niro were the exceptions.) His Trump isn't even close to perfect. He may have the jutting lip right, but the voice is all wrong. He may have the hulking slump close to the original, but not the actual physical presence. Trump blows out word clouds that quickly dissipate. Baldwin's Trump mostly grumps.
Doesn't matter, and no one cares. Alec Baldwin is now TV's de facto Trump, the default Trump, the sendup Trump, the "SNL" Trump. The new president may tweet his disapproval, but that only feeds the power of his TV caricature, providing more material.
The new president is in a lose-lose position. As they say, don't pick fights with people who buy ink by the barrel. Trump probably doesn't want to pick a fight with a franchise that's 42 years old, survived half a dozen presidents, and is hot as ever - paradoxically thanks to him.
Resistance is futile. Resistance by Baldwin may now be futile too.

Elijah Bovell's 30 points sparks streak-shooting Baldwin

Author: Herzog, Bob

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Feb 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In their last meeting, Baldwin was victimized by streak-stopping Westbury. On Friday night, before a full house that created a playoff-like atmosphere, host Westbury was victimized by streak-shooting Baldwin.
"We had a very big chip on our shoulder," said Baldwin's Elijah Bovell, who scored 30 points and contributed eight rebounds and four steals in the Bruins' exciting 76-72 victory over host Westbury in the final Nassau AA-II game for both teams.
"They ruined our streaks. We remembered. We didn't want them to be undefeated in the league or get the automatic No. 1 seed," Baldwin coach Darius Burton said of Westbury, which had already clinched the league title but is now 11-1 and no longer assured of a top-seed for the upcoming playoffs.
Baldwin is 10-2, but when it lost to the Green Dragons. 63-57, on Jan. 17, it was the end of a 36-game home winning streak and 48-game unbeaten streak in league play. "The bus ride over here was quiet," Burton said.
Bovell made plenty of noise, beginning with a buzzer-beating three-pointer to end the first quarter. "That was my first basket and then I got a shooter's bounce on another three and I knew I was on."
Jonathan Dean (24 points) and Jalyn Dunlap (22 points off the bench) were on for Westbury, and Nasim Cylin had 12 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Bruins, who according to Burton had 21 assists among its 28 baskets. "It was a great atmosphere. Like the playoffs," said Bovell, who scored eight points in the fourth quarter, including a breakaway layup off an inbounds pass with 33 seconds left that provided an insurmountable 72-67 lead.
The fourth quarter was particularly tense, with seven lead changes. Darius Young (11 points), Westbury's leading scorer who was contained for most of the night, electrified the crowd with a long three from the right wing for a 57-56 lead with 5:50 left and a conventional three-point play off a pump-fake and driving layup for a 61-60 lead a minute later. He also assisted on Dean's corner three that tied it at 67 with 2:13 left.
That's when the Bruins seized the moment. Norman Wilson (nine points, seven assists) hit a pullup jumper and free throw and made the pass that sprung Bovell for his layup. Matt Trepeta added two free throws in that clinching 7-0 run.
"We wanted to attack the basket and when they contested the shot we pulled up and shot the three better," Burton said.
Especially Bovell, who had four from downtown. "Once I got the threes to go down, it got the rest of my game going," he said. "If they came up on me, I'd blow by. This game was a reminder that we're still here. We're Baldwin."

Full text: A Baldwin man was arraigned Monday on charges of selling heroin, crack cocaine and counterfeit $20 bills, police said.

Hempstead town gets grant to revitalize downtown Baldwin

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]27 Jan 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1862049041?accountid=37869

Abstract: The total $53 million project calls for 25,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space and about 140 apartments units to be built from 2408 to 2416 Grand Ave., north of Merrick Road.

Full text:   Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo awarded Hempstead Town a $458,470 grant Thursday to redevelop and revitalize downtown Baldwin along Grand Avenue.
The grant was unveiled Thursday afternoon by Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach), Legis. Laura Curran (D-Baldwin) and Hempstead council members Erin King Sweeney and Dorothy Goosby, along a deteriorated stretch of closed businesses across from a bowling alley and billiards hall.
The state grant will kick off a multimillion-dollar redevelopment for commercial mixed-use businesses on Grand Avenue. Officials said the $458,000 will pay for site plans to attract business and provide landscaping and parking.
"This is the most critical component to develop Baldwin further," Kaminsky said.
The grant falls under the state's Restore New York Communities Initiative.
Town board members approved an agreement in September to name Woodmere-based Basser-Kaufman and Garden City-based Engel Burman to be master developers of the Grand Avenue urban renewal plan.
The total $53 million project calls for 25,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space and about 140 apartments units to be built from 2408 to 2416 Grand Ave., north of Merrick Road.
Board members applied for the $458,000 grant, which follows previous commitments from the state to Baldwin, including LIRR improvements and a $5 million project to rebuild a bridge over Merrick Road.
Kaminsky said local officials have reached bipartisan agreements to help attract business and improve Baldwin's economy.
"We know attracting tenants is the key to revitalizing Baldwin," Kaminsky said. "There are too many empty stores here."
King Sweeney called the development the most important project in the district she shares with Goosby.
"I cannot wait to break ground on Grand Avenue," King Sweeney said. "We're working hard to make Main Street great again."
The town has attempted to redevelop the business district for more than a decade, but previous attempts with developers have failed, in part due to the recession.
Town officials will attempt to acquire vacant properties through private negotiations, but reserve the option of using eminent domain. There is no target date for work to begin once plans are drafted.
Baldwin Civic Association President Karen Montalbano said she hoped the grant funding would get the downtown revitalization started.
"This project has taken a long, long time," Montalbano said. "This is a great incentive to get the project moving along faster. Money is always an issue in development."

Full text:   One of Long Island's most dynamic playmakers now stands alone at the top of the Baldwin girls basketball all-time scoring list.
Aziah Hudson cut left, grabbed a pass from Kaia Harrison and went hard to the basket with 6:27 left in the first quarter of Tuesday's 78-21 win over Westbury, converting a layup and breaking the program's scoring mark.
The junior scored 14 points in the game, giving her 1,151 and breaking the previous record of 1,137 set by current East Rockaway girls basketball coach Karin Leary (formerly Byrnes) from 1986-1989. Hudson is Newsday's Athlete of the Week for her efforts.
"I've had the pleasure of coaching Aziah since third grade," coach Tom Catapano said. "One thing that she's always been natural at is putting the ball in the basket, especially in transition. She's a tremendous finisher."
Long strides and quick hands make her an asset in transition. But the conviction with which she slashes to the basket makes her difficult to contain. Even on nights when her jumper isn't falling - which is something she said she's trying to improve - Hudson still gets points.
"I'm working on shooting the ball," she said. "I feel like it's showing on the court, but I'm still working at it."
Catapano has seen strides this season. "That's something she's spent a lot of time in the offseason developing," he said. "She's now knocking down the long ball much more consistently."
If Hudson's jumper can become a reliable weapon, Baldwin will become even more difficult to defend. She is averaging 17.7 points after scoring nine points yesterday against East Meadow and has led the Bruins to the top of Newsday's weekly girls basketball rankings.
Already one of the most athletic and talented teams on Long Island, Baldwin's case for No. 1 improved on Dec. 28 after beating four-time defending Class AA champion Ossining, which hadn't lost to a state public school since March 2012.
"I feel like we've been underrated for a while," said Hudson, who had 21 points in the game. "Beating them made us better and stronger."
The Bruins boast significant talent in the backcourt with Hudson, Harrison and Jenna Annecchiarico, but they'll go as far as Hudson takes them. Catapano said she is growing into a leadership role and has embraced the challenge of leading one of Nassau's top programs.
With the scoring record now behind her, Hudson said she's now ready to focus on the task at hand - winning a county title and advancing to the state tournament.
She still has more than a full season left to play, and the elusive 2,000-point mark is certainly a possibility. But Hudson isn't thinking about that, either.
All she wants to do is slash her way to a title.

Elijah Bovell's 22 points help Baldwin top Harborfields

Author: Herzog, Bob

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 Jan 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1858393648?accountid=37869

Abstract: The Tornadoes forced several turnovers with an all-court press and crashed the offensive boards to score 11 straight points, nine by Alex Merhige (15 points) to cut the deficit to 47-39 with a minute left.

Full text:   At nine o'clock Saturday morning, in an empty gym at Baldwin High School, Elijah Bovell was shooting. This was two hours before Baldwin's team walk-through and five hours before its game against unbeaten Harborfields. The session seemed to jump-start Bovell's day.
The 6-2 wing scored 22 points, including nine during a key 13-0 run, as Baldwin defeated Harborfields, 49-42, in Game 3 of the Nassau-Suffolk Challenge at Elmont High School.
"He's a senior, so I always tell him, if not now, when," Baldwin coach Darius Burton said. "We used it as motivation that Harborfields was the only undefeated team left ."
Clearly, Bovell got the message. He dunked in transition to break a 16-all tie and followed with a pull-up jumper. He hit three free throws after being fouled on a downtown launch and added a putback as the Bruins scored 13 straight points for a 29-16 lead with 5:30 left in the second quarter.
Bovell's driving scoop produced the game's largest lead, 45-26, with 5:35 left in the fourth. But Harborfields (11-1) played Baldwin-style ball during a furious finish. The Tornadoes forced several turnovers with an all-court press and crashed the offensive boards to score 11 straight points, nine by Alex Merhige (15 points) to cut the deficit to 47-39 with a minute left. "We just don't have the athletes to play that way for 32 minutes," Harborfields coach John Tampori said.
Bovell ended the run with a one-handed tip-in that he surely didn't practice during his morning shooting session, and the Bruins held on. Baldwin does have the athleticism and depth to apply constant fullcourt pressure and the Bruins also were dominant on the glass until late in the fourth quarter.
"Our press is the key to everything we do," Bovell said. "They like to play a slow, halfcourt game and we like to run, so we tried to speed up the game and get it to our pace."
The Tornadoes executed their halfcourt offense well for much of the first quarter, building an 11-3 lead. But they eventually wilted against Baldwin's relentless pressure defense and offensive rebounding. "We're not big, but we're athletic," Burton said.
Especially Bovell. "Things opened up for me and that opens it up for everyone else," said Bovell, who has a greater role in the offense this season with the graduation of star Shane Gatling and the transfer of another All-Long Island talent, Jared Rhoden.
"I'm a big believer that individuals get better in the offseason and teams get better during the regular season," Burton said. "Elijah improved so much from March to November, but I want him to be even more assertive."
Bovell started asserting himself early Saturday, even before the game started.

Barbara Haber, 89, educator, librarian, author, of Baldwin dies

Author: Irizarry, Lisa

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1857997071?accountid=37869

Abstract: After developing a connection with a publisher of coffee table books, she wrote three: "The National Air and Space Museum," "Washington" and "Pennsylvania," all published by Smithmark Publishers Inc. In addition to her husband and Coffey, survivors include daughter Holly A. Haber, of Dallas, son-in-law Thomas Coffey, of Manhattan, granddaughter Skyler Coffey, of Manhattan, and grandson Dashiell Pashley, of Dallas.

Full text:   Barbara Haber even saw going to the grocery store as a chance to make new friends.
"My mom was really very special - the most positive person I had ever met in my life," said her daughter, Jill M. Coffey, 58. "She would talk to everyone. If she was standing in line, it was an opportunity for her to meet people. . . . She would talk to the cashier and get to know everything about them."
Haber, 89, a former teacher, librarian, author and longtime resident of Baldwin, died Jan. 3 of pneumonia at the Cornwall Manor nursing home in Cornwall, Pennsylvania.
"She was always happy and smiling," recalled Coffey, of Manhattan. "She never had a negative moment and would say, 'You have to take the good with the bad.' "
Much of Haber's happiness came from her extensive travels, bicycling with her husband, Walter, 88, of Cornwall, to whom she was married for 58 years. The couple loved their bikes, whether riding them along Wantagh Parkway, in Montauk, at Jones Beach or around Europe.
Helmut and Linda Scherner were close friends of the Habers and spoke about how the couple enjoyed each other. "When they lived in Baldwin, her husband was director of the Baldwin Library," said Helmut Scherner, 76. "We knew her at least 30 years," Scherner, a retired electrical contractor, said of himself and his wife, Linda, 73.
Scherner said he got to know the Lebanon, Pennsylvania-born Haber when he was head of the Baldwin Chamber of Commerce in 1976 and she was his secretary.
"Over the years, we became friends, and then in later years when they moved to Pennsylvania, we visited them," Scherner said. "She was very bubbly, a very nice lady and they were a very nice family."
The Habers lived in Baldwin for 17 years before retiring and moving in 1986 to Barbara Haber's childhood home near Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania.
Haber was the only child of the late U. Samuel and Ruth Donley Angle. She was a 1944 graduate of Lebanon High School, a 1948 graduate of Millersville State Teachers College (now Millersville University of Pennsylvania), and received a master's degree in English from Cornell University.
In the 1950s, Haber worked as an English teacher and librarian at Henry Houck Elementary School in Lebanon, Annville-Cleona High School in Pennsylvania and Massapequa High School.
Coffey said her mother, who was a member of the Baldwin Historical Society, had many interests and was a talented writer. After developing a connection with a publisher of coffee table books, she wrote three: "The National Air and Space Museum," "Washington" and "Pennsylvania," all published by Smithmark Publishers Inc.
In addition to her husband and Coffey, survivors include daughter Holly A. Haber, of Dallas, son-in-law Thomas Coffey, of Manhattan, granddaughter Skyler Coffey, of Manhattan, and grandson Dashiell Pashley, of Dallas.
A funeral service was held for Haber on Jan. 6 in Annville, and she was buried at Indiantown Gap National Cemetery. Contributions in Haber's name may be made to the Crazy Horse Memorial at 12151 Avenue of the Chiefs, Crazy Horse, South Dakota, 57730, or crazyhorsememorial.org

Abstract: According to detectives, First Precinct patrol officers who had been assigned to investigate a possible traffic hazard noticed Philbert sitting in his car at Prince Street and Schuman Place.

Full text:   Nassau County police have charged a Baldwin man in connection with packages stolen from several homes in the area, police said Sunday.
Jonathan Philbert, 19, of 1516 Waddell Street, faces charges of petty larceny and unlawful possession of marijuana. According to detectives, First Precinct patrol officers who had been assigned to investigate a possible traffic hazard noticed Philbert sitting in his car at Prince Street and Schuman Place.

Police determined that these packages had been removed from outside of homes in the Baldwin area, officials said.
Philbert was arrested at the scene without incident, police said.
Detectives have asked anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a similar crime to contact the First Squad at 573-6152.

Elijah Bovell to Derrick Ruffin a good team for Baldwin

Author: Herzog, Bob

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]04 Dec 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845496467?accountid=37869

Abstract: "Just a broken play, but I saw Derrick was wide open and I passed him the ball," said Bovell, who led Baldwin in its season opener with 22 points.

Full text:   It was a broken play, but it fixed Baldwin.
Elijah Bovell was shut off on his driving attempt and surrounded by defenders. He spotted Derrick Ruffin alone on the right wing and delivered a desperate crosscourt pass. Ruffin made his only field goal of the game - a three-pointer that put the Bruins ahead by a point - and he and Bovell converted one-and-ones in the final seconds as Baldwin held off Mount St. Michael, 60-57, on Saturday in the Upstate-Downstate Challenge at Uniondale.
"Just a broken play, but I saw Derrick was wide open and I passed him the ball," said Bovell, who led Baldwin in its season opener with 22 points. "I knew he could hit the shot. He makes it all the time in practice."
With All-Long Island player Jared Rhoden having transferred to Our Saviour Lutheran (Bronx), Bovell should be Baldwin's prime scoring threat this season. He hit a three-pointer earlier in the fourth quarter for a one-point lead and made two free throws after a drive to put Baldwin ahead 53-51 with 5:38 left.
Neither team scored for more than 3 1/2 minutes before Elijah Buchanan and Jacob Rod riguez scored inside to put the team from the Bronx ahead 55-53 with 1:08 left. Point guard Jabeon Bivins, another player from last season's Long Island Class AA champion, got the ball to Bovell, but the Mountaineers wouldn't let him get to the rim.
He settled for Ruffin, who started in place of injured Norman Wilson. "He'll probably be our sixth man when Norman comes back," Baldwin coach Darius Burton said. "He can shoot the three, but I call him the Junkyard Dog because he does the dirty work like rebound and play defense."
All of the Bruins roll up their sleeves on defense, and their pressure helped erase an early 13-3 deficit.
"We could've been blown out of the building," Burton said. "We were a little nervous at first with a lot of new faces. But we're built on defense. We extended our pressure and sped up the tempo. We wanted to make them uncomfortable."

Raphael D. Oyague arraigned in Baldwin killing, police say

Author: Uda, Rachel; Olson, David

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]25 Nov 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1844390873?accountid=37869

Abstract: [...]court records show a bench warrant had been issued for Oyague on a third-degree misdemeanor assault charge stemming from an August 2012 incident in which papers say he tackled a woman who identified herself in a deposition as his girlfriend.

Full text:   A Baldwin man charged with killing a woman after they argued over payment for sex beat the victim to death with a hammer in his apartment before leaving her body nearby, Nassau police said yesterday.
Officers took Raphael D. Oyague, 36, into custody Wednesday after detectives tracked a trail of blood from where the body was found back to the rear door of his apartment, police said at a news conference.
Police did not release the woman's name but court papers identified her as Deanna M. Wingender. An address for Wingender was not included in the court papers.
Earlier, police had said the victim was in her mid-20s.
Oyague had contacted the woman on the Craigslist website and arranged to meet her Tuesday at his apartment, said Det. Capt. John Azzata, commanding officer of Nassau's Homicide Squad.
A car service dropped her off at Oyague's residence between 6 and 9 p.m., Azzata said. Sometime after 10 p.m., Oyague killed the woman and dumped her body, Azzata said.
The encounter was for sex and "there was supposed to be compensation for that sex," Azzata said. "There was an argument that ensued, and the subject ultimately hit our victim with a hammer multiple times."
Oyague pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder Thursday at First District Court in Hempstead and was ordered held without bail. He is scheduled to return to court Monday.
After the hearing, Oyague's relatives - a man and a woman - declined to comment as they left the courtroom.
Oyague has one felony conviction for violating a court order of protection and three misdemeanors, including one for assault and another for drunken driving, police said.
In addition, court records show a bench warrant had been issued for Oyague on a third-degree misdemeanor assault charge stemming from an August 2012 incident in which papers say he tackled a woman who identified herself in a deposition as his girlfriend.
Oyague also was charged with two counts of second-degree harassment in the incident. He was released on $1,000 bail on Aug. 30, 2012, but failed to appear in court, and the warrant for his arrest was issued in February 2014, court records show.
He is scheduled to appear in First District Court in Hempstead on the assault case Tuesday.
His arrest Wednesday came on the same day authorities said officers responding to a 911 call found the woman's body behind a building on 97 Merrick Rd.
A strip of two-story buildings that includes a bar and restaurant, a pizzeria and apartment units line the section of Merrick Road just east of Grand Avenue where the body was discovered.
Heidi Taveras of Rockville Centre, who works at the State Farm office beneath Oyague's Baldwin apartment, said Thursday she saw Oyague in the building only occasionally. She said she believes he moved into the apartment about two months ago.
"It's insane. We work here and we use this door to go in and out," Taveras said, gesturing toward the building's rear exit through which police said Oyague carried the body.
Shante Jackson, 31, said Thursday that she was returning home from picking up her son from school Wednesday when police at the scene told her about the body.
"It makes you not feel safe at home anymore, for something like this to happen so close by," said Jackson, a mother of two, who lives in an apartment that overlooks the area where the body was found.
A man who lives next to the house where Oyague's mother lived until a few years ago said he didn't know Oyague well.
"It didn't seem like the type who would bang someone over the head with a hammer," Dwight McDonald, 42, said.
Police said the body was found by two delivery workers who saw something in the leaves, recognized it as a body, and called 911.

Abstract: Running backs John DeBique and Matt Washington provided all the power and speed the Bruins needed to outlast host East Meadow in a muddy Nassau I football game on Saturday.

Full text:   Mother Nature brought the rain and wind . . . and Baldwin brought the thunder and lightning.
Running backs John DeBique and Matt Washington provided all the power and speed the Bruins needed to outlast host East Meadow in a muddy Nassau I football game on Saturday.
Quarterback Norman Wilson's 1-yard run early in the fourth quarter propelled Baldwin to a 19-15 win.
"It's going to take like five washes to get all this mud out," said DeBique, whose white jersey was caked in so much mud that it was difficult to read the No. 34 on his back. "This is the best. Just to be in the mud, there's nothing better than this."
DeBique was covered for good reason. He made 16 tackles on defense, chasing down ball carriers and driving them down into the grass field covered in muck.
Several of his stops came on East Meadow's final drive, which began from Baldwin's 36-yard line with 2:40 left in the fourth quarter after Paul Imperiale blocked a punt.
"Without him, we don't stop anybody," coach Steve Carroll said.
The Jets got as close as the Bruins' 24-yard line before a heave into the endzone on fourth-and-4 was batted down by defensive back Mohammed Alam, sealing the win.
DeBique catalyzed the offense too, running 11 times for 78 yards and a touchdown. His 31-yard score just before halftime capped a two-play, 64-yard drive that took only 25.2 seconds off the clock and started when Wilson found Tommy Airey for a 33-yard catch down the middle. It was 12-7, Baldwin, at halftime.
The Baldwin (4-3) offense, which operated out of the Power-I, thrived off quick-strike scoring. On the opening play from scrimmage, Washington took a counter off left guard, found a hole and sprinted 80 yards into the endzone.
"Anderson (Sylvain) pulled and made a good block, and I saw a cut," Washington said.
Sylvain, Jared Smith, Armando Roman, Joe Gallogher and Jimmy Velasquez were sturdy on the offensive line, allowing Baldwin to control possession.
"We know that this type of weather caters to this offense," Carroll said. "We had all sorts of spread stuff and gadget stuff ready for today, but the weather took it away from us."
East Meadow (3-4) also kept the ball on the ground, feeding Joe Matchekosky (two touchdowns), Justin Reyes and J.R. Howell.
But Baldwin's dynamic duo was too much.

Baldwin doctor sentenced for illegal painkiller prescriptions, AG says

Abstract: In May 2015, Persaud pleaded guilty to criminal sale of prescriptions for a controlled substance and fourth-degree criminal tax fraud, the attorney general said.

Full text:   A Baldwin doctor was sentenced to 6 months in prison and 5 years' probation for illegally selling oxycodone prescriptions, Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced Thursday.
Dr. Anand Persaud, 47, also provided prescriptions without performing required medical examinations of patients, Schneiderman said in a news release.
At the time of his arrest in July 2013, Schneiderman said Persaud was one of the state's top prescribers of pain pills.
Investigators said Persaud operated a bogus "pain management" practice where patients with substance abuse problems were charged $250 or more for an oxycodone prescription.
The patients needed counseling and treatment for their addictions, but were instead "enabled" with prescription drugs, the attorney general said.
"It's unconscionable that a doctor, a trusted licensed professional, would violate his professional duties and abuse his license to traffic in prescriptions for narcotics," Schneiderman said in a statement.
Persaud lost his medical license in August.
In May 2015, Persaud pleaded guilty to criminal sale of prescriptions for a controlled substance and fourth-degree criminal tax fraud, the attorney general said.
He was arrested by the state attorney general's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit after a long-term investigation.
Officials said Persaud admitted to knowingly selling a prescription of oxycodone to a patient for $250 in cash on Jan. 15, 2013, acknowledging that the patient had supposedly only suffered from opiate withdrawal, the attorney general said.
On two other occasions, Persaud wrote additional oxycodone prescriptions for that same patient in exchange for money, the attorney general said.
He also admitted to providing prescriptions for 10 other patients between 2011 and 2013 in exchange for $250 and $300 cash each.
Meanwhile, Persaud also admitted to under-reporting his income on his 2011 New York State personal income tax return by about $67,000, and that he filed a false New York State tax return the following year, Schneiderman said.
Acting state Supreme Court Justice Francis Ricigliano imposed sentence in Mineola.

Calvin Pryor to appeal $24G fine for hit on Doug Baldwin

Author: Glauber, Bob

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]06 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826083536?accountid=37869

Abstract: [...]the flag he drew for unnecessary roughness against the Seahawks was the first in two-plus seasons in the NFL. Pryor said the NFL informed him that he was fined for hitting Baldwin above the neck and shoulder area.

Full text:   FLORHAM PARK, N.J. - Jets safety Calvin Pryor is known as one of the NFL's hardest hitters, but he's also one of the least penalized. In fact, the flag he drew for unnecessary roughness against the Seahawks was the first in two-plus seasons in the NFL.
It was a costly one, too. Pryor was fined $24,309 for hitting a defenseless receiver when he crashed into receiver Doug Baldwin on a 37-yard reception. Baldwin got up slowly after the hit, but finished the game.
"I don't feel was worth $25,000," Pryor said. "I'm going to appeal it and see how it goes. It happened so fast. When I spun around, was already falling. That's the only hit I could make. I tried to lower the target a little lower. It was just a bang-bang play."
Pryor said the NFL informed him that he was fined for hitting Baldwin above the neck and shoulder area.
Asked what he thought a fair amount would be for the hit, Pryor replied, "Zero. I'm just thinking about my daughter and my family and all the I could do with $25,000. But it is what it is. I'm a clean hitter. I never got flagged for any hit. This is my first one dating back to high school, college. Kind of surprised."
Pryor and the Jets' secondary has not played particularly well through their 1-3 start, and things don't get any easier when they face the Steelers on Sunday at Heinz Field. The Steelers demolished the Chiefs, 43-14, on Sunday night, a week after suffering a 34-3 rout in Philadelphia.
"We just have to click together and make plays on the ball," he said. "That's something we haven't been doing. As a group, we're not discouraged. I think the communication was better. Everybody was on the same page. Just got to go have fun and enjoy it."
Pryor has immense respect for Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who remains one of the game's elite players in his 13th NFL season.
"He does a great job buying time," Pryor said. "He's not a fast guy and doesn't like to get out of the pocket, but he buys time for his receivers to get down the field. He's definitely one of the best quarterbacks in the league. Just going to be a tough matchup on Sunday."
It's all the more difficult because the Jets may not have cornerback Darrelle Revis, who hasn't practiced this week because of a hamstring injury. Not the best way to go into a game against All-Pro receiver Antonio Brown.
"Very challenging, very tough receiver," Pryor said of Brown. "He can do it all. He gets the ball a ton. He's a tough matchup for anybody. Just have to line up and try to contain him the best way we can."
As for his own play, Pryor said there's room for improvement; he had a handful of missed assignments in Sunday's loss to the Seahawks.
"I definitely have to play better, I can say that," he said.
How to do it against a team with as potent an offense as the Steelers?
"Just get back to the basics," he said. "If you believe in one another, you believe in the guy next to you, he's got your back, there's no reason to be intimidated by it at all."

Baldwin's Trump, McKinnon's Clinton start SNL season

Author: Gay, Verne

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]02 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824955925?accountid=37869

Abstract: [...]that curious moment during the real debate, when the real Trump said he had told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was against the war in Iraq?

Full text:   Meet your new Donald Trump impressionist on "Saturday Night Live," even though introductions are probably not necessary. With a little bit of Jack Donaghy from "30 Rock" and a lot of fake yellow hair from the "SNL" costume closet, Alec Baldwin . . .
He jutted out his lip, squinted those blue eyes, then said in his best basso Donald voice, "Good evening, America. I'm going to be so good tonight. So presidential and . . . "
Kate McKinnon, as Hillary Clinton, didn't have all that much to do in the open, other than gloat, and smile and eventually ask, "can America vote right now?"
As Trump, Baldwin was as expected and the jokes - which wrote themselves - were, too. About his mic, which he claimed "she broke and took to Kenya, and now it's broken." He sniffed quite a bit, too, and interjected "wrong" as well, when Hillary/McKinnon spoke, or in one sequence, "wrong, wrong, wronger . . . "
And that curious moment during the real debate, when the real Trump said he had told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was against the war in Iraq? That was rendered this way by Baldwin/Trump: "I told him in private and leaned over and whispered in his ear. The next thing I knew I was kissing Sean Hannity . . . "
Besides strange - obviously - was it good? Well, in parts certainly. Otherwise, work is needed.
One problem for "SNL" is that everyone has a Trump impression, even your next door neighbor. They're so ubiquitous that they've lost their edge - to entertain or satirize or demolish, which is probably "SNL's" intention, particularly after the network has been accused of coddling him. (See: Matt Lauer.)
Jimmy Fallon, also accused by critics of being too nice to Trump recently (See: Hair tousling), has a decent impression. Dana Carvey certainly does, too, but he hasn't been here in 23 years. Anthony Atamanuik, of Upright Citizen's Brigade - also star of Comedy Central's occasional "debate" series, "Trump vs. Bernie" - has one of the best. He doesn't work here at all.
That leaves Lorne Michaels' friend and host of sixteen "SNL" editions, who also does a near-perfect Tracy Morgan.
Baldwin told The Washington Post's David Weigel last week, "The more you descend into kind of incoherent sensibility, the closer you get to the truth of who he is," adding - no doubt ruefully and pragmatically: "No one's mind is being changed . . . The people who love Trump hate my guts already."

Coalhouse Grill review: Rustic Jamaican food in Baldwin

Abstract: The twice-cooked braised oxtail, having spent enough time on the heat to breakdown the tough connective tissue, was silky and flavorful in a sauce of carrots, butter beans, tomato pastes, hot peppers and butter.

Full text:   Coalhouse Grill
844 Merrick Rd., Baldwin
516-442-7063
FOOD * *-1/2
COST $$
SERVICE Inexperienced
AMBIENCE Rustic dishes served up in a casual dining room filled with stained wood and Caribbean music.
ESSENTIALS Closed Sundays. Lunch and dinner, noon to 9 p.m. Monday to Wednesday, noon to 10 p.m. Thursday to Saturday. Major credit cards and reservations accepted, delivery, takeout, parking lot.
Like many restaurants serving foreign cuisine, the walls inside Coalhouse Grill are designed to express the food's origins. But where a pizzeria's hokey painted walls of hills and grapevines charm easily, the muted walls with rustic chair rail molding in the dining room at Coalhouse Grill require a little more effort. The stained tables, made from the same common lumber used as floor joists, and the bar, built with oriented strand board typically used for wall sheathing, are utilitarian. It's all a little rough around the edges, but honest - just like the food.
Chef Nathalee Francis, who moved to the United States at 19 and now owns the five-month-old restaurant with her husband, Patrick, knows both sides of her native Jamaica. There are the beaches, the tourists and sugary cocktails with umbrellas, but there is also the inside of her grandfather's butcher shop, where he'd pack up cuts of beef, pork, goat and chicken and send her home to cook them. Francis described her restaurant's interior as a reflection of that Jamaica, complete with a pudgy banana tree planted in the center of the dining room.
A dish familiar to most Jamaicans is the ackee and saltfish starter. Considered a national dish, it's a savory and creamy bowl (the mouth feel is similar to a pile of soft egg curds) that combines salted cod sauteed with ackee, a popular island fruit. Paired with four rounds of crispy bammy (dried yucca or cassava) the dish is worth more than the $9 asking price, even if the accompanying, never-ending spiralized cucumber proved hard to share. Small details like that get in the way, as it did when our pleasant waitress distributed square bowls, instead of roomier plates, making it hard to get all the dish's elements together.
There were more instances when the menu didn't reflect what reached the table. The green salad's list of mesclun, chickpeas, apples and grapes became romaine, more spiralized cucumber, canned tangerine segments, carrots and green peas. It happened again with the sides that should have accompanied the broiled salmon. Instead of potatoes and blended vegetables I received the standard sides for most of the entrees: rice with gungo peas, fried sweet plantains, and a scoop of sauteed cabbage. I'm not sure adhering to the menu would have helped in either case as the already sweet salad had an even sweeter raspberry-walnut vinaigrette, and the salmon was riddled with bones.
Traditional, time-intensive main courses were more consistent. The twice-cooked braised oxtail, having spent enough time on the heat to breakdown the tough connective tissue, was silky and flavorful in a sauce of carrots, butter beans, tomato pastes, hot peppers and butter. Floating in that sauce were oblong, pillowy spinner dumplings. The stewed, bone-in segments of tender chicken were coated in a rich brown sauce flavored with carrots and potatoes. The jerk chicken and pork both spend about 24 hours in the same basic rub that includes Scotch bonnet pepper, pimentos, and thyme. The quarter chicken's mildly spicy flavor is tempered by the bright and sweet mango salsa, while the six or so hunks of pork shoulder sit squarely on the savory-spicy side. Francis said the kitchen can tailor the heat level per request, though that offer never made it to our table.
The juices are another bright spot, the best of which is a zippy natural, unfermented ginger beer made from the root, water, lemon juice and some sugar. End the meal with one of the clever desserts, cakes served in Mason jars with plastic spoons so you can eat them at the table or on your walk out of the restaurant. The carrot cake was moist, with a nice hint of cinnamon and a measured hand with the sweetness of the frosting.
Get the most out of Coalhouse Grill by sticking with the traditional plates and asking questions about the preparation. With a ginger beer in hand, you won't be tricked into thinking you're on a touristy beach, but it sure feels like a Jamaican kitchen.

Orbera balloon system helps Baldwin nurse lose weight

Author: Donahue-Smukler, Ann

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]30 Aug 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1814847246?accountid=37869

Abstract: [...]her body accepted the balloon, she had nausea and drank only clear liquids.

Full text:   Peggy O'Donnell
58, Baldwin
Occupation Senior nurse practitioner at South Nassau Communities Hospital
Height 5-foot-6
Before Nov. 2015: 224
Current Aug. 2016: 178
HER STORY
In her job, O'Donnell talks to patients about staying healthy, not smoking and losing weight. She never needed her own advice until she reached her 50s and metabolic changes resulted in weight gain. "It creeps up and the next thing I knew I had my own challenge," she says.
With a BMI of 34, O'Donnell was characterized as "modestly obese." For a long time she didn't qualify for any bariatric procedures. Earlier this year, she learned about Orbera, a temporary nonsurgical balloon system. With this approach, a patient is put under anesthesia briefly and a balloon is inserted through the mouth into the stomach and filled with about three cups of a saline solution essentially to create the sense of feeling full.
O'Donnell said she was motivated to lose weight: She recently welcomed her fourth grandchild and just received her doctoral degree. Plus, her mom recently celebrated her 90th birthday. "I had a lot to live for and I wanted to live the second half of my life in a healthy fashion, she says. She had the procedure March 15. The first week was tough she said. Until her body accepted the balloon, she had nausea and drank only clear liquids. The discomfort lasted a week. Any subsequent periods of nausea she "talked herself through." "I haven't missed a beat. I work full time and am active with my family," said O'Donnell. The balloon will be removed Sept. 2, just shy of six months.
HER DIET
O'Donnell makes a fruit smoothie with protein and yogurt for breakfast. She'll have half a turkey sandwich for lunch, and usually a small portion of baked fish, meatballs, or chicken and vegetables for dinner. She does little snacking and instead has noncarbonated fruit-flavored water (drinking liquids while eating is not recommended).
HER EXERCISE
O'Donnell works on muscle training once a week with a personal trainer and walks or bikes for 40 minutes four nights a week.
HER ADVICE
"Consider this if you're in the 30-40 BMI range and have been through the normal diet and exercise route . It's perfect for people who don't want surgery or who are not "big enough" for bariatric surgery." (Although approved by the FDA, this program is not yet covered by all health insurance policies.)

Abstract: Kopf's son, Kevin, 17, along with about a dozen volunteer firefighters from Baldwin Fire Department's Ladder 2 Company, are expected to attend the award presentation ceremony in Albany at The Desmond Hotel.

Full text:   Baldwin Fire Department volunteer firefighter Fred Kopf has been named the 2016 Firefighter of the Year by the Firemen's Association of the State of New York and will be recognized in an award ceremony in Albany on Saturday.
Kopf, a former department captain, was honored for his heroism during a July 4, 2015, apartment house fire in Baldwin. He performed a search and rescue and then carried a 56-year-old man suffering from severe smoke inhalation out of a rear bedroom.
"It gives me great pleasure to present FASNY's 2016 Firefighter of the Year to Fred Kopf for demonstrating outstanding heroism and risking his own life to save another," said FASNY president Robert McConville, head of the group that represents more than 110,000 volunteer firefighters statewide.
Kopf, 48, is a 29-year-veteran of the Baldwin Fire Department assigned to Hook and Ladder Company 2. He is also an 18-year career firefighter with the New York City Fire Department, holding the rank of lieutenant for the past 11 years assigned to Engine Company 311 in South Queens.
"It is a big honor to be recognized," Kopf said Friday as he traveled to Albany. "It is unbelievable and it is very humbling."
Baldwin Fire Department's then-chief, Karen Bendel, who was the first to arrive on the scene of the "uncontrolled fire," had nominated Kopf for the honor.
Bendel noted, "Kopf arrived in his personal vehicle . . . and conducted a search. Kopf located a 56-year-old male in the fire apartment and successfully removed him with assistance to awaiting EMS personnel outside."
Former Capt. Frederick Dirmeir, with the Baldwin Ladder Company 2 recommended Kopf as well, saying that "he negotiated the . . . apartment in zero visibility, blistering heat and without the benefit of a partner to carry out this successful rescue.
"Due to the imminent life threat to the victim he knowingly passed the fire room without the protection of a hand line, in a rapidly deteriorating environment," he said. "Kopf acted in the highest traditions of the Fire Service and without regard to his own personal safety."
Kopf recalled learning from police that someone was trapped inside.
"I went up there and there was another fireman at the top of the stairs and I said, 'I am going to go past the fire, if you can't control this you have to let me know.' I went through and found the guy," Kopf said.
He carried him out of the room and then handed him off to three other firefighters, Tom Ryley, from Ladder 2, Joe Gerdino, formerly with Baldwin Ladder 2, and Ed Moore, from Baldwin Truck 1.
Despite Kopf's heroic action, the man died two days later.
Kopf will also receive Baldwin Fire Department's Distinguished Service Award at the department's headquarters later this year.
Kopf's son, Kevin, 17, along with about a dozen volunteer firefighters from Baldwin Fire Department's Ladder 2 Company, are expected to attend the award presentation ceremony in Albany at The Desmond Hotel.

Alec Baldwin backs East Hampton water-improvement plan

Author: Irizarry, Lisa

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 Aug 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1809567859?accountid=37869

Abstract: Baldwin, who owns a vacation home in Amagansett, made a surprise appearance Thursday at a public hearing of the town board, which focused on a proposed law that would extend the fund's 2 percent real estate transfer tax by two decades, to the year 2050, and allow 20 percent to be used for water-quality protection projects.

Full text:   Actor Alec Baldwin is among a group of several dozen environmentalists and East Hampton residents who have voiced early support for a plan to improve water quality by funding the effort with money from the Community Preservation Fund.
Baldwin, who owns a vacation home in Amagansett, made a surprise appearance Thursday at a public hearing of the town board, which focused on a proposed law that would extend the fund's 2 percent real estate transfer tax by two decades, to the year 2050, and allow 20 percent to be used for water-quality protection projects.
Improvements to wastewater treatment, habitat restoration and pollution control, prevention and abatement are included in the proposal.
In an interview last week before the public hearing, Town Supervisor Larry Cantwell said that if the law is approved in a November referendum, about $25 million could be generated annually over the next 33 years. The Preservation Fund is targeted for land preservation, and Cantwell said more than $600 million would be left for that purpose.
Money for the fund is derived from sales in the five East End Towns - East Hampton, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold. Cantwell said that since its inception in 1998, the fund has generated about $300 million for East Hampton and has helped the town preserve more than 3,000 acres of land. He noted that it has provided about $1 billion for preservation projects on the East End.
"I thank you for your forward thoughts," Amagansett resident Rona Klopman said in complimenting the board on the proposal.
Baldwin, 58, indicated he generally backs the plan but wants more detail.
"Everyone seems to indicate they have great support for the idea and concept," Baldwin told the board, noting that he had met with Councilwoman Sylvia Overby and East Hampton Natural Resources director Kim Shaw about the proposal.
He said he would like another public hearing to be held to explain more about the plan, such as "where the money would be spent and where we could learn the details."
Baldwin added he would like to see a pilot program implemented and its success measured before any water quality plan takes effect.
In an interview Friday, Overby said Baldwin wanted to discuss the water improvement plan because he is very concerned about and active in local environmental issues.
"He's a really private guy, but so generous on the East End," Overby said. "He's been involved with East Hampton's Catholic church, the day care center . . . he's done a lot of things for people in East Hampton."
Baldwin has also been involved in efforts to restore the Amagansett Life-Saving and Coast Guard Station, for which a fundraiser was held last month.
Overby said Baldwin bought a full-page ad in a local newspaper encouraging residents to attend the public hearing.
"He's interested in the environment and keeping things clean and safe," Overby said. "He wants to make sure the CPF survives and continues."

The basics A four-bedroom, two-bath expanded Cape on a 68x90-foot lot
The competition A four-bedroom, two-bath Cape on Berkeley Avenue is listed for $419,000.
Recent sale in the area A three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath Tudor on Harte Street sold Feb. 23 for $449,525.

Listing agent Marilyn Sandroni, Baldwin Realty, Oceanside, 516-678-4980
Why it's for sale Mary Koch, 70, a librarian and family therapist, says her house is too big for one person.
Koch's stone-front Cape has a classic look. She says about the property:
"It's perfect for an older couple who wants to age in place, or a young family. The elementary school is nearby, and kids can walk to it. My mother, when she couldn't be alone anymore, paid to have our attached garage converted to a large bedroom with a half-bath. It's a playroom now for my grandchildren. There are hardwood floors throughout and the walls are plaster. There are a lot of built-in shelves. The dining room is large and easily seats 10 people. There's a wood-burning fireplace in the living room. The yard is extensively landscaped. We don't have grass in the front, just ground cover, trees and roses. It's very distinct and totally organic. The backyard has lilacs, hydrangeas, forsythias, blueberries and daylilies. It will be a delight for anyone who loves being surrounded by flowers and trees. And it's very walkable. You're never more than a few minutes away from a quart of milk. We're a 10-minute walk to the Baldwin train station."

Baldwin High School students paint murals for area hospice

Author: Williams, Bailey

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 June 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1798985153?accountid=37869

Abstract: The mural project began in late April after the students finished their AP art curriculum, their art teacher Michelle Liemer-Kelly said.

Full text:   Liam Archibald, a graduating senior at Baldwin High School, usually can finish a painting in a few hours. But he spent more time on a recent mural when he learned it would hang in the hospice unit of a local hospital.
"I'm just glad that they'll get to see something I made," Archibald said, referring to the terminally ill patients for which the mural, which depicted a path toward a gray mountain, was painted. "I hope that it will touch them somehow."
The murals, the work of nine Baldwin High School advanced placement art students, were unveiled Tuesday at the hospice unit of Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital, where they will be on display permanently. The "Calming Murals," which are all landscapes, are intended to foster serenity during patients' and families' journey through hospice.
Students, parents, nurses and faculty joined school and hospital officials for the unveiling ceremony celebrating the work.
The murals were part of a developing collaboration between the high school and the hospital, and part of an effort to integrate the hospital with its surrounding community, said Stephen Bello, incoming executive director of the hospital.
Barbara Walsh, the nurse manager in the hospice unit, called the paintings "perfect" for that part of the hospital.
"For the families at the end of life, when they're dealing with the loss of a loved one, to see that somebody has taken the time and wanted this journey to be easier just gives them peace," Walsh said.
The mural project began in late April after the students finished their AP art curriculum, their art teacher Michelle Liemer-Kelly said. This was the first time the art department partnered with the hospital, though AP art students often complete a community project at the end of the school year, she said.
Creating murals for terminally ill patients allowed the students, who are also art honor society members, to learn about hospice care. As they learned more about end-of-life care, Liemer-Kelly said more students were inspired to participate.
"They do a lot at the end of the year, so for them to take time and come and do this is special," she said.

Author: Ramos, Victor Manuel

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]09 June 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794726962?accountid=37869

Abstract: Baldwin High's 2014-15 school report card from the state Education Department shows it scored a 94 percent graduation rate, well above the state's 80 percent standard, with 91 percent of its high school graduates enrolling in two- or four-year colleges.

Full text:   Baldwin school officials held a "meet-and-greet" session behind closed doors Wednesday night with parents and a new high school principal who opponents have said is not a good fit for the district.
Dozens of residents were ushered into the Baldwin Middle School library by school officials in a gathering closed to the media and scheduled an hour before the public school board meeting.
As of Wednesday night, an online petition opposing the hiring of Caterina Lafergola as principal of Baldwin High School had generated about 500 signatures.
The petition questions Lafergola's track record as principal of Automotive High School in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. That high school puts particular emphasis on career and technical training.
Lafergola is expected to replace principal Susan Knors, whose retirement was announced at a March 9 board meeting.
Critics of the board hiring Lafergola also signed on to a letter asking Superintendent Shari Camhi, school board president Karyn Reid, and vice president Joel Press "to reconsider and duly reverse this high-impact personnel decision," which they said came as a surprise to the community.
"A high school principal is the leader of the teachers, who are going to get our kids to college. That will be the person who will inspire and guide our teachers," said Shani Bruno, 42, a Baldwin resident, parent and community college professor who created the petition. "I want them to revoke, rescind, block this appointment. I want them to appoint an interim while they reopen the search for an appropriate, competent, qualified applicant or hire."
The opponents said Lafergola's tenure as principal of a vocational school with mostly male students doesn't make her a desirable candidate for Baldwin High, where they said the goal should be to prepare students for college.
Lafergola could not be reached for comment.
Camhi said during a break in Wednesday's meeting that questions about Lafergola's hiring were based on misinformation.
"We've heard from many members of our community and that is not the widespread sentiment," Camhi said. "We used a very thorough and inclusive vetting process."
On the district's Facebook page, Camhi said earlier that Lafergola was hired after a search that started in the winter and included staff and community input.
"The process used to select the principal was thorough and inclusive," Camhi wrote. "Every indication I have is that we have made a good choice for principal, who was unanimously approved by our Board of Education. Ms. Lafergola has an outstanding vision for education, which parallels the work that has successfully taken place over the past two years. She has the capacity, the will and desire to make it happen."
Several residents who attended the meeting spoke during a public comment session, inquiring about Lafergola's qualifications while chiding the board for what they considered a lack of transparency.
"Where was the openness of the process?" asked Barbara Ghyll.
But attorney Chris Venator, representing the school district, repeatedly told speakers the board couldn't discuss personnel decisions in public.
Matt Salmon, a Farmingdale resident and physical education teacher at Automotive High School, told residents he spoke from experience in saying that Lafergola "is the best principal I have ever worked with" and "the most attentive" person with students and staff.
The New York City Department of Education's school quality snapshot for the 2014-15 school year shows Automotive High School, which had 383 students enrolled, achieved a 46 percent graduation rate, with 26 percent of those students going on to college within six months.
Baldwin High's 2014-15 school report card from the state Education Department shows it scored a 94 percent graduation rate, well above the state's 80 percent standard, with 91 percent of its high school graduates enrolling in two- or four-year colleges. Baldwin High School's enrollment was at 1,636 students that school year.
"Our shared contention is that Baldwin deserves a building leader who is more than a manager or disciplinarian, something Automotive High School perhaps truly needed," the petition reads. "The data shows, however . . . that Baldwin High School is a distinctly dissimilar learning community, and is thereby entitled to leadership in possession of rigorous academic demand, high expectations of performance, promotion, graduation, and pursuit of postsecondary study as well as behavior."
Parents who emerged from the meet-and-greet session had mixed reactions, with some saying they were keeping an open mind and others questioning the principal's qualifications.
"I feel that she's confident and seems very experienced, and I feel everyone deserves a fair shake," said Kim Taylor, the vice president of legislation for the Baldwin High PTSA and the mother of a 9th grader at the school.
Taylor said the way Lafergola handled questions from parents impressed her.
But Jacqueline Nicholas, a nurse practitioner who has three children in the district, said the meeting with Lafergola did nothing to soothe her concerns about the new principal's history and qualifications.
"We parents are very upset that this principal was even in the pool" of candidates, Nicholas said. "She doesn't have the experience to be here."

Abstract: Nassau County police are trying to determine whether the same two masked men are responsible for armed robberies late Thursday of a Baldwin delicatessen and a Lakeview takeout restaurant.

Full text:   Nassau County police are trying to determine whether the same two masked men are responsible for armed robberies late Thursday of a Baldwin delicatessen and a Lakeview takeout restaurant.
A department spokesman Friday morning said police think the two, about an hour apart, could be related.
No one was injured in either robbery, police said.
The suspects made off with unspecified amounts of cash in each robbery, plus a laptop computer from the deli.
Detectives said employees of the United Deli, at 590 W. Seaman Ave. in Baldwin, were closing at 9:19 p.m. when the two suspects forced them back inside the building.
One of the suspects, who had a black handgun, demanded that a male employee, 23, open the cash register, police said.
The employee complied and placed the cash and a laptop in the suspect's backpack; both suspects then ran off south on Pine Street, police said.
The other employees were a man, 19, and two women, ages 32 and 25, police said.
At about 10:32 p.m., two men "with their faces covered" also robbed the Lees Garden Takeout, at 1015 Woodfield Rd.
One suspect, armed with a silver handgun, climbed over the counter and demanded cash, police said. An employee, a man, 36, opened the register and the suspect took an unspecified amount of cash.
Police said the two suspects then drove off south on Woodfield Road in a black Honda Civic.
Another employee, a man, 48, also was in the building at the time of the robbery.
In the Baldwin robbery, both masked men were described as in their mid 20s and wearing dark hooded sweatshirts and gloves, police said. One suspect also wore pink striped pants and had a blue backpack.
In the Lakeview robbery, one suspect wore a red hooded sweatshirt, dark pants and black sneakers, the other a dark hooded sweatshirt.
Anyone with more information can call Crime Stoppers at 800-244-8477. All information will be kept confidential.

Disbarred Baldwin attorney Janice Jessup gets to 3 to 9 years

Author: Murphy, Bridget

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 Apr 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779340960?accountid=37869

Abstract: The judge also responded to a complaint Thursday about Jessup allegedly getting poor medical care at Nassau's jail while suffering from conditions including diabetes and coronary artery disease.

Full text:   A disbarred lawyer who stole more than $1 million from vulnerable former clients brought shame upon herself and the legal profession, a Nassau judge said Thursday while sentencing her to prison.
Janice Jessup, 68, of Baldwin and Charlotte, North Carolina, got 3 to 9 years behind bars for schemes authorities said involved stealing from an elderly woman and a woman with multiple sclerosis.
"You say you're not a bad person, but you are a thief," acting State Supreme Court Justice Jerald Carter told Jessup in Nassau County Court.
Prosecutors said Jessup spent the money on herself and her family, including buying a vintage Corvette and supporting the limo business of the man she was married to at the time.
Assistant District Attorney Brian Heid told the judge Jessup's crimes "struck at the heart of the judicial system."
As part of a January plea bargain, Jessup had admitted to ripping off more than $1.1 million from a disabled woman who'd owned land that the government seized in an eminent domain case and used for a New Cassel community center.
That crime between 2008 and 2010 involved an impostor, working with Jessup, who posed as the victim to fool a court official during home visits aimed at investigating the victim's health and whether she'd consent to the money's release to Jessup.
The district attorney's office identified the impostor Thursday as the victim's sister - the same person who brought the initial complaint against Jessup - but wouldn't say if that woman would face prosecution.
Jessup also previously took responsibility for getting a power of attorney document "purportedly bearing the signature" of a reverse mortgage client, before stealing about $84,000 in 2012 from the woman - who was in a nursing home.
Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a prepared statement that Jessup "intentionally targeted vulnerable people" and will now be punished with "a lengthy prison sentence."
Separately, Jessup lost her law license in 2010 after facing more than a dozen professional misconduct allegations.
While ordering Jessup to pay back what she stole, Carter said Thursday he knew she couldn't do so and added that "remorse without any restitution is hollow."
Jessup's attorney, James Pascarella, said the defendant had expressed great remorse, lived most of her life as a good person, and was in an abusive marriage when she took the money.
But the judge later addressed the lawyer's reference to Jessup's lack of a criminal record by saying John Wilkes Booth didn't have a record either before he assassinated President Abraham Lincoln.
"That did not make him any less culpable," Carter said.
The judge also responded to a complaint Thursday about Jessup allegedly getting poor medical care at Nassau's jail while suffering from conditions including diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Carter lowered Jessup's bail after her April 2015 arrest - allowing her to get out of jail - after she reported not getting medication for several days despite his instructions. Her attorney asked for her transfer to state prison to be expedited due to health concerns.
"One thing that you can be sure of . . . If they're treating you that badly and they're not doing what they're supposed to do, the situation changes radically upstate," Carter said Thursday.

Baldwin volleyball coach Luis Sepulveda to also guide Pratt

Author: DeJohn, Kenny

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]29 Mar 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1776260572?accountid=37869

Abstract: The Baldwin girls volleyball coach has been hired as Pratt Institute's women's volleyball coach, according to a news release from the school, but also said he plans to stay in his current role with the Bruins.

Full text:   Luis Sepulveda is going to be a busy man.
The Baldwin girls volleyball coach has been hired as Pratt Institute's women's volleyball coach, according to a news release from the school, but also said he plans to stay in his current role with the Bruins.
"I've built that program," Sepulveda said. "I want to see it through all the way."
Sepulveda has led Baldwin to a 24-8 record in two seasons and spent three seasons at Island Trees. He was also an assistant coach at Nassau Community College.
"We are thrilled to add Luis to our coaching staff. We look forward to him, his experiences and his personality leading our program," Cannoneers athletic director Walter Rickard said in the news release.
Pratt, which is in Brooklyn, is roughly a 45-minute drive from Baldwin High School. The seasons overlap, meaning Sepulveda, who is married with a 3-year-old son, will have to get creative with his scheduling.
While he admitted coaching both programs simultaneously would be a challenge, he believes it will work.
"When I do something, I'm either going to do it or I'm not," he said. "It's black or white; there are no shades of gray with me."
Allie Ahearne was Sepulveda's captain at Baldwin this season, and the senior said that she and her teammates initially thought he wouldn't coach at Baldwin any longer.
But after they learned that he plans to stay, they offered praise and support.
"They're getting a great coach, on the court and off the court," Ahearne said. "They're lucky to have him."
The decision process for Sepulveda wasn't easy, even though he said being a head coach at the collegiate level is something he's wanted to do since he was young.
The Cannoneers play in the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and went 7-14 last season. Turning around the program wouldn't be a first for Sepulveda, as he inherited a 2-10 Island Trees team and proceeded to go 24-18 before coaching Baldwin.
"I know what's needed to be successful," he said. "It's just a new challenge."

Abstract: Wayne Bruyn, a Southampton attorney representing the developer, said The Hills proposal is preferable to the 82 single-family homes that could be built on the site without special approval from the town board, which he said would have a much larger impact on East Quogue's school.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Alec Baldwin has added his voice to an environmental campaign against a planned golf resort in East Quogue.
The actor, a Massapequa native, has recorded a 2-minute television commercial opposing The Hills at Southampton project, which environmental advocates say would develop the largest privately owned property in the state-protected Long Island Pine Barrens.
Discovery Land Co., based in Arizona, wants to build 118 residences designed as secondary homes for affluent buyers and a 98-acre golf course with a 155,760-square-foot clubhouse.
The project would develop part of a wooded 594-acre site off Sunrise Highway and requires special permission from the Southampton Town Board.
Citing concerns about water contamination, Baldwin calls the proposal "the biggest and baddest development on Long Island" in a commercial he recorded on behalf of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, an environmental group.
"Join us by telling your elected officials to kill The Hills," he urges viewers in the TV spot.
The commercial is scheduled to run on more than a dozen channels that reach eastern Long Island, according to a news release from the Long Island Pine Barrens Society.
Baldwin, who owns a house in Amagansett, has been a prominent donor and spokesman for East End environmental causes.
His commercial also criticizes a Southampton Town law that allows a supermajority of town board members to bypass zoning rules to greenlight projects they deem beneficial to the community. Discovery Land Co. is seeking approval for The Hills under that provision, known as the Planned Development District, or PDD, law.
Baldwin says such developments are "nothing more than density giveaways to wealthy developers" that "compromise water quality, increase traffic and raise taxes to pay for increased government services required by the new development."
Southampton Town officials said in a statement that they "appreciate Mr. Baldwin's interest in the Southampton community" and are conducting an environmental review of The Hills.
"All of the concerns referenced by Mr. Baldwin are part of the review," the statement said, adding that an "extensive public hearing process" would follow.
Wayne Bruyn, a Southampton attorney representing the developer, said The Hills proposal is preferable to the 82 single-family homes that could be built on the site without special approval from the town board, which he said would have a much larger impact on East Quogue's school.
"It's not about no development versus development," Bruyn said. "It's clearly a choice of what form of development you want." He declined to comment on Baldwin's commercial.

Shane Gatling scores 23 as Baldwin beats Deer Park

Author: Herzog, Bob

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Jan 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1755542889?accountid=37869

Abstract: Baldwin outscored Deer Park 16-4 in the second quarter to build a 30-22 halftime lead and made it a 13-0 run by scoring the first six points of the third quarter, including a lefty reverse layup in transition by Gatling and a step-back jumper after a steal by Rhoden.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Shane Gatling had a little extra on his mind Sunday.
"I played poorly the last couple of games and I wanted to show people I'm one of the best players on Long Island," the Baldwin senior guard said.
The perfect attention-getter was his opponent - Deer Park junior guard Darien Jenkins. The two were matched up often and both excelled with 23-point performances. But Gatling had the better surrounding cast in a matchup of Class AA powers and Baldwin pulled away for a 68-52 victory in the first Tip of the Hat Hoops Classic at Adelphi.
"I had to bounce back for my teammates," Gatling said. "I know that Jenkins is one of the best players in Suffolk, and that helped me focus."
He and junior Jared Rhoden, who scored 18 points, helped Baldwin improve to 7-2.
Deer Park (5-3) shot well in the first quarter in building an 18-14 lead, but that served as a wake-up call for the Bruins' pressure defense.
"We were sleeping in that first quarter," Baldwin coach Darius Burton said. "In the second quarter, we finally played the kind of defense we're capable of and held them to four points. We tried to wear them down with pressure and they didn't get the same shots they got in the first quarter."
Baldwin outscored Deer Park 16-4 in the second quarter to build a 30-22 halftime lead and made it a 13-0 run by scoring the first six points of the third quarter, including a lefty reverse layup in transition by Gatling and a step-back jumper after a steal by Rhoden. The Bruins closed the third quarter on a 12-0 burst to take a 50-31 lead.
Gatling kept the ball moving as point guard Jabeon Bivins (five points) and Rhoden (four) contributed to that blitz. The Bruins' defense also was strong in the third quarter. "We found out their weakness and kept after them," Gatling said.
Baldwin forced Jenkins to pass the ball. "If he doesn't have the ball," Gatling said, "we're a better defensive team."
Jenkins had one long three-pointer in the third quarter, but that was it. He got hot in the fourth, with two more threes and 11 points, but the Falcons never got closer than the final 16-point margin, partially because Jenkins didn't have a sidekick as talented as Rhoden.
"He's one of the top juniors on Long Island," Burton said. "He worked tremendously hard in the offseason. He can shoot it and he can put the ball on the floor. He creates matchup problems for other guys at the '3' spot."
Gatling has expanded his game, too, showing off his slashing ability on several hard drives through traffic. "I worked on getting to the basket. Everybody thinks of me as just a shooter. But I can create for my teammates," he said. "I'm not just a shooter."
That's just another point for Gatling to prove.

Hills West beats Holy Trinity at Baldwin Holiday Tournament

Author: Kramer, Ari

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]29 Dec 2015.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1752156295?accountid=37869

Abstract: The Colts (4-0) rode Dalyrimple to a 16-2 lead with 1:23 left in the first quarter, but Holy Trinity (4-2) extended its pressure and cut the gap to 31-26 at halftime.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Kian Dalyrimple sprained his right thumb blocking a shot off the backboard a few weeks ago. He has played with his shooting hand taped ever since.
That has hardly altered his stroke, which he had on display as Half Hollow Hills West defeated Holy Trinity, 60-57, Monday in the first round of Baldwin's Holiday Tournament.
The Colts (4-0) will face Baldwin Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the championship.
Dalyrimple scored a game-high 23 points. He was 5-for-9 on three-point attempts. Richard Altenord (13 points, seven rebounds and two blocks) scored the Colts' last four points to finish what Dalyrimple started.
"It's all about heart," Altenord said. "We stayed strong and pulled out the W."
Dalyrimple, a 6-5 guard, said he developed his shot trying to emulate the NBA's best. He has striven to rise like Michael Jordan, elevate his release like LeBron James and flick quickly like Stephen Curry.
"I used to just watch NBA players, and I would go outside and do what they did," Dalyrimple said.
The fruits of his hard work were evident Monday, particularly in the first quarter. His high release helped him hit a tough three for the game's first basket. Then he rose and adjusted in the air, doing his Jordan impression, to bank a two-pointer, and he knocked down two more three-pointers off the dribble, beating his defender with a quick release.
"He's a natural scorer," said coach Bill Mitaritonna, who earned his 200th win. "He's got that gene. He just gets us going."
The Colts (4-0) rode Dalyrimple to a 16-2 lead with 1:23 left in the first quarter, but Holy Trinity (4-2) extended its pressure and cut the gap to 31-26 at halftime. The Titans began the second half on an 8-0 run, capped on a layup by Thornton Scott (13 points).
Holy Trinity would not lead for long.
Dalyrimple (four steals) intercepted a pass and fed Altenord for a layup before getting a layup of his own to wrest away the lead for good one minute later. Those two plays sparked a 14-5 run that put the Colts up, 45-39, to finish the quarter.
"I said, 'Holy Trinity gave us a knockout punch and we're up six,' " Mitaritonna said, describing his pre-fourth quarter huddle. "I said that's a good sign of character and a sign that we can face adversity. This was a great test for us tonight."
