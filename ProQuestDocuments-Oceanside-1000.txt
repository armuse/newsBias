Full text: Debbie Rifenbury survived a harrowing bout with COVID-19 in April that included 17 days in the hospital and six days on a ventilator.
But the Oceanside woman has yet to completely beat the disease, which left her with a series of health problems, including persistent cough and fatigue, as well as an unstable heart rate and blood pressure.
"I used to be a powerhouse," Rifenbury, 61, said. "Now I'm weak as a kitten. They said it's going to take time ... I pray to God it comes sooner than later. It's rough."
Medical experts are still trying to understand the long-term impact of COVID-19 on patients who have recovered from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The spectrum of illness among patients is broad and complex. Some were able to stay home and battle the virus. Others needed hospital care. Many seem to have fully recovered, but doctors are seeing patients released from the hospital continue to grapple with breathing issues, crippling exhaustion and worse.
Doctors continue to gather information on the virus as they treat new patients and plan for a possible second wave of the pandemic.
"During the height of the crisis, I had a whole research team collecting data samples," said Dr. Thomas McGinn, deputy physician-in-chief at Northwell Health and director at The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset.
"It was kind of like cooking in your kitchen while it was on fire," he said. "But we did it. I'm very proud of my team."
A lingering fatigue
McGinn said every case is unique, but about 80% of people with COVID-19 never went to the hospital and about half of that number had mild forms of the disease and are fine.
Even some people who were not admitted to the hospital had a "pretty significant battle" with the virus.
"A lot of those people end up having issues around lingering fatigue and weakness because they were home in bed for a long time," McGinn said. "We are doing a lot of rehab with those people and getting them physically fit again."
That's how Jackie Sanchez, a model and makeup artist from Roosevelt, said she felt - even after testing negative for the virus weeks after she first felt ill. She said her doctor believes she had it in March.
"It took me a solid two months to break out of the tiredness," Sanchez, 54, said. "I was in a deep exhaustion."
Eve Dorfman, vice president of Home Healthcare at NYU Winthrop Hospital, said many of their patients are feeling "completely wiped out" and receiving physical therapy at home.
"It's taking longer than it would take for a regular medical patient to get their strength back," she said. "They are walking 10 feet six weeks later and they are still short of breath."
Karla Duarte, a 16-year-old who beat COVID-19 in April, said she was thrilled to be able to ride her bike the other day. Despite a difficult hospital stay, she finished her work to complete 11th grade.
"I'm feeling much better ... like I am coming back now 100%," she said from her Queens Village home. "I'm at physical therapy two times a week. I'm able to walk a little faster."
Vascular issues
One of the biggest complications doctors are seeing is the prevalence of vascular issues associated with COVID-19, said Dr. Anthony P. Ardito, vice president of the primary care service line at Catholic Health Services of Long Island. Those issues include blood clots in the lungs and kidney problems.
"A small number of patients are coming back after being discharged with strokes, pulmonary embolism, blood clots in their legs, persistent renal complications," he said. "COVID clearly causes an inflammatory response in the body, which is what eventually causes most of the lung damage and kidney issues."
Ardito said that is why many patients were placed on blood thinners for several weeks after they were discharged from the hospital.
"The vascular complications are much higher in those patients who were in the intensive care unit for a prolonged period of time," Ardito said. "But the risk is pretty much for anyone who has had COVID."
Anxiety and depression
Isolation during the pandemic has been especially difficult for some COVID-19 patients, experts said. Coupling that with the stress and anxiety of being sick has left many patients depressed.
"I think the world is feeling pretty strange right now with the isolation and lack of human contact," Dorfman said. "We do our best to make them feel like they are not alone."
Ardito said calls to mental health hotlines from people seeking help have soared.
Rifenbury said she has started speaking with a counselor and encouraged other recovering patients to seek help.
That fact that the number of COVID-19 cases in New York has declined in recent weeks should not give people a false sense of security, she said.
"It's great that everything is opening again, but don't think everything is hunky-dory, because it's not," she said. "Thank God I am here today."

More testimony disclosed in stabbing case

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A prosecutor Thursday disclosed grand jury testimony about the deadly stabbing of an Oceanside High School student to attorneys for the teenager facing a murder charge in the case, according to the defense.
Tyler Flach, 19, of Lido Beach, didn't appear in Nassau County Court as his lawyers and a prosecutor conferred with acting state Supreme Court Howard Sturim during a conference that didn't include any public proceedings.
"Lots of witnesses testified before the grand jury and gave statements and we're looking forward to seeing what these witnesses have to say," defense attorney Edward Sapone said after court.
Prosecutor Ania Pulaski gave the defense a CD containing grand jury testimony during the conference, he said.
The Nassau district attorney's office declined to comment Thursday.
Flach previously pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging him with murder, gang assault, assault and weapon offenses after the death of Khaseen Morris, 16, following an after-school fight at an Oceanside strip mall.
Law enforcement officials have alleged Flach stabbed Morris once in the heart in the Sept. 16 brawl that began after Flach and a group of his friends charged at Morris and his friends.
Flach, who had attended Nassau Community College, remains jailed without bail while awaiting trial.
Police have said the stabbing happened after Morris went to the Brower Avenue location knowing the ex-boyfriend of a girl he'd befriended wanted to confront him.
Morris' family has said he had texted the ex-boyfriend to say he wasn't dating the girl, but walked her home from a party.
Sapone also said Thursday he believed the Nassau district attorney's office withheld grand jury testimony from one witness. He added that negotiations are taking place about whether the prosecution possibly could disclose that evidence under an agreement whereby the defense would keep that person's identity confidential.
Joined Thursday by fellow Flach attorney William Petrillo, Sapone said the defense gave "a massive hard drive" to the prosecution so more evidence could be stored and handed over in the future.
The proceeding seemed to mirror a conference a day earlier before the same judge. At that time, attorneys for some of the Long Beach teenagers facing felony gang assault charges in the same case also said grand jury testimony had been disclosed.
Sapone said the defense waived Flach's appearance Thursday, when major developments weren't expected, in part to avoid "a courtroom spectacle with ... lots of lights and cameras."
The defense was "gearing up for trial," Sapone said, adding: "We have a team of investigators, forensic folks, support staff working day and night, preparing and building a defense for Mr. Flach."
He said the teenager is "entirely confident that the case will be resolved ... in his favor, which is the right way."
Several members of the victim's family waited in a court hallway before speaking to Pulaski after the bench conference.
"We didn't even go inside because they just handed over the same thing," said Khaseen's sister, Keyanna Morris, 30, referencing Wednesday's conference.
She said her family would return to court in February for the next proceedings and until then would continue to cope with "life without our brother."

SURGE IN CASES AT HOSPITALS SLOWED: NEW CONFIRMED POSITIVES HAVE FALLEN OVER PAST TWO WEEKS

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]25 Apr 2020: 2.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This story was reported by Mark Harrington, Sandra Peddie and Matt Clark. It was written by Peddie.
The surge of coronavirus patients that inundated Long Island hospitals slowed over the past two weeks, providing a measure of relief to medical institutions operating on a war footing.
In both Nassau and Suffolk counties, the number of new COVID-19 cases confirmed each day - one measure of the pressure on hospitals - has fallen from peaks around the end of the first week in April.
On April 7, the counties recorded an islandwide total of 3,265 new confirmed cases. On April 22, the number was 1,282, a 61% decline after dropping even lower two days earlier.
Similarly, the Island's medical centers have experienced falling numbers of hospitalized patients, intensive-care unit admissions and the use of ventilators to support breathing.
"We have clearly crested and may be on a downward slope," said Dr. David Battinelli, Northwell Health's chief medical officer and senior vice president. But, he cautioned, "The numbers are still very, very high."
Gov. Andew M. Cuomo said on Friday that health authorities will monitor evidence that stay-at-home orders and social distancing have produced falling infection rates in determining when to begin reopening the economy. He said the authorities will watch for two straight weeks of stabilized or declining rates.
At the same time, coronavirus caseloads in hospitals have yet to fall far enough for the hospitals to avoid crises in the event of a sudden surge in new cases, let alone to resume activities like elective surgeries.
"We don't even know what normal will look like," said Carol Gomes, chief executive officer and chief operating officer of Stony Brook University Hospital. "I think our definition of normal will change."
Monitoring the data is key to understanding what's next, according to front-line doctors.
Islandwide coronavirus hospitalizations have declined from a high on April 10 of 4,108 patients to 3,118 on Wednesday, a drop of 24%.
Nassau's hospitalizations peaked on April 13 at 2,477 COVID-19 patients. By Wednesday, the number was down to 1,778. In Suffolk, the caseload dropped from a high on April 10 of 1,658 patients to 1,340 on Wednesday.
Intensive care unit caseloads are also declining from peaks, although not as dramatically.
Across Long Island, the number of ICU patients peaked at 1,154 on April 14 and stood at 990 on Wednesday. Nassau fell from 592 patients to 496, Suffolk from 562 to 494.
The number of patients supported by ventilators has dropped less dramatically: in Nassau from 503 on April 13 to 415 on April 22, and in Suffolk to 411 from 466.
The number of intubated patients had remained comparatively steady because patients are requiring extended assistance breathing, Gomes said.
"Some of them are on vents for several weeks at a time. That's why we're seeing so many patients on vents. It takes a while for them to come off the vents," she said.
Medical officials saw reason for optimism in the numbers but cautioned that the trend line needs to continue and could change as plans to reopen businesses and the larger society take effect.
"It gives people a much-needed break, a respite," said Sean Clouston, associate professor at Stony Brook University's Program in Public Health, who has been studying the virus to model its progression in Suffolk County and for the Stony Brook hospital system.
Clouston cautioned against drawing conclusions until longer trends emerge. He noted that ventilator patient declines were not yet in the double digits.  
Dr. Adhi Sharma, chief medical officer and executive vice president of Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside, said falling coronavirus statistics are encouraging, but noted that coronavirus patient census is still high.
"While there is a decline in the new numbers, the patients don't recover that quickly. There is a stacking phenomenon," he said.
The hospital currently is treating 250 COVID-19 patients, out of 382 beds. "We still have a heavy burden of COVID patients," Sharma said.
The hospital will need "a minimum of two weeks" until some time in early May before it can start getting back to normal operations.
Clouston said the unknown in the numbers is "how much of a downward trend there is when you account for delays in testing" and "incomplete data."
Indeed, the total number of COVID-19 tests in both Nassau and Suffolk has declined.
In Nassau County just 1,980 people were tested for COVID-19 on April 22, down sharply from a peak of 4,179 on April 7, according to the figures.
In Suffolk the figures are similar: just 2,428 tests were done on April 22, down from a high of 3,889 on April 8. It's unclear whether the lower testing numbers are related to lower capacity or fewer people showing up at testing centers.
Battinelli said that people panicked early in the pandemic and rushed to get tested, but that panic has eased.
Testing may also have declined because the criteria to get tested are stringent and there is a shortage of key components, like swabs, said Northwell spokesman Terry Lynam.
Currently, tests are limited to people who are experiencing symptoms and are essential workers, immune-compromised or elderly with underlying medical conditions. "Nobody else is being tested because of the shortage of swabs," he said.
If the problem is capacity, Cuomo on Wednesday has said the state's approximately 300 testing centers have been ordered to double their current capacity from 20,000 COVID-19 tests per day to 40,000. The testing centers are mostly privately operated.
"That's the maximum capacity of all the machines in the state," Cuomo said, likening it to holding down the accelerator on a car and hoping nothing breaks.
Clouston of Stony Brook said the state's plan for more testing will help modelers better understand the virus as the state begins to ponder plans to selectively lift the lockdown order.
Right now, he said, it's "unclear to what extent it [the declines] carries forward into a steady drop or a slower pace of decline." His own modeling suggests the future decline is somewhere between a sharp drop and a slow one. "My model says a couple of hundred cases per day into mid-May."

LIers uniting to help make face shields: Everyone from quilters to teen robotics whiz

Full text: A band of dedicated quilters. A longtime textile designer. A teen robotics whiz.
These Long Islanders are turning their careers and hobbies into ways to help fulfill one goal: to create face masks and shields that protect the most vulnerable, such as hospital employees and the elderly, from coronavirus. The barriers are meant to be worn over surgical masks, as an added layer of safety.
The organizations North Fork Quilters and Long Island Quilts for Kids are among several quilting groups that have become full-time mask-makers during the pandemic. Karen Nicholson is president of the Eastern Long Island Quilters Guild, a large network of crafters and quilt-makers making masks from Garden City to the North Fork, she said. 
Members of the guild have mobilized within their communities to contribute masks throughout their areas. North Fork Quilters is a branch within the guild, and so far they've provided masks for Peconic Landing (a retirement community in Greenport), Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead and Stony Brook Eastern Long Island Hospital.
"I've lost track but with the guild, we've probably made well over 2,000 and donated to different areas," Nicholson said.
Nicholson, of Cutchogue, made her first quilt when she was 16.  She's found a sense of community with her fellow quilters, who've made quilts for chemotherapy patients and children's hospitals.
The masks are made with a piece of cotton and a piece of flannel sewn together, then something to secure the mask around the head - elastic, strips cut out of T-shirts, hair ties or other stretchable fabric.
"We're not medical professionals but we will help where we can, and that's what our guild is all about," Nicholson said.
North Fork Quilters donates masks either through nonprofits, such as Kait's Angels, which makes the deliveries, or finds people in need through their own network, such as family members of quilters who are health care workers.
"A lot of nurses are using our masks when they leave facilities. We understand it's not guaranteed to protect against the virus, but it's preventing other germs being spread," Nicholson said.
Long Island Quilts for Kids has also been hard at work - the volunteers have donated 8,000 kits to make masks and delivered 6,132 completed masks to health care workers around Long Island, according to Carrie Davis, the chapter president.
Mary Ellen Orchard, of Wantagh, collects donations of handmade masks at Eisenhower Park in Westbury twice a week, and also makes her own. "I already had all the fabric," she said, "because I'm a quilter."
Through several Long Island quilting Facebook groups, Orchard spread the word about her mission far and wide. With the help of volunteers, Orchard said she has donated more than 1,300 masks to NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow and St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn. Orchard also sent a special 95-mask shipment for the aging nuns of The Sisters of St. Dominic in Amityville.
"I almost cried because they were so desperate," she said.
Like Nicholson, Orchard also sews together flannel and cotton - 6- by-9-inch pieces, with a one-eighth inch of elastic. They agree that elastic is becoming hard to find due to this Islandwide mission, but Orchard tries to provide some to volunteers when she can find it.
"Everybody can do something," Orchard said. "If you can't sew, cut. If you can't cut, look for elastic."
Cynthia Julia Lagudi, of Oceanside, worked as a textile designer for 12 years before the pandemic. She had taken a break after having children and focused on her company, Cupcake Provocateur, but decided to get back into her trade earlier this year. In fact, she had just placed an order of fabrics and trims right before the need for masks arose.
Julia Lagudi wasn't expecting to use her craft for this cause, but, "I thought it was the perfect opportunity to give back in some small way," she said. "It was a no-brainer."
Julia Lagudi formed a Facebook group called New York Covid-19 Protective Mask Cover Project, which now has more than 500 members. She said they've created and donated masks to hospitals including Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside and Long Island Community Hospital in Patchogue. 
And Ethan Silverstein, a 10th-grader at Syosset High School, is using his 3D printer to create face shields for frontline workers. He had been saving up for "a couple years" for the printer, which at first he was using for a class. Silverstein didn't think he'd be home from school for more than a few weeks, but when he realized the severity of the situation, he got to work.
"After I did some research online, I found some models and some ways to do it, and I was able to start printing," said Silverstein, 15.
Silverstein creates face shields, 285 so far, by cutting plastic into rounded square shapes and using the 3D printer to make the headband to attach on top of it. The way the printer works: "It's similar to a traditional printer, but instead of ink, it's plastic," he said.
An added purpose of the shields, in addition to preventing the spread of germs, is to keep people from touching their faces, Silverstein said. Syosset School District administrators gave him more plastic to help create shields, which he has donated to various offices through the Allied Health System, plus several local hospitals. This endeavor is also a part of an outreach project for his school's robotics team, Syborgs 10696.
"I have a tool here to help solve this issue, or make a dent in it as a local impact,"

Kids' creations: Heart work: Making bracelets for LI grads; cards to nursing homes

Full text: Even though Mia Yap is only 10, lately she's had high school graduation on her mind.
"You do a lot of things when you're graduating," she explained. "You get to live your life, like you get a big, gigantic field trip and you get your prom and your party, you get freedom, you get a giant ceremony where your parents call out your name and you get to walk across a stage."
But this year, the Class of 2020 won't get to experience any of those milestones - at least not in person. So Mia and her sister, Lily, 8, decided to do something special for graduating seniors.
The girls' mother, Leann Yap of Ronkonkoma, is a special education math teacher at Wyandanch Memorial High School. She said a lot of her students were sending her messages, saying how sad they were and that they missed school.
"My children wanted to help cheer them up a little bit, so we tried to come up with some ideas, and we had a lot of beads," Yap said. "So we thought, bracelets!"
Mia and Lily have made 40 bracelets so far. Some of them are made by braiding string - they use the "jellyfish" method, where they cut a piece of cardboard into a circle, tie the string around it and continuously loop it around the circle to create a braid. 
The girls also use beads to make rainbow bracelets, and some with the Wyandanch colors: green, yellow and white. Yap then mails the creations to her students, which also include cards with well-wishes from her daughters.
Yap says she's proud of her daughters, especially because of how much time they've put into this endeavor.
"I know they're 8 and 10, but it does take them a lot of time to put them together; they definitely underestimated the amount of time," she said with a laugh. "Those jellyfish bracelets take about two hours, and the bead ones will take them up to an hour."
Yap held up a bracelet Lily had been working on - a few small, purple beads on a string. "You can see she's been working on this one since this morning."
"Hey, I took a break!" Lily said.
"It takes time for their little fingers to put all the little beads on," her mother added.
The girls agreed that they will continue making bracelets "until this is over." In the meantime, they've been taking "social distancing walks" while wearing masks and doing plenty of homework. The reason their bracelets are important, they said in unison, "After rain, there's always gonna be a rainbow."
In Oceanside, 8-year-old Ava Pepe is echoing that sentiment. She's been making cards, which she and her mother named "Kards of Kindness," for another group of people who may be feeling lonely during the pandemic.
"All of these elderly people, they're all over the country and they don't have family to go visit them right now," she said. "So I was just thinking, why don't we cheer them up with cards?"
Ava draws things like smiley faces, sunshine and butterflies on the front of the card, and inside she writes messages such as: "You are always remembered" and "You are beautiful." Her mother, Stephanie Pepe, drops them off at nursing homes around Long Island. 
The first delivery was in April, to the Beach Terrace Care Center in Long Beach, and Ava has also made cards for Oceanside Care Center, Pepe said. Ava and her mother also print out word searches and puzzles to include in the cards.
Pepe added that Ava will also send her "Kards of Kindness" through the national organization Kids For Peace. The nonprofit started a project called Loving Letters for Grandfriends, where children can send letters to elderly people who can no longer have visitors due to COVID-19.
Pepe said Ava has created about 170 cards as of mid-May.
"I really want to help them out so they won't be lonely," Ava said.
In addition to her written messages of hope, she has one more to give to seniors all over the country: "You're not alone," Ava said. "We're in this together.

Full text: One of Long Island's most effective learning environments is the environment itself.
Many local schools hosted field trips to adjacent bays, lakes and rivers this fall to help students learn first hand about the region's ecosystems and wildlife.
Oyster Bay High School's marine biology students used seine nets to dredge up sea life from the Long Island Sound during a visit to The WaterFront Center, a local nonprofit. The specimens, including eels, minnows and mummichog, are being kept in a tank for the teens to study before they are released back into the water in June. 
"It's so great for the students to come and see for themselves the type of marine life that exists here," Oyster Bay marine biology teacher Jill Sanborn said. "They grow up here and they are in the water all the time."
Massapequa High School's AP environmental science students performed a chemical analysis of a stream alongside a bike trail in the Massapequa Preserve. Tasks included testing pH, dissolved oxygen and salinity levels and comparing the stream's health to other local waterways through Brookhaven National Laboratory.
East Rockaway High School students conducted research - ranging from analyzing water quality to sampling plant pecies - in a salt marsh at the Oceanside Marine Nature Study Area under the guidance of conservation biologist Michael Farina.
Students from Bethpage High School and John F. Kennedy Middle School learned about creatures that live in local waters while sailing aboard a historic oyster sloop called the Christeen.
GREAT NECK
Business Challenge
Great Neck South High School seniors Amal Deochand and Ian Myer won first place in this year's Plainview-Old Bethpage Business Challenge, which attracted about 30 teams from schools across Long Island.
The ninth annual competition challenged teams of two or three students to develop creative business presentations based on an assigned topic using only their knowledge of business and two textbooks.  
The event was organized and hosted by Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK High School's Business Honor Society.

SUPER SLICES: OUR ANNUAL LIST OF LI'S TOP 10 PIZZA PLACES

Full text: Long Island boasts hundreds of great slice joints. This list does not include those pies.
Choosing among them would be a fool's errand: the whole point of a neighborhood pizzeria is that it is in your neighborhood, a dependable source of savory sustenance that's no more than a short drive or a phone call away.  
The pizzerias on this list warrant a trip from anywhere else on the Island. They are going above and beyond with their sourcing of ingredients, with their carefully wrought toppings and, most of all, with their crusts.
A great crust is the sine qua non of great pizza; without it you might as well put the toppings on an English muffin or a flour tortilla. And to fans of wackadoo pizza toppings, I say this: judging a pie based on its toppings is like picking a Miss America based on her swimsuit.
Of the 10 pies on our original 2012 list, only one remains. But it's a doozy, and has once again snared the top spot. Of the pizzerias that have fallen off the list, some have closed (Brunetti in Westhampton Beach is supposed to reopen in a new location in the spring) and some have let their standards slip
But the big news for 2019 is the number of newcomers on the list: four out of 10. Pizza Rita is bringing classic Neapolitan pies to Mattituck, Donatina in Patchogue makes Neapolitan pies as well as Detroit and classic New York pies. I've never put slices on this list before but I had to change the rules when confronted with the squares at Taglio in Mineola and King Umberto's in Elmont.
Two more things to bear in mind: No pizzeria got onto this list if the quality of all the pies wasn't very high. You can never go wrong ordering a Margherita or marinara at any of them.
Finally, this is a very close competition. In the middle of the list, the distance between rankings is barely greater than the thickness of a slice of pepperoni.
Let the debates begin.
1. Sausage pie at Salvatore's
124 Shore Rd., Port Washington, 516-883-8457, salvatorescoalovenpizzeria.com
Here's the one to beat, the pie that's been ranked number one more times than any other, the sausage pie at Salvatore's. Only a coal-burning oven can make an eight-slice pie with this soulful combination of char and creaminess and Salvatore's, which opened in 1996, was the first Long Island pizzeria to use the method pioneered by New York's very first pizzerias, Lombardi's, John's, Totonno's and Patsy's (from which Salvatore's is descended). The pizzaioli here use an unorthodox technique for stretching the dough - rolling pins instead of hand-spinning - but what comes out of the 900-degree oven is the classic New York coal-fired pie. The crust is a dream, crisp but pliant, the topping is a balanced meld of fresh, milky mozzarella and chunky chopped tomatoes punctuated with little nubbins of crumbled sausage. In 2017, ownership of Salvatore's passed from founder Fred Lacagnina to brothers Pat and Dom DeSimone, with no discernible change. A large pie is $25.45; why anyone would go for the smaller size, $23.45, is beyond me. 
2. The DOC at Naples Street Food
970 Hempstead Tpke., Franklin Square, 516-673-4630
2905 Long Beach Rd., Oceanside, 516-442-1692
Naples Street Food's pie is unapologetically Neapolitan. It is bordered by a puffy rim ("cornicione" in Italian) whose texture - pillowy but chewy - is the result of a long, cold fermentation and superfine "tipo 00" flour. Since 2016, when he opened his tiny pizzeria in Franklin Square, Naples-born pizzaiolo Gianluca Chiarolanza has tightened up his pies, making the crust crisper and the toppings less soupy than is traditional in Italy. There's not a bad (or even merely good) pie to be had here, but we're honoring the most authentic, the DOC ($15 for a small, $26 for a 17-inch rectangular pie). The letters connote Denominazione di Origine Controllata (controlled designation of origin), the appellation accorded to Italian products that best reflect their provenance and heritage. At Naples Street Food, the DOC is made with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, imported buffalo mozzarella and basil, with a few cherry tomatoes for added freshness. The original Naples Street Food has a wood-burning oven imported from Italy but the new Oceanside location, which opened in May, uses an Italian-made electric oven that mimics and possibly (dare I say) improves upon its wood-burning cousin.
3. Cannolo pie at Pizza Rita
55 Middle Rd., Mattituck, 631-315-5557. Only open Thursday to Sunday.
This summer, Jeff Marrone's Pizza Rita graduated from mobile catering truck to bricks-and-mortar store, taking over a workaday slice joint that had never seen this level of artistry. Marrone, who named his pizzeria after his grandmother, is pretty much a one-man show, making the pies, bussing the tables, answering the phones, making his own gelato. Mom helps out when she can, Dad splits the oak logs that Marrone feeds into the domed oven that he tiled with broken crockery collected from thrift stores. All the pies display chewy, leopard-spotted rims and just-this-side-of-lavish toppings; the cannolo (randomly named; bearing no relationship to the dessert; $22) is a symphony of mozzarella (made by the chef), ricotta, sausage, oyster and button mushrooms, finished with pecorino, and extra-virgin olive oil.
4. Marinara at Wild Side Organic Bistro & Bar
1551 Montauk Hwy., Oakdale, 631-791-1800, wildsidebistro.com
When Jay Jadeja and Raquel Wolf moved their restaurant from Hicksville to Oakdale in 2016, they installed a wood-burning brick oven in the new space. Jadeja spent the first few months mastering the Neapolitan art of pizza making; now Wolf has assumed the mantle of chief pizzaiola. Wild Side is a haven for restricted diets, and the vegan marinara pizza ($14) here is one of the best, topped only with San Marzano tomatoes, poached garlic, fresh oregano, olive oil and crushed red pepper. For adventurous diners looking for a little Indian-Italian fusion, try the chicken tikka masala pie ($22), silky, mild chicken curry garnished with coriander and cumin seeds, fried green chilies and curry leaves.
5. Potato-rosemary slice at Taglio
85 Mineola Blvd., Mineola; 516-741-0379, tagliopizzany.com
Roman-style pan pizza is the main event at Taglio ("slice" in Italian). The puffy, rectangular pies may look Sicilian but when you examine a slice in cross section, you'll see large air pockets; take a bite and note the elastic-chewy texture, the deep wheaty savor. All of this is the result of a wet, hard-to-handle dough and a dayslong process of fermentation. Chef-owner Rob Cervoni satisfies his customers tastes with "chicken bacon ranch" and eggplant Parm, but the best pies are inspired by Rome's great Pizzarium Bonci. These rotate from week to week but include prosciutto with arugula, and mortadella with artichokes and, the one I wish they had every day, potato with rosemary, a refined combination that, in turn, perplexes, entrances and obsesses. A slice (which gets even crisper when reheated) is $4.50. A whole pie is $25.
6. Margherita metro at King Umberto's
1343 Hempstead Tpke., Elmont; 516-352-8391, kingumberto.com
John Cesarano grew up at King Umberto, the iconic Elmont pizzeria established by his father, Ciro Cesarano, and partner Rosario Fuschetto. But young Cesarano (nom de pizza: "Giovanni Chez") was determined to create something on his own and, last year, he settled on a variation of Roman-style pizza that is baked not in a pan but directly on the floor of the oven. His "metro" pie is a puffy, crusty pizza that's about 10 inches wide and 3 feet long (metro is Italian for "meter"). The metro is all about the crust, chewy yet filled with pockets of air, the result of a long, slow fermentation and gentle handling. There's always a Margherita; wild cards might include prosciutto and arugula, pepperoni with stracciatella cheese and Mike's Hot Honey. Squares are $4.40; full pies are $30; half (mezza) pies are $20.
7. Margherita at Vulcano 081
43 N. Village Ave., Rockville Centre, 516-442-5858, vulcano081.com
More than two years after its founding pizzaiolo, Michael Viglotti, left the operation, Vulcano 081 is still turning out great pizza under the direction of Alex Escobar. (Vigliotti is now slinging pies with Eddie Macari at Avelino Pizza, the seasonal truck usually parked at Macari Vineyards in Mattituck. If the truck were there permanently, it would be ranked here. Very highly.) The restaurant is named after Naples' area code, and the pies have the city's signature puffy rim and floppy crust. Unlike a lot of wood-burning ovens on Long Island, it has no "gas assist" and runs solely on wood. From a roster of almost 20 pies whose toppings range from spicy salami to bacon marmalade, my favorite is the classic Margherita ($14), honorable mention to the Diavola ($17), ignited with spicy salami and Calabrian chili oil.
8. The combo at The Gristmill
144 Main St., East Rockaway, 516-792-6104; thegristmillbob.com
The Gristmill's co-owner and pizzaiolo Jerry Miele has solved the age-old problem of choosing between pizza and calzone with this nifty hybrid, dubbed "the combo" ($16). The calzone "handle," filled with ricotta, mozzarella, pecorino and a little roasted red pepper oil, is the perfect counterpoint to his elegant, Neapolitan pie, dotted with coins of piquant pepperoni. Miele and partner John Orphanos opened their casual "brick oven bistro" last year and immediately vaulted into the top echelon of LI pizzerias. New this year is a liquor license, so you can sit at the bar and unwind while Miele plies his trade.
9. Speck pie at Saverio's
929 Broadway, Massapequa, 516-799-0091, saveriospizza.com
We've long sung the praises of the mellow Mom's pie at this family-run pizzeria but, this year, we're turning the spotlight the Speck pie ($18), an exciting counterpoint to Mom's hushed elegance. Crumpled slices of Speck (smoked prosciutto from Northern Italy) rest on a bed of Parmesan cream and mozzarella and, when they are lightly browned by the oven, get shavings of more Parmesan and, if desired, a final anointing of truffle oil. Since 2015, when Sam and Emily Cataldo carved this tiny pizzeria out of a corner of their Massapequa market, A & S Pork Store, they've had to expand the seating, first outside (in fine weather) and then, during the evenings, to the sales floor of A & S. The cheeseless Mom's ($12), topped with a thin layer of sweet, onion-rich tomato sauce, remains a menu staple. 
10. Open-faced calzone at Donatina Pizza Cafe
18 West Ave., Patchogue; 631-730-7002, donatinapizza.com
They're doing it all at Donatina, John Peragine's new Patchogue pizzeria. In addition to a Neapolitan wood-burning oven, he has a wall of deck ovens for both traditional New York- and Detroit-style pies. (The latter is, essentially, a Sicilian beneath whose toppings is a crust of melted and browned brick and mozzarella cheeses.) We settled on the open-faced calzone ($13), whose torpedo shape maximizes the proportion of well-browned crust. It arrives heaving with a molten filling of fresh mozzarella, ricotta, sausage and marinara sauce. The filling is so rich, you may need to request a little extra marinara on

Full text: EGP MOVES TO ISLAND PARK
For the past eight years, customers of Jordan Lobster Farm in Island Park have had their pick of the parking spots on Pettit Place, but now the competition has just gotten fiercer. EGP Land & Sea has opened just across the street, in the spot that from 1992 to 2011 was Montego Bay.
This is a second location for EGP, a gastropub that opened in Oceanside in 2014. Tim O'Hagan, one of the partners, said that while the two menus were similar - "great burgers, great wings, great beer selection" - the new restaurant is honoring its seaside (or across-the-street-from-the-seaside) location with more seafood entrees such as shrimp scampi ($24) and a "seafood pot" cioppino ($27), with mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp and fish. It also features a salad Nicoise with seared tuna ($21).
For now, the Island Park menu is smaller than Oceanside's, and a little more "gastro" than "pub." Appetizers ($14 to $15) include calamari with Thai chilies and mixed greens, meatball sliders with peppers and arugula pesto. Sandwiches ($16 to $21) range from the Land & Sea burger, topped with lobster salad, and crispy chicken with avocado, bacon and chipotle mayo to filet mignon on ciabatta with mozzarella, sun-dried tomato and ricotta pesto.
At the top end of the entrees, EGP steak and cake ($35) involves a Wagyu flatiron, lump crabcake and creamed spinach; there's also a Berkshire pork chop ($21), chicken with shrimp and crab ($21) and daily fish and meat specials.
EGP Land & Sea also has a lighter feel than the more rathskellerian original. There's still a bit of reclaimed wood, but also neutral tile work and floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides. Between the bar, dining room and patio, there are about 100 seats.
Running the kitchen is William Merget, who most recently was the chef at Da Gigi in Lynbrook.
There are two dozen beers on tap, a similar number of wines (half of them, by the glass) and, of course, craft cocktails. Bridging all three categories is Swashbuckler sangria on tap.
EGP Land & Sea is at 2 Pettit Place, Island Park; 516-544-2879.

SET SAIL FOR HARBOR HOUSE AMERICAN KITCHEN IN NORTHPORT
It takes verve to open a restaurant when you already have your hands full with one. Kevin LaPrelle and his partners have that verve: They've opened Harbor House American Kitchen in downtown Northport, a few doors away from another spot LaPrelle co-owns, Bistro 44.
The roughly 30-seat Harbor House has an elegant-beachy feel and a menu focused squarely on seafood and New American dishes created by executive chef (and partner) Jose Morales, who wears the same credentials at Bistro 44. How would a hungry passerby choose between the two? "[Harbor House] has a more casual feel," said LaPrelle, and intentionally gentler price points than the white-tablecoth Bistro 44.
Harbor House's seafood focus manifests in starters ($7.50 to $26) such as fried calamari, a cold seafood platter, clam chowder, steamed clams with chorizo and mussels, and oysters baked Rockefeller-style. Large plates ($25 to $32) move between pastas, chops, seafood and burgers, such as pan-seared ahi tuna in a ginger-orange sauce, sole française and a Parmesan-crusted wild boar chop. The house Cheddar cheeseburger is $15, and a lobster roll (chilled, on a warm buttered bun) is offered at $25.
A rotating weekly beer from Northport neighbor Sand City Brewing Co. is on tap, besides a dozen or so wines by the glass. Among the house cocktails is frosé with strawberries and honey.
Patrons of Ship's Inn, which occupied this space for 22 years, will recognize the carved ship in the front door; that business was followed by 7T8 European Fusion, which closed following a May 2017 fire on the same block and was replaced for a spell (in 2018) by ArtToro Restaurant & Tequila Bar.
While Harbor House is focusing on dinner for now (4-10 p.m. daily), LaPrelle, a Northport native, said lunch service will be added in coming weeks, as will alfresco seating in a neighboring alley.
Harbor House American Kitchen is at 78 Main St., Northport; 631-651-9093.

Full text: As friends, family and colleagues prepare to lay Det. Luis Alvarez to rest, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced he would honor the memory of the NYPD veteran, who succumbed to Ground Zero-related cancer at 53 years old, with a key to the city.
The mayor was fulfilling a request from Alvarez's fellow 9/11 first responder John Feal, who appeared on CNN's New Day on Monday to speak about Alvarez after his death on Saturday. He pleaded with the mayor to pay tribute to Alvarez's life with a key to the city.
Feal from Nesconset, Alvarez from Oceanside, and other 9/11 first responders joined Jon Stewart at a congressional hearing last month to appeal for the extension of the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund.
"When we lost Ray Pfeifer, who was the face of the movement back then, I asked New York City and the mayor to give Ray the key to New York City. So I'm asking Mayor de Blasio to give Luis the key to New York City," a teary-eyed Feal said on CNN.
Pfeifer of Hicksville, a retired New York City firefighter, died of cancer in May 2017.
A few hours later Monday, the mayor said on Twitter he would move forward with Feal's request.
"This city can never repay its debt to Detective Lou Alvarez. It will be my honor to award him with a posthumous Key to the City as a symbol of our profound respect and gratitude for his service and sacrifice," he tweeted.
The mayor's office didn't provide details about any additional events to honor Alvarez.
His wake will take place Tuesday at the Towers Funeral Home Inc., 2681 Long Beach Rd., in Oceanside from 1 to 4 p.m. and from 6 to 9 p.m. Alvarez's funeral is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday at Immaculate Conception Church in Astoria.
His congressional testimony, which he gave before he began his 69th round of chemotherapy, helped raise awareness for the fund, which is set to expire in December 2020.
"I should not be here with you, but you made me come. You made me come because I will not stand by and watch as my friends with cancer from 9/11, like me, are valued less than anyone else," he said.
The House Judiciary Committee approved bipartisan legislation to renew the fund following the emotional hearing. A group of 9/11 first responders who later met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the lawmaker committed to scheduling an August vote to renew the fund.
"We all have targets on our back, and time is of the essence," Feal said on CNN. "Congress and the Senate, they need to sense that urgency now."

Pool love: A summer romance: FOR SOME, THE GLOW LASTS A LIFETIME. FOR OTHERS, NOT SO MUCH

Full text: Ray Beck and his wife, Lori, decided to take the plunge 32 years ago. By adding a pool, that is.
Choosing to install one on their Baywood property was a bit of a whim at the time, but they say they considered it a good way for their young son and daughter to learn water safety and how to swim. Their in-ground model had a waterslide, and Ray, now 71, and Lori, 69, envisioned summer parties on the surrounding deck.
There were indeed parties. But years passed and the kids left. Gathering around the pool with friends became less appealing for Beck, a retired New York City police detective, after he had a scare with melanoma from sun exposure. Finally, keeping up with the chemicals, cleaning the pool and paying the tax bill became too much.
"It was a money pit," says Beck. "We decided to pull the plug."
Yvonne Murphy, 50, decided to take the plunge a year ago when she bought a home in Oceanside with a semi-in-ground pool. Murphy grew up with a pool at her family residence in Coram and loved every minute of it. Their house was a neighborhood magnet for her friends. She and her siblings often spent their musical instrument practice time around the pool, then jumped in afterward. Now, at the Oceanside home, her own three daughters use the pool constantly and, just like at Yvonne's childhood home, their friends show up, too.
"We're serious about our pool," says Murphy, the owner of a geriatric care management agency. "Now, I get to be in the position of my mother, where everyone comes over and has a good time and I get to watch."
A swimming pool is a dream come true for some. For others, not so much.
"I tell people it's kind of like getting a boat," says Lou Russo, of RemoveYourPool.com, whose East Meadow company removes and fills in pools of those disillusioned with their watery pleasure. "The most exciting day of your life is buying a pool -- and getting rid of the pool."
A study last year by the National Association of Realtors examining the appeal of remodeling and landscaping projects ranked having a new pool 12th out of 13 outdoor attractions. When it came to adding value to a home for resale, it came in last, at number 13. (Lawn care and landscaping were at the top.)
In the same study, less than 1 percent of Realtors suggested sellers add a pool before attempting to sell their home and only 2 percent said the project sealed the deal. Also, the value recovered from adding a pool was less than 50 percent of its price, they said.
But the study showed another side of the coin. Ninety-two percent of the consumers who put in a pool said they had a greater desire to stay at home once it was installed. And 83 percent said they were happier sticking around the ol' homestead.
There is no denying that for some people having a swimming pool is a fantasy come true, says Greg Darvin, owner of Pristine Pools in East Hampton, which specializes in high-end projects. "It's a symbol of success and something they've dreamed about all their lives," he says.
Throw in a diving board, a Jacuzzi, an outdoor kitchen with a grill, maybe a slide for the kids or an extended shelf where the adults can sip drinks while undulating in the water, and it's the good life come true.
Yes, pools come with chores, but consider this, Darvin says. A backyard pool is private. You don't have to drive to the beach, and the overall cost is more palatable if it replaces a gym membership.
"Some people get in a workout before they have their morning coffee," he says.
That was sort of what Fran Burke, a director of a community residential rehab agency in Suffolk County, had in mind when he put in his pool 15 years ago at his Port Jefferson home. He says he figured it would become a focal point for his two children. What he didn't count on was that they would join the high school swim team, requiring them to spend six days a week training.
"The last thing they wanted to do when they got home was jump into a 20-by-40-foot yard pool," he says.
He and his wife, Linda, used it occasionally, but the children moved away and eventually the pool deteriorated to the point it would have cost $20,000 to fix up, he says. If he did, it would be back to square one with the upkeep.
"It was like a prison sentence," he says.
This was when he contacted Lou Russo, who has been deconstructing swimming pools on Long Island for 18 years. Russo says he removes 50 to 80 a year, mostly for people whose pools have languished for years and would be quite costly to repair. Most pool-removal jobs cost around $10,000, and a town permit may be required, he says.
"Sometimes I take out pools that are perfectly fine,'' he says. "People are just done with the maintenance."
Parting is sweet sorrow for some pool owners. One couple in Lynbrook had a dilapidated pool but didn't want to take it down. So, they kept it and put in goldfish to keep down the mosquitoes, Russo says. It didn't work, and they finally conceded it had to be removed. His crew lowered the water level, scooped up the goldfish in buckets and gave them away to people with ponds.
That isn't going to happen to Phil Trugman, a Plainview man who has had a pool for 34 years. For him, the pool life is the only life. His family grills all summer by the water. They have parties, they watch television outdoors. Recently, he held a bridal party for his daughter in the backyard.
"Basically, we're out here every weekend from Friday to Sunday," says Trugman, 65, a retired sales manager. "Everyone comes over. It's like a resort out here."
Yes, there are expenses, he says. Also, danger. But he taught his son and daughter to swim at a young age and makes sure adult supervisors are on watch whenever friends bring over their children. Also, his pool alarm alerts him if anyone tries to sneak in at night. It's all good.
"The hard part is taking everything down at the end of summer and setting everything up the week before Memorial Day," he says.
Yvonne Murphy doesn't disagree. "We love everything about it," she says. "We've got the pool, the BBQ grill, the water. It's a beautiful life."
THE COSTS OF OWNING A POOL The bottom line for the cost of a swimming pool is there is no bottom line. Above or semi-above-ground versions can mean an outlay of a few thousand dollars up to something in the teens. In-ground types can run hundreds of thousands of dollars. Add waterfalls, fountains, Jacuzzis and multicolored fiber optic lighting and you're talking hedge fund money. "Costs are all over the place, depending on what you want," says George Kazdin, president of Kazdin Pools & Spas in Southampton. Here are some ballpark figures for pool upkeep tallied by talking to several Long Island retailers: MAINTENANCE Generally, this means chemicals such as chlorine, pool "shock," test kits for pH and alkalinity and water conditioner. Do it yourself and the bill can range between $300 to $400 for the season. Having the pool serviced can cost $50 to $150 an hour on a weekly basis. EQUIPMENT Robot cleaners for in-ground pools will run $1,500 to $2,500, but there is less expensive DIY equipment. Safety mesh pool covers cost from $1,500 to $2,000 depending on their size (automatic ones run $10,000 or more). Pool heaters (there are both gas and electric types) range from $2,500 to $4,500 and will kick up your utility expenses. Also, count on your water bill going up between $60 to $120 a month during the season. SAFETY CONCERNS New York State requires pools be enclosed by a fence at least 4 feet high with childproof gates and an alarm system. For an average-sized yard, this can cost between $3,000 and $7,000, depending on whether the fence is chain link or plastic. Also, be aware that pool contractors must have some knowledge of engineering, plumbing, landscaping and electrical work, so check if they have a license from the county consumer affairs department. INSURANCE AND TAXES An average-sized pool is covered as an "other structure" in most instances, insurance agents say, but an extravagant pool could add $200 to $300 annually to a policy. As far as property taxes, owners with above-ground pools may not be affected since they are not considered as adding value to a home. But in-ground pool owners likely will see a jump. How much varies from town to town. In Huntington, for example, putting in a 20-by-40-foot pool would increase property taxes by about $1,300 a year, according to a town spokesman. THE TOTAL As far as the initial cost of the pool, fences, alarms, etc., it all depends on your dreams and pocketbook. As far as maintaining one in good working condition, pool retailers generally agree it runs between $3,000 to $5,000 for

Never too old to party: Grown-ups find creative venues to throw themselves birthday celebrations

Full text: You're never too old for a birthday party - even if you have to plan it yourself. And plenty of adults, Long Island restaurants say, are doing just that these days.
There's an adult giving a birthday party for themselves almost every weekend at The Refuge in Melville, so much so that the restaurant even offers special packages for these events, according to manager Tanya Narang.
"We do a lot of them, it's pretty common for us," Narang says. The parties are given by both men and women, generally range from about 10 people to 60 or more, and are either informal cocktail parties or sit-down dinners.   
While it's particularly popular among people celebrating milestone birthdays - such as their 30th, 40th or 50th -  a lot of restaurants find that adults don't want to wait around for someone else to give them a public birthday party, so they take it upon themselves. And this is nothing particularly new.
Christine Hartt, manager of That Meetball Place in Farmingdale, says women in their twenties are giving themselves birthday parties at the restaurant, often with a familiar formula.  "Usually they arrange it and it's like, 'I'm going, who's coming?'" Harrt says. "They wear sashes and crowns as if they're a bachelorette so the whole place knows whose birthday it is." Routinely, she adds, it's the guests - not the host - who are expected to foot the bill.
The Refuge offers two packages for these parties - including a two-hour option for $49.95 per person that includes beer, wine sangria, chips and dip, an assortment of pizzas and a mini buffet with pasta, salad and chicken. "We're able to book two of those a night and still have room for the public," Narang says. The restaurant's lounge area is perfect for the festivities, since it's closest to the restaurant's deejay, allowing partygoers to make music requests.
Denise Burns of Huntington says she's had a rough few years, including getting through a divorce, so this year she gave herself a 49th birthday party earlier this month. About 30 people came to her Huntington home - not a restaurant - for an afternoon of professional massages, tons of food and drinks, and singing that lasted until after midnight.
"I always thought that would be kind of weird - giving a birthday party for yourself," says Burns, a wellness coach.  "I've struggled with depression, so I wanted to celebrate life and I wanted to do this at the moment I wanted to do it - I wanted to celebrate life and my health."

Full text: Mark Flugman of Merrick recalls his courtship with his future wife, Pam.
One day in 1972, I ran into a friend on the SUNY Cortland campus who was with a girl I didn't know. My friend then introduced me to Pam Greenfader, a freshman from Massapequa. I was from Oceanside and was in my second year at Cortland. Pam was 18, and I was 19. The next time I saw her, I asked her out, not for one date but for two consecutive dates over the course of a weekend. She accepted.
The first date was to a Beach Boys concert hosted by the Student Union. I was the photographer for concert events and was allowed to invite a guest. On our second date, we went to a movie and to Friendly's for ice cream. We had a great time and became inseparable.
One of our dates was to a Billy Joel concert. We spent time with him and his band while I took photos. I was even asked to hand him the check for the performance.
In 1973, Pam and I both transferred to Hofstra University in Hempstead. I was taking pre-med courses. I had decided to go to medical school in Mexico at Guadalajara University after graduation. We planned to marry and move to Mexico together. Pam accelerated her studies so we were both able to graduate in 1974. She received a degree in teaching the speech- and hearing-impaired.
On July 3, 1974, we exchanged our vows at the former Huntington Town House. We spent a three-day honeymoon in Bermuda. Then Pam and I returned to our summer jobs as counselors at Treasure Island, a day camp in Oceanside.
We left for Mexico on Sept. 29. Pam set up a beautiful apartment for us there, made delicious meals every night and baked literally thousands of chocolate chip cookies for me and my classmates. We made lifelong friends there. Pam also worked as a private English tutor while I went to classes.
After I graduated in 1978, we returned home. Pam taught seventh- and eighth-grade Spanish at Robert A. Van Wyck Junior High School in Jamaica, Queens. In 1979, I was conferred a medical degree from The State University of New York. Pam was supportive over the next six years, all through my rotating internship, as well as general surgery and ophthalmology residency at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow. Together, Pam and I have endured the early death of my mother to cancer and the hit-and-run crash that killed both of her parents 19 years ago.
In 1984, I started a private practice, and we moved to Merrick. The practice is now in Rockville Centre, where Pam is the business manager and owns and runs an optical department in the office.
We have two wonderful children and a terrific son-in-law. Probably one of the greatest compliments we ever received was from our daughter, who stated she wants a marriage just like ours. We celebrated our 44th anniversary by taking our boat out for the day then having a great dinner at our favorite restaurant.
I kiss Pam goodbye every morning before I leave for the office, even though I'll see her there in a few hours. I always feel good when she arrives. Pam is definitely my soul mate and, without a doubt, asking her to be my wife is the best decision I ever made.
-With Virginia Dunleavy

Full text: Senior Gabrielle Zaffiro scored her 2,500th career point on a baseline jumper with five minutes left in the third quarter as North Shore defeated Valley Stream South, 61-32, Friday night in a Nassau A-IV girls basketball game.
Zaffiro ended the game with 32 points and now has 2,504 career points and is North Shore's all-time leading scorer, coach Keith Freund said. The Amherst College signee added nine steals, eight rebounds and two assists, as North Shore led 36-15 at the half. Jennifer Walton scored all 11 of her points in the second half for North Shore (9-0) Nassau A-IV.
"When I first saw her, she was a baggy-shorts, baggy-socks second-grader at a basketball camp," Freund said of Zaffiro. "It was obvious the kid had talent, but she's also put in a lot of time and effort. It's her love of the game that makes her special."
Brentwood 51, Sachem East 50: Ty'Zhea Hawkins (19 points) made a three-pointer with nine seconds left to put Brentwood (4-6) ahead by one and Josselyn Herrera (10 rebounds) took a charge on the ensuing possession to seal the Indians' Suffolk I win.

South Nassau Communities Hospital officially partners with Mt. Sinai: The agreement will align medical services, management and governance of the two health care institutions

Abstract: None available.

Full text: South Nassau Communities Hospital officially became the Long Island flagship health care institution in the Mount Sinai system after a unanimous vote by the Oceanside hospital's board of trustees Tuesday night.
Mount Sinai Health System trustees approved the agreement last month, executives said.
Talks were first announced last May when executives on both sides of the affiliation said they intended to explore a formal agreement that would align medical services, management and governance of the two institutions.
No decision has yet been made on how Mount Sinai's name will be incorporated into that of South Nassau. In a similar affiliation between NYU and the former Winthrop-University Hospital, a formalized agreement resulted in the Mineola institution being renamed NYU Winthrop Hospital.
South Nassau, a 455-bed hospital that has served Long Island's South Shore since 1928, is expected to expand its facilities under the agreement, with a $120 million capital contribution from Mount Sinai. The cash will aid South Nassau's five-year master facility plan, which expands the hospital's surgical facilities, intensive care units, and emergency department.
"Our goal from the outset was to find a partner seeking to expand services on Long Island who, like us, puts patients first, employing cutting-edge science and treatments," Joseph Fennessy, chairman of South Nassau's board of directors, said in a statement Tuesday. He led the hospital's affiliation talks.
The Mount Sinai system is an $8 billion health care provider that includes the Icahn School of Medicine, seven hospitals in the metropolitan area, and a network of more than 6,500 physicians.
"Long Island has been a target for us for several reasons. No. 1, we have a growing physician presence in Hewlett, Nesconset, Huntington, Bay Shore and Manhasset," said Dr. Arthur Klein, president of the Mount Sinai Health Network. He said about 200 Long Island private practice physicians are affiliated with Mount Sinai.
"What we had been lacking was a true institutional partner. Being landlocked here in Manhattan, we thought it was important to grow and expand our reach. So when South Nassau put out a request for partnership proposal, we responded very enthusiastically," Klein said.
Pre- and post-transplant care, especially for liver transplants, now will be offered in Oceanside with transplants available through Mount Sinai in Manhattan, long a leader in transplant medicine, Klein said.
Richard J. Murphy, South Nassau's president and chief executive, said the affiliation provides "a unique, once-in-a-generation opportunity" that he predicts will expand the delivery of many advanced health care services for all Long Islanders. He pointed to increased access to clinical trials, enhanced cancer treatment services and state-of-the-art cardiac surgery.
"We will be their flagship hospital on Long Island," Murphy said during an interview before Tuesday's vote.
He added that the affiliation will also expand medical education opportunities for doctors-in-training, with the opening of an internal medicine residency program on South Nassau's campus.
Internal medicine is considered a key residency training program in teaching hospitals. Currently, South Nassau offers residencies in family medicine, general surgery, podiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology.
Another bonus the affiliation brings is Mount Sinai's close relationship with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where advanced care for rare and complex disorders has long aided the pediatric population. Sick children treated at South Nassau will now have access to care at the Philadelphia hospital, often called CHOP.
"We are thrilled about what this means for patients and families on Long Island, and look forward to working closely with our Long Island partners to continue advancing care in the region," Kenneth L. Davis, Mount Sinai Health System's CEO, said in a statement Tuesday.

Woman accused of mistreating dogs
A Wyandanch woman is facing charges related to animal cruelty after her two dogs were found in "horrible condition" last week at the Babylon Animal Shelter, a Suffolk County SPCA official said Sunday.
SPCA Chief Roy Gross said the dogs were picked up by animal shelter workers on Thursday as strays and the shelter called the SPCA to report them as cases of "severe animal neglect."
Gross said the SPCA investigation found the dogs to be owned by Blanca Andrade, 49. She is charged with two counts of failure to provide proper sustenance, which Gross noted includes veterinary care.
The dogs are a male Shih Tzu and a female Lhasa apso, Gross said, and were determined to be "severely matted, filthy and suffering from various untreated health issues" following an SPCA investigation.
Gross said the dogs also had irritated skin and the male had eye and ear infections.
"His ribs and spine were visible after he was shaved down," Gross said. "Both dogs were in pain - they cried out when touched."
The dogs were being kept at the shelter for observation and Andrade is scheduled to appear in First District Court in Central Islip on July 2.
Gross asked anyone with any information on a case of animal cruelty or neglect to contact the Suffolk County SPCA at 631-382-7722. All calls will be kept confidential.- LISA IRIZARRY

Man charged with DWI with minor
A Lawrence man faces charges after driving drunk in Oceanside early Sunday with a minor in the car, Nassau County police said.
Carlos F. Ruiz-Mendoza, 42, of Spring Street, was charged with aggravated driving while intoxicated under Leandra's Law and several vehicle and traffic violations.
According to police, Ruiz-Mendoza was driving a 2003 Acura north on Lawson Boulevard at 2:45 a.m. with a front-seat female passenger and a male passenger, 13, in the back seat.
Police said Ruiz-Mendoza "was unable to maintain his travel lane" and a car stop was conducted.
An investigation revealed Ruiz-Mendoza "was operating under the influence of alcohol," police said. The boy was released to the custody of a relative.
No online information on his bail status was available.- LISA IRIZARRY

Christian DeNave's four-hit shutout leads Massapequa to Nassau Class AA crown

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Christian DeNave stood confidently on the mound at SUNY-Old Westbury on Monday. But the road wasn't easy for Massapequa as the defending Nassau AA baseball champion opened the season losing five of nine games. After ending the regular season winning eight straight, the No. 4 Chiefs entered the playoffs playing their best ball of the season.
The streak hasn't stopped as Massapequa defeated No. 1 Oceanside, 5-0, completing its quest for back-to-back titles behind DeNave's four-hit shutout. Massapequa (19-6) has won 14 straight. Oceanside finishes 21-4.
"I wanted to be in this spot, I couldn't wait for it the whole season," DeNave said. "I knew we were going to get here somehow, and I'm just glad I was able to close it out."
Massapequa plays Suffolk AA champion West Islip at 7 p,m. on Saturday at SUNY-Old Westbury in the Long Island Class AA championship/Southeast Regional final.
DeNave was helped by a diving catch from rightfielder Wade Kelly that started a double play with no outs in the top of the fourth.
"That was probably the biggest play of the game, honestly," DeNave said. "It gave us so much energy and I feel like he really saved me on that one."
The offense took over from there, as Massapequa scored four runs in the bottom half of the inning, taking a 5-0 lead. Phil Cottone's single up the middle drove in Kelly and Andy Primm hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Aidan Cooney, giving Massapequa a 3-0 lead.
James Zupo added an RBI single and Nick Schwartz, who had walked, scored on an error for the final run of the inning.
"We knew what we had to do today and we were fortunate enough that we were able to do that," said Cottone, who went 2-for-4. "I think the fourth inning showed that."
After reaching last season's state championship game, Primm, a catcher and this year's captain, is looking to lead Massapequa to another chance at the crown.
"We were hungry this year," Primm said. "We weren't a championship team at the beginning of the year but we have a lot of grit and a lot of fight in us and that's what's special about this team. We just keep fighting and we don't lose."

'Hometown Hero' hailed: Clerk stepped up when baby wasn't breathing

Author: Robert

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Five-week-old Sergio DeVincent had stopped breathing and his face was turning blue. Sergio's distressed parents, who were shopping for a stroller at Buy Buy Baby last week, called out desperately for help, seeking anyone who knew CPR.
Katherine Falco of Elmont, a registered nurse and part-time sales associate at the Garden City store, responded, placing the child on the floor and performing life saving "rescue breathing" on the infant, likely saving Sergio's life.
On Friday, Falco, a retired pediatric and ob-gyn delivery nurse at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, was honored by Town of Hempstead officials and state lawmakers for her heroism.
"It happened so fast," Falco said at a news conference at the store. "It was like a moment of time. To be there at the right time at the right place. God puts you there for certain reasons in life and I truly believe that."
Hempstead Receiver of Taxes Donald Clavin, who awarded Falco the town's first "Hometown Hero" award, said her actions were inspirational.
"What makes a person a hero is somebody who does the extraordinary, who steps up when you need it the most," Clavin said. "The story surrounding Kathy Falco and what she has done and how she rose to the occasion and became a hero would inspire anybody."
State Sen. Elaine Phillips (R-Flower Hill) also presented Falco with the Liberty Medal, the highest honor given by the Senate.
On Sept. 6, Alexandria and Joseph DeVincent were shopping when their son Sergio - who was born with a hole in the wall of his heart that interferes with his blood and oxygen flow - started to cry and cough. When his face turned blue, Alexandria DeVincent began to panic.
"I thought he was going to die," she said.
Twenty minutes into her shift, Falco, who works only one day a week at the store, ran to the child and took over while Joseph DeVincent called 911.
With a 911 operator on speakerphone providing guidance, Falco gently tilted Sergio's head back and began breathing into the infant's mouth and nose while intermittently performing chest compressions, Alexandria DeVincent said.
"Within seconds he started crying and I said, 'Thank God, he's coming back,' " Falco said. "He continued to cry harder and harder. I said, 'Sergio, get mad at me. I want you to get mad at me so you are crying and fill up those lungs.' "
Jim Mahoney, the store manager, said he could hardly believe what he was seeing.
"I watched over with my eyes welling up cause I couldn't believe she was saving this life on the floor right there in my store," Mahoney said. "And everybody watching couldn't believe it either."
EMTs quickly arrived and took Sergio to a nearby hospital. He is in the pediatric intensive care unit at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, DeVincent said and will need open heart surgery in about six weeks to correct the defect.
DeVincent said she is forever thankful that Falco's quick actions saved her son's life.
"I am so grateful to her and grateful she was there," DeVincent said. "She just knew what to do."

Sherylyn Brightman dies of cancer; mom shared beauty with lens: 'She wanted her kids to see what she saw when the sun rose,' her family said of the avid photographer

Author: Bauman, Valerie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sherylyn Brightman, a Long Island native who raised four children on her own, working four to five jobs at once, died Saturday of cervical cancer, her family said.
Brightman, also known as Sherry, was 58. She died at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip.
Born May 7, 1959, in Oceanside, she graduated from East Islip High School in 1977.
Brightman often worked several receptionist jobs at the same time, she also made time to pursue her hobby of photography, turning her work into greeting cards and selling them locally to help support her family.
She was "a strong woman," said her daughter, Raychel Brightman, of Northport, a multimedia producer at Newsday.
Brightman was passionate about her children and sought to show them the world through a creative lens.
"She gave us all a camera when we were 5 and she took us out to Fire Island at 5 a.m. to take pictures of the sunrise," Raychel Brightman said. "It was the beauty of the shores that kept Mom on Long Island all her life. She wanted her kids to see what she saw when the sun rose."
Sherry Brightman was first diagnosed with cancer in 2004, but it went into remission after treatment, her family said. The disease returned three years ago.
However, she fought it long enough to attend the wedding of her son, Richard Brightman of Providence, three weeks before her death. She had blood clots in her legs and lungs, but insisted on leaving the hospital and even getting out of her wheelchair for a final dance with her son.
They held each other, swaying to Tony Bennett's version of "The Way You Look Tonight" until her knees could no longer hold her, Raychel Brightman said.
Her love for children extended to her nieces and nephews, said former Newsday Publisher Fred Groser, Sherry Brightman's brother-in-law.
"She was always one my kids could talk to when they couldn't talk to their parents," he said.
Sherry Brightman also had a way of finding lonely people and welcoming them into her life, Raychel Brightman said. For example, while working as a receptionist, she befriended an older customer who had no one to care for him.
"Hearing the loneliness in his withered voice, she took him out to lunch," Raychel Brightman said. "Then became his part-time caregiver and friend until he passed away."
Known for her generosity, Sherry Brightman had a Sunday ritual in which she would go to a local diner with family and look for someone eating all alone and anonymously treat them to a free meal.
"She would pick up the check for them, even if she didn't have the money for it," said her daughter, adding that she will carry on that tradition in honor of her mother.
Other survivors include two daughters, Marissa Brightman and Mikaela Brightman, both of West Islip; sister Renee Groser of Yardley, Pennsylvania; parents Rosemarie and Donald Getrost, of Islip Terrace; and brothers Robert Getrost of Waxhaw, North Carolina, and Gary Getrost of Gilford, Connecticut.

Lawmakers ask state for dog park addition
State Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) and Rockville Centre Mayor Francis X. Murray have asked state officials to add a dog park to Hempstead Lake State Park, according to the senator's office.
Kaminsky and Murray wrote a letter last week to Wayne Horsley, Long Island regional director at the state's Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. They asked that the department "review the feasibility of establishing an enclosed dog park" at the state park.
Many of their constituents do not have a dog park within a "reasonable distance from their homes," Kaminsky and Murray said in the letter.
"Pets are extensions, if not outright members, of many of the families who reside in the greater Rockville Centre area," the elected officials wrote. "Your agency would be providing an invaluable service by creating a designated area where owners and their pets can safely recreate."

ST. JAMES
Vote on $2M Lake Ave. proposal today
St. James' Lake Avenue would be remade under a $2 million proposal that the Smithtown Town Board is scheduled to take up today.
The plan calls for new asphalt on the roadway along with tree planting, new sidewalks and crosswalks, benches and decoration to make the hamlet's central commercial strip more attractive to pedestrians and shoppers.
"It's going to bring back the historic character of Lake Avenue, bring back that historical charm better than ever," said Deputy Supervisor Tom McCarthy, who said he began work on the plan with town staff earlier this year.
The work would be funded by an amendment to the 2017 capital budget, which calls for $7.7 million in spending this year on parks, downtown beautification and highway equipment. Work on Lake Avenue would start in June and last about six months, McCarthy said.
Lake Avenue was first rebuilt in the 1930s, according to the town Planning Department. Problems with parking and flooding have cropped up in recent years, and the business district is not as vibrant as it once was, town planners wrote in a report last week.
Improving the avenue's look - especially for walkers and window shoppers - could encourage private investment and improve business activity in the area, they wrote.
Kerry Maher-Weisse, president of the Community Association of Greater St. James, said her members are thrilled. "Residents and business owners are going to be excited, because this is a long time coming," she said.
The plan would resurface a municipal parking lot near Burke Veterans Memorial Park, addressing a parking shortage Maher-Weisse has said is throttling some of the businesses in the hamlet downtown. It does not include new lots, something the association has called for, but McCarthy said the town board would consider leasing land for lots along Lake Avenue as it becomes available.

BRIGHTWATERS
Mayor pulls salary proposal after outcry
Brightwaters Mayor Joe McDermott said he has pulled a proposal to pay village trustees after hearing criticism from residents last month.
In the proposed $2.6 million budget for 2017-18, McDermott had proposed a resolution to pay the mayor $6,000 and trustees $3,600 annually, a $20,400 total expenditure. He said at the time that the village is one of the few that does not pay or provide trustees with benefits and proposed putting the resolution to a public vote.
At an April 3 public hearing, enough residents complained about the compensation that McDermott decided to pull the resolution at the board's April 24 work session.
"The village residents were not happy with it, and we rescinded it before it went to a public vote," McDermott said, adding that he respected the public commentary. "It's the people's village and I work for them," he said. "It's my job to listen to the people's voice."
The new budget was to raise taxes 3.5 percent, but the elimination of the trustee compensation lowered the tax increase to 2.3 percent.
The board passed the amended budget 5-0 at the April 24 meeting.

BAXTER ESTATES
Landmarks group weighs violation
The Baxter Estates Landmarks Preservation Commission will vote today to formally approve a prior decision that the owner of the village's sole landmarked property has violated preservation laws.
The vote on a written resolution follows a preliminary vote on April 24 that will authorize village officials to proceed with issuing a violation.
The centuries-old home, called the Baxter House, is at 15 Shore Rd. Homeowner Sabrina Wu submitted an application on April 17 to demolish the property. The application was subsequently returned and deemed incomplete by village officials, because it did not include several required documents.
Village Clerk Chrissy Kiernan said yesterday that "to her knowledge," the application remains incomplete.
The meeting is at 8 a.m. today at Village Hall, 315 Main St. in Port Washington.

HUNTINGTON
Forum for park stewards on Tuesday
The Town of Huntington's Conservation Board will hold a semiannual meeting for its park stewards Tuesday.
The Conservation Board holds such meetings once in the fall and another in the spring. They choose topics for discussion that will be interesting and useful to park stewards and relevant to parks in the town, town officials said.
Items on the agenda for the upcoming meeting include presentations on oak wilt fungus and southern pine beetle, the Asian long-horned beetle and the town's Tree City Recognition.
The Conservation Board coordinates the park steward program. Residents are appointed by the town board to the program to monitor parkland. The stewards report fallen trees and limbs, damaged equipment, litter and dumping and acts of vandalism to the town's appropriate authorities.
The meeting is open to the public and the presenters will take some questions.
The meeting is at 7:30 p.m. at Town Hall, 100 Main St., Room 114.

Town, LI Nets to host summer youth clinics
Hempstead Town is partnering with the Long Island Nets to host free youth basketball clinics at town parks over the summer, officials said.
The clinics are for children ages 6 to 13 who are town residents, officials said in a news release. Children are only allowed to attend one clinic.
The sessions are from 10-11:30 a.m. and will be held on July 15 at Veterans Memorial Park in East Meadow; Aug. 12 at Oceanside Park in Oceanside; and Sept. 16 at Newbridge Road Park in South Bellmore, the release said.
"Teaming up with the Long Island Nets to provide free basketball clinics for kids is a 'slam dunk,' " Supervisor Anthony Santino said in the release.
The Long Island Nets will play at the NYCB Live's Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in the fall; their first season was at the Barclays Center while the coliseum was being renovated.
Registration opens June 1 at bit.ly/toh-hoops.

SHELTER ISLAND
Farm's wastewater system install feted
Sylvester Manor Educational Farm officials and state and county legislators will celebrate a milestone this week in the farm's efforts to construct a wastewater treatment system expected to drastically cut nitrogen levels in surrounding waters.
The Shelter Island-based farm's new system would be Suffolk County's first installation of an alternative on-site "constructed wetlands treatment system," officials with Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone's office confirmed Friday.
Bellone said in a statement Friday that the new system "builds upon our efforts to combat nitrogen pollution on Shelter Island."
Farm officials said the project was expected to be finished "within days" of the ceremony.
Jo-Ann Robotti, the farm's executive director, said the need to reduce the impact of activities on the 1700s-era educational farm prompted officials to consider the system as a way to cut nitrogen levels in the water and "provide the public beautiful, accessible facilities anytime the grounds are open."
While manor officials declined to specify the final projected costs of the project, they said they received more than $200,000 in grant funding from Suffolk County for system costs.
The ceremony will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday at the farm, on 80 North Ferry Rd.

Nassau July 4th fireworks show held after postponement

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Thousands of people watched Nassau County's 14th annual Fourth of July fireworks show Sunday night at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow after weather conditions canceled the festivities the night before.
Many staked out early spots for prime views at the Harry Chapin Lakeside Theater hours before the show started. Children roamed around playing Twister, blowing bubbles and playing catch.
Nassau County police said the event historically draws more than 20,000 people inside the park and an additional 10,000 at outside venues such as Nassau Community College.
The show was sponsored and presented by the county, Bellport-based Fireworks by Grucci and TD Bank.
Sitting in blue deck chairs, Lori and Keith Siebner of Bethpage said their kids had gone elsewhere for the fireworks, but they were enjoying the evening.
"It's a beautiful night; we decided to come out," Lori Siebner, 53, said. "There's no other country like this."
Guy and Irene Scala of Oceanside brought their three children - ages 2 months, 8 and 10 - to the event. The couple said Eisenhower Park was one of the best locations to see fireworks.
The family said they enjoyed the waterfront setting and upbeat music, even though the baby slept through most of the show.
Many in the crowd were prepared with picnic snacks as they listened to classic-rock cover bands before the fireworks. Juliette Tamar, 34, of Uniondale arrived four hours early with her family, toting a feast of fried chicken, stewed peas and watermelon.
"We come every year, for the kids," she said. "We cooked it all last night."
Bernard Rebuffel, 29, of Brooklyn, said this was his first time attending Nassau's fireworks show.
"Celebrating America is a meaningful thing to me," he said. "People talk about barbecues and parties, but we should also remember the history."
People lined up in droves for the ice cream trucks and other cold snacks in the balmy weather as kids danced to "Shake, Rattle and Roll."
Andrew Hinds, 23, an ice cream seller, said it was one of the biggest sale days for the Good Humor ice cream trucks stationed at the event. He said he had already sold out of SpongeBob pops by 7:15 p.m.

One-third of LI, NYC has gone to work with flu, survey says: Most of 600 respondents know virus is contagious, data show 42% wrongly believe vaccine can trigger flu, South Nassau Communities Hospital says

Author: Ricks, Delthia

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]05 Jan 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1855276154?accountid=37869

Abstract: The survey, conducted in December by the national polling firm, LJR Custom Strategies, is a first-of-its-kind public-opinion barometer for the hospital, aimed at assessing the local population's understanding of an important public health concern, South Nassau spokesman Joseph Calderone said.

Full text:   Although more than 90 percent of people surveyed on Long Island and throughout the greater metropolitan area say they're well aware the flu is spread person-to-person, about a third admitted going to work with the infection, a new poll has found.
Working while sick cuts across a sharp gender divide, according to a survey commissioned by South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside.
Regionwide, men are more likely than women to show up to work with the flu: 37 percent of men aged 50 and older acknowledged doing so, compared with 28 percent of women in the same age group.
Dr. Adhi Sharma, the hospital's chief medical officer, said the male tendency to report to work with a highly contagious condition may be interpreted as machismo - an attitude of "toughing it out."
But the survey also may have uncovered segments of the workforce without sick leave, Sharma said. "If you don't have paid sick time, you go to work sick," he said.
The survey, conducted in December by the national polling firm, LJR Custom Strategies, is a first-of-its-kind public-opinion barometer for the hospital, aimed at assessing the local population's understanding of an important public health concern, South Nassau spokesman Joseph Calderone said.
South Nassau doctors will elaborate on the poll's results Thursday morning at the hospital.
Respondents know that the flu is sometimes fatal, with 66 percent saying they are aware that people can die from the infection. Federal statistics suggest that as many as 36,000 people die of the viral condition and another 200,000 people are hospitalized because of influenza annually.
Hospital officials hope the current survey serves as the first in a series of assessments on other critical health issues. "We basically would like to do a poll a quarter," Calderone said.
Data in the survey of 600 residents in Nassau and Suffolk counties and New York City revealed that 42 percent of people think the influenza virus can be transmitted by a flu shot. An equal number of respondents - 42 percent - didn't think the vaccine triggers the infection.
About two-thirds of those surveyed said it's important to get vaccinated annually, and 57 percent of respondents said they had already gotten a flu shot.
Dr. Aaron Glatt, chairman of the hospital's department of medicine, said the belief that the flu vaccine causes the infection "is one of those myths that just won't go away."
"You can't get the flu from a flu shot," said Glatt, who also is the hospital's epidemiologist and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He said someone who already is infected could spread the virus to others from about one day before symptoms are apparent to seven days after becoming sick.
Flu season in this hemisphere runs from late fall through early spring, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "And it's not too late to get a flu shot," Glatt said.
New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker last week declared influenza prevalent statewide, and because of his declaration, unvaccinated health care workers must wear masks in the presence of patients.
Sharma, meanwhile, underscored that the goal of polling the local population is to gather perceptions about a critical health issue and provide public education.
The flu, he said, leads to numerous avoidable emergency department visits throughout the region. Preventive steps, such as "cough and sneezing" etiquette, hand hygiene and vaccination, he said, can stop the infection's spread. He and Glatt defined the etiquette as coughing or sneezing into a sleeve. Hand-washing helps stop the spread of infection.
"Vaccines have saved more lives than anything in medicine, even more than antibiotics," Sharma said.

Full text: The only produce harvested on Long Island during winter is grown indoors, but that doesn't stop local farmers markets. At these five indoor weekend markets, hothouse lettuces rub shoulders with farmstead cheeses, salad dressings, artisanal breads, nut butters, gluten-free cookies, preserves, dog treats and more - most of them made locally.
Bear in mind that not every vendor listed is at every market every week - and that most supplies are limited.
G&G's Long Island Farmers Market operates two winter markets, and one of the veteran vendors, Sconeheads Gourmet Foods, is offering a free scone to all visitors on Saturday, Feb. 18, in Islip Terrace and Sunday, Feb. 19, in Huntington Station - one to a customer.

LI Yarn Crawl knits together a tour of shops for enthusiasts: 9 local stores offer discounts, demos, prizes, more Knitters, crocheters, weavers, dyers, will see what's new

Abstract: None available.

Full text: You've heard of a pub crawl. Get ready for a four-day party geared to knitters, crocheters and sewing enthusiasts of all stripes to revel in their crafts.
From Thursday, March 30, to Sunday, April 2, yarn crafters can take part in the third annual Long Island Yarn Crawl, a self-guided tour of nine yarn shops offering discounts, demonstrations, giveaways and more.
A TASTE OF YARN
"You get to meet new people, discuss different ideas," says Nora Bohl, an avid knitter and crocheter from Upper Brookville. Her regular haunt is the Knitted Purl in Oyster Bay, but the four-day crawl, she says, is a relaxed and enjoyable way to see what's new in the market at other shops.
Discovering the wide variety of yarns is a real draw for afficionados - as is seeing a wide range of what can be done by fiber artists.
"There are some shops that sell their garments," says Toni Andersen, whose Port Jefferson boutique, the Knitting Cove & Yarn Shop, is hosting a few notable yarn makers and dyers, such as Groovy Hues Fibers and Lambstrings Yarn. But other shops, she says - "they do weaving, they do spinning, they do needlepoint and needlework."
Unique to the Island's yarn shops, Long Island Livestock Co. in Yaphank doubles as a working fiber farm, raising and breeding llamas, alpacas and other animals to be sheared.
These days, lap looms for weaving textured wall hangings from assorted fabric scraps are very hot, says owner Tabbethia Haubold. "They're fun. They're easy. They don't require a lot of materials," she says.
Also easy to learn, notes Haubold, is needle felting - using a specialized needle to design two- or three-dimensional figures or crafts.
"That's something that is super simple. All you have to do is be able to stab away at fiber, and watch your fingers," she explains.
SHOP HOPPING
Most of the stores will display samples to show what can be created with needles or a hook and some yarn, says Mary Evanov, 33, of Manhasset, who's joining the crawl for the third year in a row. Each of these shops offers classes for anyone who wants to learn.
"There's so much great yarn right now," says Evanov. "There are all different materials: There's wool, there's alpaca, there's yak, there's cashmere."
Some shops are hosting trunk shows during the crawl, offering shoppers a peek at the newest yarns for spring. Others are offering meet-the-designer events, flash sales, even a wine and cheese party to enjoy the company of fellow crafters. The crawl also features a knit- or crochet-along project with a different piece of the pattern given out at each stop.
Taught as a child to knit by her grandmother, Bohl, who is in her 60s, picked up the hobby again when she retired several years ago.
"It certainly challenges you as you learn the different techniques," she says. "It keeps you on your toes. It's something I completely enjoy, find relaxing. The shops are a nice way to meet people, make friends."

Abstract: Nugent led St. Anthony's all season, scoring 65 points (27 goals, 38 assists) and setting the tone with his extraordinary effort. Held Wantagh's Dylan Beckwith, a fellow honorable mention All-American with 52 goals, to a single assist in a regular-season victory.

MAC O'KEEFE
Syosset, A, Sr.
Even when his final game was all but over and his Syosset team was about to lose to Ward Melville in the Long Island Class A title game, Mac O'Keefe would not quit.
"He ran through that tough Ward Melville defense with no regard for his body to score a goal with 17 seconds left," Syosset coach John Calabria said of O'Keefe's four-goal effort in a 9-5 defeat. "He just wanted to score a goal and keep playing. He loves to play lacrosse."
That passion showed as O'Keefe, a 2016 All-American led the Braves to the Nassau Class A championship, scoring 91 points, including a county-leading 61 goals. In Syosset's 18-12 victory over Massapequa in the county championship game, O'Keefe scored seven goals.
"He was the heart of the team and has been the heart of our program for four years," Calabria said of his two-year captain. "Even though he's a catch-and-finish guy, he did a lot of other things. He's a tremendous rider and forced plenty of turnovers. He practiced like it was the last time he'd ever practice. His leadership and effort was infectious to our team."
O'Keefe will take that enthusiasm for lacrosse to Penn State.
Suffolk player of the year
JARED NUGENT
St. Anthony's, M, Senior
His exit line was a classic: Four goals, four assists and a state CHSAA championship in his last game as a Friar.
"We swept Chaminade. There's no better way to go out," Nugent said after his career-best scoring output sparked an 18-5 victory and completed a rare three-game season sweep of the Flyers.
Nugent led St. Anthony's all season, scoring 65 points (27 goals, 38 assists) and setting the tone with his extraordinary effort. "He was our pulse this year. He played so hard, even in practice and especially in games," St. Anthony's coach Keith Wieczorek said. "He knew only one speed and that was 100 miles an hour. He willed us through some games with his intensity and his energy. On any 50-50 ball, if he was near it, he'd come up with it."
Of course, there was talent to accompany that work ethic. "He's a gifted two-way midfielder. Lefty-righty, an excellent shooter," Wieczorek said. "He distributed the ball well and saw the whole field. He was tenacious on ground balls and in transition and scored a lot of open-field goals."
He plans on doing that next year at Villanova.
The All-LI team
GERARD ARCERI
Smithtown East, F/O, Sr.
A game-changer with his strength and skill on faceoffs that ignited the Bulls' devastating fast break. "Every time I go out there, I think I'm going to win it," said the Penn State-bound Arceri, voted an All-American. Teammates called him their MVP. He even scored 11 goals off the draw.
ZACH BARRETT
Lynbrook, Sr., D, Sr.
Lockdown defender who guarded opposing team's top scorer, also helped the offense with his clearing ability, contributing 13 points. Held Wantagh's Dylan Beckwith, a fellow honorable mention All-American with 52 goals, to a single assist in a regular-season victory. Committed to Binghamton.
BLAKE CARRARA
Riverhead, D, Sr.
He could easily have been overlooked because the Blue Wave was a .500 team that just missed making the playoffs. But Carrara was a force in every game with his lockdown defensive skills and athleticism. Scored four coast-to-coast goals and committed early to play at Maryland.
LUCAS COTLER
Syosset, M, Sr.
This All-American helped Syosset win the Nassau Class A title with his solid all-around play. He was a goal-scorer (31), feeder (23 assists) and ground ball magnet who rarely left the field. Scored four goals in a 13-12 regular-season victory over Massapequa. He will play at Yale.
JOHN DAY
Ward Melville, D, Sr.
Part of the impenetrable wall of defenders that made the Patriots such a tough opponent. He was a ground-ball machine, especially in the postseason as Ward Melville won Class A county and Long Island championships before losing, 7-5, to unbeaten Victor in the state final. Day will play at Army.
MATT GAVIN
Manhasset, A, Sr.
Honorable mention All-American possesses a hard, accurate shot that produced a team-best 44 goals, even though he missed four games with an injury. Totaled 57 points. Scored three goals and added two assists in Nassau Class B semifinal victory over Lynbrook. Committed to 2016 NCAA champion North Carolina.
JACOB GIACALONE
Sachem North, G, Sr.
This Johns Hopkins-bound All-American was a dynamic last line of defense. Playing behind an inexperienced defensive unit, Giacalone averaged more than 14 saves per game, including 17 in a season-ending playoff loss to powerful Smithtown East. Skilled with the stick, he is athletic in the open on clears.
CHRIS GRAY
Shoreham-Wading River, A, Jr.
Earned All-American honors and led the Wildcats to the Suffolk and Long Island championships. He led Long Island in goals (79) and Suffolk County in scoring (101 points) and excelled against the best competition with 14 goals in five playoff games. Committed to Boston University.
MATT LICCIARDI
Cold Spring Harbor, M, Jr.
He was a key to the Seahawks' second straight state Class C championship with his magic sticks (faceoff and field). Scored 20 goals with 33 assists and was clutch in playoffs, scoring five points in each of county final, state semifinal and state final games. Committed to Cornell.
TOMMY McPARTLAND
Farmingdale, A, Sr.
Nassau County's leading scorer with 101 points displayed perfect balance to his game with 51 goals and 50 assists. This All-American, who will play at Mercy College, had big games in the playoffs with eight points vs. Oceanside and four goals in a tough loss to Massapequa.
JOE TIERNEY
Bethpage, A, Sr.
This honorable mention All-American was Nassau County's second-leading scorer with 97 points, including 50 goals. In two playoff games, he scored seven points (three goals) in a victory over Oceanside and five goals plus an assist in a last-second loss to Lynbrook. He is headed to Marist.
RYAN TIERNEY
Massapequa, A/M, Sr.
Added strength in the offseason and that helped him fight through double-teams to score 49 goals. Also improved his passing game to notch 26 points for the Nassau Class A finalists. An All-American with outstanding stick skills, Ryan will play for his father, Seth, at Hofstra.
NASSAU COACH OF THE YEAR
Steve Finnell Garden City
Guided Trojans through season-long adversity (five early losses, key injuries, suspensions, death of beloved former star) to a late 11-game winning streak and a Class B county championship.
SUFFOLK COACH OF THE YEAR
Jay Negus Ward Melville
Rode airtight defense for much of season then beamed as offense blossomed in postseason and Patriots won Class A Suffolk and Long Island titles before losing heartbreaker in state final.

College Board: SAT testing at LI, NYC schools postponed: Students will be able to take current exam , not 'new' SAT, at later date Connetquot says Feb. 20 makeup, during winter break, poses problem

Abstract: According to College Board's website, the exam was postponed at the following testing centers:

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
SAT testing originally scheduled for Saturday at schools on Long Island and across the city and state was postponed because of the snowstorm, test sponsors announced Friday.
Saturday's exam was scheduled to be the final run for the current version of the test before the new SAT rolls out in March.
Representatives of Manhattan-based College Board, which sponsors the exam, said students will be able to take the current version of the test at a later date. Some districts serving as test centers, such as Connetquot, were offered a makeup date of Feb. 20 and have said that may be problematic because it falls during the winter break.
A notice posted Friday on Connetquot's website states: "The College Board has been made aware that this falls during our winter recess, as it does for many New York State schools. We are hoping that the College Board will provide New York State schools with an alternate date for this rescheduled testing. We will provide you with any information as soon as it becomes available."
A College Board representative said, "We always try to work with schools and what is best for them and the students."
More than 351,000 test-takers had registered nationwide for the January 2016 administration. The test centers at schools request the cancellation of the test, and those schools inform College Board.
According to College Board's website, the exam was postponed at the following testing centers: Bayport-Blue Point High School, Calhoun High School and Mepham High School in Merrick, Center Moriches High School, Centereach High School in the Middle Country district, Island Trees High School in Levittown, John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, Oceanside High School, and The Ross School in East Hampton.
At Calhoun, Kennedy, Mepham, Island Trees, Oceanside and The Ross School, a makeup date will be determined. A Feb. 20 makeup date was scheduled for Bayport-Blue Point, Centereach and Center Moriches; that Saturday falls on the final weekend of those districts' winter break.
The redesigned SAT focuses on the few things that matter most for college and career readiness, and it better reflects what students are learning in class, according to College Board.
Changes include a focus on the areas of math that matter most; a move away from obscure vocabulary words to the use of relevant words in context; and an optional essay.
The medical school exam, known as the MCAT, also was postponed, according to the website of the American Association of Medical Colleges. The exam's administration at two sites on Long Island, in Westbury and Melville, was postponed and a tentative Feb. 3 makeup date was set.

LI's Estee Ackerman, 14, competes for Olympics at U.S. Table Tennis Team Trials: West Hempstead teen one of 16 players vying for a spot She's ranked 8th nationally among girls 15 and under

Abstract: The bus picks her up at her home in West Hempstead at 7:15 a.m. and she returns around 6 p.m. At night, the paddle comes out, and Ackerman's transformation into table tennis prodigy is complete. Since she first picked up a paddle six years ago, Ackerman has never fit the mold of a traditional table tennis star.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
By day, Estee Ackerman is a diligent, unassuming, 14-year-old freshman at Yeshiva University High School for Girls in Holliswood, Queens. The bus picks her up at her home in West Hempstead at 7:15 a.m. and she returns around 6 p.m.
At night, the paddle comes out, and Ackerman's transformation into table tennis prodigy is complete. Since she first picked up a paddle six years ago, Ackerman has never fit the mold of a traditional table tennis star.
"I'm training five times per week for multiple hours. When you come home, especially after Yeshiva, it's not easy," said Ackerman, who comes from a family of Orthodox Jews and takes a dual curriculum of general and Judaic classes. "But to me, to be good at anything, you have to put in countless hours.
"I try to do a lot of my homework in the car rides and when I'm at the table tennis clubs, there's breaks sometimes and then I do some work over there."
Ackerman is one of 16 players who will compete in the 2016 USA Olympic Table Tennis Team Trials, which take place Thursday through Saturday at the Greensboro Sportsplex in North Carolina. In order to compete, a player must be a member of the United States Table Tennis Association and must be eligible to represent the United States in the Olympics.
"In sports, anything can happen," said Ackerman, who is the 14th seed, "but I know I'm not a favorite ."
Twelve of the 16 participants are 18 or younger. Rachel Sung, 11, of Campbell, California, is the youngest.
The three-day, single-elimination tournaments that feature some of the best players in the United States will begin Thursday. Three winners - one will be crowned each day - will advance to a North American Olympic qualifier in Toronto in April with a chance to represent the United States in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in the sport more commonly known as pingpong.
"She has a great feel for the sport," Ackerman's coach, Michael Zhao, said.
But Ackerman will have only two opportunities, not three. She said that she will not compete on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath.
In December 2012, Ackerman advanced to the final round of the National Table Tennis Championships in Las Vegas. But when she learned she had to compete on a Saturday, when nonspiritual physical activity is prohibited until sundown, she withdrew from the tournament.
"She's called the Sandy Koufax of table tennis," her father, Glenn Ackerman, said, referring to the Los Angeles Dodgers great who famously refused to pitch in Game 1 of the 1965 World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur. "She's the only member of the United States Table Tennis Association, which numbers 10,000, who was Orthodox. And she gave up the chance to win a championship for her religion."
"Judaism will always be the No. 1 priority for me," Estee Ackerman said.
When Ackerman was 8, her father wanted to find a way to bond with his two children that didn't include electronics. After just a few weeks of playing for fun, "you definitely realized that she could be something great one day," said Estee's brother, Akiva - a 17-year-old a senior at Yeshiva High School for Boys in Woodmere - who also has won at the national level.
"It's similar to the piano," Glenn Ackerman said. "If you sit and practice the piano, day and night, your fingers will know the exact notes to bounce from one to the other. She practiced hours on hours on end."
Estee competed in her first tournament when she was 9 - "They couldn't even see me. I was just a paddle going back and forth," she said - and has been turning heads and attracting celebrity matchups ever since.
She is ranked No. 8 nationally among girls 15-and-under, No. 64 among all U.S. women and won national tournaments in Michigan in 2012 and Las Vegas in 2013. She's beaten tennis star Rafael Nadal.
"He wasn't bad," Ackerman says with a smile. "Pretty good, I should say."
She dominated chef Bobby Flay on the "Rachael Ray Show." She trounced New York Cosmos assistant coach Alecko Eskandarian.
"When I play adults, they find it funny," Ackerman said. "How can a little kid beat the big adults? They never see it coming."
At its core, Ackerman's story is one of family. Her coaches, friends and relatives have her back, win or lose. Olympics or no Olympics.
"My family is the reason I got into this in the first place," Ackerman said, "and their support is my biggest motivation. With them behind me, how can I stop?"

Reader essay: Empty nest without kids, but a full life

Author: Berr, Heidi

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]21 Feb 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767370850?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
In late August, my husband and I became empty-nesters. We sent our second son off to college (our first is a college senior).
I looked up the term "empty nest" at dictionary.com and was surprised to see this: "For parents, the empty nest sometimes results in midlife anxiety." I can't recall ever reading a definition that includes a warning about feelings.
I was excited and optimistic about sending one son off to his final year of college and the other to a smooth, solid beginning. At the same time, I felt nostalgic, sad and anxious about what I might feel in my new life. Yet my anxiety fizzled as I tried new things and learned unexpected lessons:
- Hobbies aren't a panacea. I wanted to become a more experienced cook, so I signed up for a do-it-yourself meal service that delivers fresh ingredients and recipes to your doorstep every Sunday. After a few tries, my head spun from all the dirty dishes, and the time needed to prep the meals was excessive. I plan to sample beginners yoga classes once I get a wave of motivation to try a new hobby.
- Exercise isn't a magic solution, either. Hoping to fill my time with new pursuits, I bravely began a swimming routine in July at the Friedberg Jewish Community Center in Oceanside. I'd always wanted to be able to call myself a cross-trainer rather than someone who simply walks her dogs several miles each day. Yet, by my third week of swimming, I wanted to drown anyone who had the nerve to share my lane, slowing me down and causing me to spend a few extra minutes in this community bathtub. No offense to all you swimmers out there; I wish I'd liked it, but I gave it up after a month and I'm back to simply walking my dogs.
- It's a chance to rediscover the spouse. It is eye-opening to realize that as much as you love and enjoy your kids, the daily giving, listening, etc., use up much of the patience you'd otherwise have available for your marriage.
Once I was no longer amused by my son's hysterical accounts of everyday experiences, I began to find my husband's habits either happily endearing or easier to ignore. We both work in our home, so we frequently occupy nearby space. With no need to pick up after kids and worry over their whereabouts, I have more patience for the piles of paper he leaves around and insists I not throw away, and for the pretzel bags and cereal boxes he leaves out and open after snacking.
- The best plans can be no plans. I'd forgotten the feeling of an entirely unplanned weekend, devoid of "have to" or "need to" activities based on soccer games, college meetings and tours, and more. Once the boys were launched and the dust cleared, I found more time for my spouse and close friends, the luxury of reading for pleasure, and curling up with two dogs who adore me.
So what happens when the kids return home for a school break? In a funny way, it's as if they never left. The first few days of their winter break, I wondered how I managed without the daily hubbub of friends, activity and one kid asking for my car keys while the other wanted to be picked up at 2 a.m. after a night out.
However, as the five weeks drew to a close, I counted the minutes until our home was peaceful again.

Full text:   April 7 is National Beer Day, which Long Island celebrates 365 times a year.
New breweries and craft-beer bars have boomed in Nassau and Suffolk, especially in the last decade, creating a region on tap, with beers local and national pouring in.
"It has been a proven winner," said Amanda Danielson, owner of Hoptron Brewtique in Patchogue, which is awash in high-quality beer at several downtown locations. Danielson, whose establishment is a full-time craft-beer bar, added she expected the growth to continue.
"Long Island can support it," added Vincent Minutella, who opened The Black Sheep ale house in 2011 in Mineola, where O'Donnell's Pub stood for decades. He rotates 25 taps by season, region and style. "Selecting them is 90 percent of my job."
Anthony Celentano, proprietor of Tap & Barrel in Smithtown, considers his work "a labor of love." He oversees more than 50 taps on one of the larger rotating lists. "We print the lists two times a day," he said. "Fresh and local and what the customers like to drink" are his three criteria at the bar, which just celebrated its fifth birthday.
At The Lark Pub & Grub in East Northport, owner Tim Kelly specified, "We're looking for stuff that is a little rare, a little less mainstream, limited releases, what other bars are not carrying" for his 26 taps.
And Chris Werle, co-owner of the Croxley Ales group, which has three major bars in Nassau and one in Suffolk, noted the lists are divided into three sections: classics, including Pilsner Urquell and Guinness; "more cutting edge craft-y beer," such as Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA; and "rotating rarities," of which Pipeworks Lizard King American Pale Ale is one.
Croxley Ales began 27 years ago in Franklin Square. The four Croxley Ales on Long Island add up to more than 250 taps.
Here are some Long Island bars where you can sample what's new and what's news.
The Black Sheep
78 Second St., Mineola; 516-307-1280, blacksheepalehouse.com
The motto at The Black Sheep: "Different is good." And the name, of course, stems from the idea that the black sheep stands out in a herd. Selections are available via 25 taps, 14 growlers and 81 bottles. There are also a half-dozen brews in cans, plus six ciders, just in case. The choices change regularly. The Black Sheep serves hot dogs and bar pizzas. And imbibers are encouraged to bring their own food.

Each of the four bars in the Nassau-Suffolk group of Croxley Ales has a different theme and a wide range of beers. All four advise, "We do not carry Bud, Coors or Miller." The Rockville Centre bar specializes in U.S. beers and is formally titled Croxley's Great American Ale House & Beer Garden. The Farmingdale bar is Croxley's Public House; the first in Franklin Square is Croxley's Original Ale House. And Croxley's Ale House & Biergarten brings to Smithtown a German-style outdoor setting for warm-weather festivities, as well as the indoor bar and dining room that serves sausages and mussel pots, wings and burgers.

On tap, a recent list had Bacchus Flemish Red, Ridgewood's Finback Missing Time Black Saison, Other Half Veldrijden Love Saison from Carroll Gardens, and Anchor Steam California Common. In addition to burgers and chicken wings, the selections include pot stickers, chicken lettuce wraps, chicken potpie, salads, house-made potato chips and a Mediterranean platter of dips, cheese and olives.

Abundant herring a bounty on Long Island in winter: Silver-bodied little fish can be a pickled treat for humans They also serve as a food source for larger predators

Abstract: " "Each spot is different," adds Garrecht, "I like outgoing water early or late in the day at Centerport Mill Dam, Huntington Town Dock and docks in Port Washington and Cold Spring Harbor. Late-night fishing can be good at these places, too." Since herring schools move around a lot, the best way to find them is to check the traditional hot spots once or twice a week.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Give the herring its due. It may weigh less than a pound, but it's one of the most important fishes in the sea.
This simple fish may be best recognized as a pickled treat savored around the holidays or, perhaps, as bait for stripers, blues or even tuna. But these silver-bodied winter visitors also serve as one of the most vital links in the local saltwater food chain. They flood into our bays and harbors by the millions during November and hang around through March, feeding on plankton and smaller baitfish while hoping to avoid being consumed themselves by larger predators.
"They really have a lot of pull for such small fish," says Joey Leggio, 43, a retired New York City fireman from Oceanside and longtime herring fan. "Not in the traditional sense of a tug at the end of a line, but in terms of their drawing power. Atlantic herring are the focus of just about every predator in the sea from diving birds to seals, sport fish to whales."
And that of local anglers who catch thousands of them each winter from Long Island's piers, beaches and bulkheads.MANY REASONS TO FISH
Leggio does most of his herring fishing at Magnolia Pier on Long Beach's bay side. He'll freeze a few dozen to use for bait come spring, but he'll also pickle some for a treat. "Herring are bony," he notes, "but the smaller bones soften up when prepared and these fish taste great. I just bought a smoker, so I'm hoping to try them that way this winter, too."
Joe Cascio, 20, also of Oceanside, loves herring fishing for the fast action. He works at Long Island Outdoors, a rod and gun shop in Rockville Centre, and also frequents Magnolia Pier. He gives most of his catch to family, throws a bunch back and saves a few for bait. He doesn't eat them. "I just like to catch fish," explains Cascio. "On a good day you'll pull herring three, four, five at time. It's a lot of fun."
For Harry Garrecht, 26, of Northport, herring provide a "fishing fix" after most other fish have left the area. "They get you outside and down to the dock, usually with friends you haven't seen since the stripers left town," he says. "It's not so much the catching that's fun as it is the camaraderie. Even if the fish don't bite, I still have a good time."TRICKS OF THE TRADE
Herring are usually caught with spinning rods and multihook rigs weighted by a small sinker or diamond jig. Known as sabiki rigs (available at tackle shops), these feature four or five tiny hooks, each sporting a little bucktail or soft but flashy attractor. Simply jigging the line up and down causes the rigs to shimmy like a school of tiny baitfish - a sight ever-hungry herring simply can't resist.
"The key to success," explains Leggio, "is to not overthink things. Just cast out and jig your rig back with slow lifts of the rod. If that doesn't work, jig slower. If you hook a fish, reel slowly and two or three more should strike the other hooks."
"It's really not hard to catch a bunch of herring," continues Cascio. "The hardest part is finding the fish."
"And warding off the cold," adds Garrecht. "The people who catch best tend to be the ones who dress warmest."
WHERE TO GO
Here's the rub: One of the most abundant fish in the ocean is somewhat hard to pin down. The most important factor in finding them is to figure out which tide they prefer - and that can shift from day to day.
"At Magnolia Pier, the start of outgoing water is usually best," explains Cascio. "If you don't catch then, try fishing any moving water under the lights after dark."
"Each spot is different," adds Garrecht, "I like outgoing water early or late in the day at Centerport Mill Dam, Huntington Town Dock and docks in Port Washington and Cold Spring Harbor. Late-night fishing can be good at these places, too."
Since herring schools move around a lot, the best way to find them is to check the traditional hot spots once or twice a week.
Other consistent herring fishing spots:
- Jones Beach and Captree state park fishing piers
- Sunken Meadow Beach
- Cedar Beach pier, Mount Sinai
- Mattituck Inlet
- Shinnecock Canal as the locks start to open or close.
DO-IT-YOURSELF PICKLED HERRING
Atlantic herring are a great choice for nutrition-conscious anglers. They are high in protein, moderate in fat and an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids. Canned sardines and "kippers" are actually immature herring.
Here's a simple recipe, courtesy of Mark McGowan from Cow Harbor Bait and Tackle in Northport.
Ingredients
4-6 filleted herrings
1 1/2 cups water
1 cup white sugar
1 cup white vinegar
2 teaspoons ground allspice
2 teaspoons yellow mustard seeds
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
2 teaspoons whole white peppercorns
1 small red onion, sliced in rings
2 carrots, cut in thin slices
2 handfuls fresh dill
2 bay leaves
Directions
1. Fillet each herring, leaving the skin on. Cut off the fins.
2. Soak the herring in kosher-salted water for 12 to 24 hours to firm the fillets before pickling.
3. Drain the herring, rinse and pat dry, then cut the fillets crosswise into 2-inch strips.
4. In a saucepan, combine the water, sugar, vinegar, allspice, mustard seeds, caraway seeds and peppercorns.
5. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat and cool the pickling mixture completely.
6. Arrange herring fillets, onion, carrots, dill, bay leaves and horseradish in a glass dish or Mason jar. Pour the cooled pickling mixture into the jar so all the ingredients are completely covered with the liquid.
7. Cover and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days before serving.

LONG BEACH: CITY EYES USE OF SHUT HOSPITAL: CALL TO REOPEN MEDICAL CENTER CLOSED SINCE SANDY TO TREAT VIRUS PATIENTS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Beach city and state representatives are asking the governor and health officials to consider reopening the shuttered Long Beach Medical Center or open a temporary site to treat a growing number of COVID-19 patients on the barrier island.
State Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) and Assemb. Melissa Miller (R-Atlantic Beach) in a March 27 letter to state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker calls Nassau County "a battleground in the fight against COVID-19" and encouraged utilizing the medical center, which has been shuttered since superstorm Sandy.
The barrier island's positive cases have surged past 180, including in Long Beach, Lido Beach, Point Lookout and Atlantic Beach.
"I think the region itself needs to be prepared for more hospital beds in crises like this," Kaminsky said. "Now and in the future, if coronavirus returns in the fall or there are similar pandemics, we should not be scrambling to set up field hospitals after the lesson of the last weeks."
Mount Sinai South Nassau had 321 COVID-19 patients with about 30 ventilators available and about 57 remaining beds at last count Friday.
Officials with the hospital, which purchased the property in 2014, said the state department of general services has made one inquiry about the site but has not expressed interest about reopening the hospital or additional medical services in Long Beach, senior vice president Joe Calderone said.
Two buildings from the original Long Beach hospital remain, but require a new roof, windows, heating and ventilation and still have water standing in the basement, Calderone said.
The Long Beach City Council and Long Beach school board issued a joint statement Friday asking the state to consider reopening the hospital or developing a temporary medical site to treat patients.
"If the former Long Beach Medical Center facility is not a viable option, we stand ready to discuss several other options we believe would suffice," officials said. "We urge the leadership of our state to provide the barrier island with what we need to adequately address our distinctive circumstances in dealing with the challenges of this pandemic."
Mount Sinai South Nassau operates a stand-alone emergency room adjacent to the hospital site, with a separate triage entrance to diagnose patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms, Calderone said.  About 80% of patients report mild symptoms and are sent home to self-quarantine, Calderone said. Any symptoms including trouble breathing or high fever can be transported to Mount Sinai South Nassau's hospital in Oceanside.
After South Nassau said reopening the Long Beach hospital wasn't sustainable in 2016, the state and the Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed to an alternative use plan to allow South Nassau to spend $113 million to fortify its Oceanside hospital and build a $40 million medical arts pavilion at the old hospital.
South Nassau officials said they are preparing to follow the state's plan to send patients to SUNY Old Westbury and Stony Brook. Officials said South Nassau staff was already stretched thin and couldn't support a temporary site in Long Beach.
"It doesn't make sense logistically. This is where the staff is and we have a better chance of treating patients here rather than set up another site," Calderone said. "Unless the federal government wants to come in with the Army and staff to set up another site, it's not practical in this crisi

LI nurses thankful for Schumer's donation: Comedian sent PPE to Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital

Full text: Nurses at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital in Oceanside gathered in an online video to thank Rockville Centre-raised comedy star Amy Schumer for her donation of much-needed protective masks.
"Mount Sinai South Nassau nurses from all departments took a few minutes to thank #AmySchumer for securing a donation of 2,500 surgical masks and 2,500 KN95 masks from #BethennyFrankel and her #bstrong Foundation," the hospital posted on YouTube Wednesday. "Amy's friend, Jen, a nurse at the hospital shared this video."
"We are extremely grateful," says the otherwise unidentified Jen, who is mentioned in Schumer's 2016 memoir, "The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo." Speaking to Schumer, who appears on a laptop computer, she says, "Everybody here has really, really been through a lot the last few weeks, and to know there's people looking out for us, doing whatever they can, makes a big difference. Coming to work, it helps with morale."
Indicating a group of just under two dozen men and women, Jen says, "This is basically all the representatives from Mount Sinai South Nassau that we could get here." Schumer replies, "I'm so grateful to you guys. ... So grateful, I'm so proud to know you, Jen." Jen and the other nurses thank both Schumer and entrepreneur and reality-TV star Frankel's disaster-relief organization BStrong "for making such a difference."
Schumer posted a roughly 30-second longer version on her Instagram account, writing, "This is Jen, my best friend since I was 12 years old. I was able to rush masks to her hospital. This morning we got to thank each other. Link in bio to donate to get masks to emergency workers."
Frankel, who commented with hearts, hugs and kisses on Schumer's post, had written on Instagram on April 2 that BStrong had donated "2,500 KN95 masks, 2,500 surgical masks and 2,500 #CoronaKits (sanitization, hydration, immunity) en route to Mount Sinai South Nassau Mental Health Counseling Centers on behalf of @amyschumer."

FOR JOBLESS-AID SEEKERS, A FRUSTRATING PURSUIT: LIERS SAY THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH ON PHONE, WEB

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sometimes it's just a busy signal. Sometimes a recorded voice says no one's available. And sometimes it's just a quick click, sending you back to square one.
When the coronavirus pandemic largely shut down commerce last month, tens of thousands of Long Islanders lost their jobs, but they took solace in knowing they would qualify for unemployment benefits. 
Getting those benefits has been a formidable test of people's patience. The state Labor Department's process required that many applicants speak to a representative to finalize their paperwork, but the system has been overwhelmed with callers like Barbara Levine of Oceanside.
"Horrendous," said Levine, who said she's been calling for three weeks.
Levine is a person who prides herself on her persistence. She's 89 and still drives, still works and doesn't just take no for an answer.
"I'm very pushy," said the woman who was laid off from her telemarketing job at an insurance company after 22 years on March 13.
Her daughter helped her fill out the online application, but when she got to the end, there was a catch. To be approved, she had to speak to a representative of the Labor Department.
That sent her down a rabbit hole for the next three weeks, calling again and again - 50 times a day - and never getting through.
If anything, the calling has gotten worse, she said. When she started, the phone would ring and a kind recorded voice would say no one was available.
Now it's just the incessant baaa baaa baaa of a busy signal, she said.
"I'm aggravated; this is killing me," she said. "My taxes are coming up. It's $4,000."
The frustration creates another level of stress at a time when people are already worried about encountering some invisible bit of the coronavirus on the next thing they touch. 
Levine is self-isolating in her home and her daughter is bringing in the groceries. But every half hour she's back on the phone, trying again.
"I'm really going crazy," Levine said. "I need the money."
'Infuriating' process
More than 55,000 Long Islanders filed claims for unemployment benefits in the week ended April 4, a 3,715% increase over the number of claims filed the same week last year.
 The state Labor Department received more than 8.2 million phone calls the last week in March, compared with normal call volume of 50,000.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo acknowledged the state's system is failing many people.
"I apologize for the pain - it must be infuriating to deal with," Cuomo said in March.
To meet the demand, the Labor Department said it has used a two-pronged strategy to reduce volume and increase capacity.
To reduce demand, the agency said it is reminding people that delayed claims will still result in them receiving their entire benefit, starting from when they were let go.
The agency Thursday announced it would implement a new application process  Friday that will allow most filers to complete their applications online without a phone call.  Filers in Levine's position are now directed to stop calling and wait for a call from an agency staffer.
'I'm bleeding out'
When David Davidson shut down his vintage guitar store in Farmingdale in mid-March, he was optimistic the business could still get by with online orders.
COVID-19 showed him he was wrong.
"The whole world came to a stop," said Davidson, 56, of Massapequa. 
He's decided not to lay off his three employees, believing "we didn't want to take food out of anybody's mouth."
One saving grace was that he believed he qualified for unemployment benefits, thanks to the expanded eligibility that allowed benefits to the self-employed.
The trouble started as soon as he got online to fill out the unemployment form. He'd get three pages in, and get kicked off. Then he'd get 5 pages in, and the same thing, he said. Finally he completed it over an automated phone line, only to be informed he needed to speak to a rep.
Davidson tried calling three to four times in a row. No luck. He tried calling early in the morning. He did this for 10 days in a row. 
At the same time, he applied for a Small Business Administration loan, but believes that will take weeks to come through.
His daughter, who shares the business with him, is going through the same experience.
"I'm bleeding out," he said, noting he has thousands of dollars a month in expenses. 
'Everything is tight'
When Alisha Koenig isn't making another attempt to get through on the phone to the Labor Department, she's calling the electric company, her cellphone company and credit card company to postpone paying her bills.
"Everything is tight," said Koenig, 35, of Brookhaven, who lost her job in customer services for an interior design company on March 20.
She added, "If it goes into next month, it's going to be super-tight."
As it is, she has her husband and two kids "minimizing everything" - which means turning off lights around the house and skipping splurges at the supermarket.
Her husband is still working as a cooling and heating engineer at a hospital, so the mortgage is being paid. But any extra expense is felt keenly, she said, such as when her 4-year-old daughter, Danica, rolled off the sofa the other day and broke her collarbone, requiring medical care.
The unemployment benefits would help, she said.
"It's crazy," Koenig said. "Some of my friends got into the system and were done in a half hour. This is my third week and I can't get through."
Calling 200 times a day
Nathen Christian's bank account is down to minus-$70, due to some overdrafts.
He's been calling to finalize his unemployment benefits with an urgency close to desperation. He estimates he's been dialing in 200 times a day for two weeks.
Christian, 26, of Coram, was let go temporarily March 18 from his job as a designer of home theaters and lighting systems.
For now, he's looking hard at his car payment, phone bill and car insurance. That's not to mention putting food on the table for him and his dog Emma.
"New York State is spending so much money," Christian said about the expenses associated with coronavirus, "and they don't update the system."
Getting through
Kristyn Lawson finally got through.
The 24-year-old waitress said trying to reach a state Department of Labor employee who could help her apply for benefits was a job in itself.
She worked her last shifts at an IHOP in Farmingdale and a Red Robin in West Babylon on March 14.
After sitting in front of her computer for days refreshing the screen more times than she can count, she was able to submit her application online. 
She's already received two unemployment payments, each $419.
"It's a bit frustrating because I know at work, I could make that much money or more in two or three days," she said. "It's helpful but it doesn't come close to covering all of our expenses."
Her boyfriend, Josh Campbell, 20, also a restaurant server, applied for benefits at the same time Lawson did but has yet to receive any payments.
The two live together in a two-bedroom apartment in West Babylon for which they pay $1,800 a month.
"Our livelihoods were tips," she said. "With restaurants closed to the public and with everything that's going on with the virus, I felt upset .... scared. Everything was taken away from us. But of cours

Full text: High school seniors missed out on a milestone this spring - as proms across Long Island were canceled and postponed - leaving students who had already purchased their attire wondering what to do with their glamorous gowns and high heels. But with the arrival of socially distant photo shoots, dress buy-and-sell groups and virtual celebrations, many Long Islanders are making sure no one forgets about prom amid the pandemic.
Party on? 
Senior Annika Wakefield, whose school Earl L. Vandermeulen High School is known for hosting elaborate, themed proms on its campus, expected to wear her dress to a gymnasium transformed by the efforts of parent volunteers. The school has hosted its proms on site since 1957, creating the likes of Peter Pan's "Neverland" and Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Now, she says she'd be happy with any kind of prom. 
"Unfortunately, the reality is that we still don't know what we're doing," says Elisa Scott, one of the prom committee chairs. Scott, whose son is a senior in the district, says the parents had to remove all of the supplies from campus in March. This included 300 sheets of cardboard and plenty of paintbrushes. She adds the volunteers were about "a quarter of the way" into the process, which begins in October and has parents painting, building and planning the prom until June. "We are keeping our options open, whether that means we do a more traditional kind of prom or if we do something nontraditional, some kind of gathering for seniors as long as it's safe before they go away to college," she says
Wakefield bought her dress for the now-postponed occasion back in March from Merrily Couture, a boutique in Mount Sinai. It was the first dress she saw when she walked in - the scarlet gown has intricate beading across the bodice and a floor-length tulle skirt. "I really liked it," says Wakefield, 18. "I thought, 'I'll try that one on,' and I also brought 12 others into the dressing room with me."
But her heart was set on that first choice. Wakefield says she's hoping to pick it up soon in case her prom is rescheduled for this summer. That's the hope of many seniors who haven't yet gotten an official word on if their milestone will be moved. 
In the tight-knit community of Shelter Island, the junior class had been working hard leading up to the big night previously set for May 30. It's since been canceled, with plans to reschedule up in the air.
Michelle Corbett, the junior class adviser, says since there are only about 75 students in the entire high school, all grade levels are invited to the prom every year. Her daughter Angelina Rice would have attended her first prom this year as a freshman.
Rice picked out her dress from the Ask Alice Boutique in Oceanside: a backless, royal blue gown with a train.
"By the time it arrived, the shutdown had begun and the store was closed," Corbett says. "Someone from the store contacted me, and my sister, who lives in Oceanside, was able to go pick up the dress from the woman's house."
With a dress secured and nowhere to go, students in Rice's situation may feel helpless. But they have a few options.
Capturing the moment
For those who don't want to part with their prom dresses just yet, there are local photographers still looking to capture the special moments and fashion from a social distance - no prom necessary.
Darya Bradshaw, of Kings Park, posted on her photography Facebook page that she's offering discounts for any student who would like to star in a prom photo shoot. She wrote: "If you have your dress, let's make the most of it!" The photo shoots will be held outdoors, and Bradshaw says it wouldn't be necessary for her to get any closer than six feet from her subjects.
"I want to make girls feel better about missing out on something they look forward to," says Bradshaw, who has been working as a professional photographer since 2014. "I'm hoping these photos do that. Even if they can't go to prom, they can put on their dress and get all dolled up."
Nancy Sinoway, who owns Nancy Sinoway Tailoring And Alterations Studio in Port Washington, is offering "social distancing" appointments in her shop for dress alterations, and prom photo shoots, dubbed "Prom on Main," with a professional photographer. The photo shoot setup is outdoors and includes an old school Volkswagen Beetle and vintage furniture, says Sinoway. There is more information, along with an appointment request form, on her website, nancysinoway.com/prom-on-main.
"The response has been amazing," Sinoway says. "If there's a demand, then we'll do this through the Fourth of July."
Virtual celebrations
There is another chance to dress your best: a virtual prom.
Jen Forman of Charlotte's Closet in Port Washington hosted a nationwide, virtual celebration on May 9, which saw close to 2,000 attendees, Forman says. Her daughter, Charlotte Forman, 17, who attends Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, was among the Long Island teens who participated in the celebration from their own houses. She wore a black, cutout maxi gown.
Still to come is the LGBT Network's annual prom, which will be held virtually this year. It will be live-streamed across social media platforms with DJs, performers and LGBT youth sharing their stories on June 19. 
"Our prom, which is traditionally attended by upward of 400 Long Island youths, now has the potential to reach thousands of youths across the country," says David Kilmnick, CEO of The LGBT Network.
The prom is free of charge, and as always, the goal is for kids to have fun and "just be themselves," Kilmnick says. More information can be found at LGBTNetwork.org.
Say yes, or goodbye, to the dress
Others may already be looking for ways to find a new use for their dresses. 
The Long Island Dresses and Prom Buy and Sell Facebook group has gotten an "increase" in members and posts since the pandemic began, says Jessica Blanchard, the group's founder. She created the group in 2016 so Long Islanders could buy and sell formalwear locally. "The group ranges from all ages," Blanchard says. "There are wedding dresses, mother-of-the-bride dresses, baby christening dresses. It's a whole community."
Blanchard says though parties have been postponed, the group has still served as a resource - and sales have been made - for people looking to repurpose prom accessories for events like weddings later in the year.
Of course, many schools and local organizations are holding onto hope for making a memorable prom night happen from a distance.
Karen Sambursky is this year's co-chair of Gambol, which is Paul D. Schreiber High School's prom celebration. In the middle of the Port Washington school's fundraising efforts, "everything was put on hold," Sambursky says, "or canceled, because here we are in the great unknown."
While they wait to make new prom plans, parent volunteers have placed "Congratulations Class of 2020" signs on the lawns of 390 students as a surprise. Sambursky feels sad for the students, and going forward she wants to figure out exactly what kind of prom they'd want to make it more special.
"It's not set in stone," she says, "but [the prom organizers] have talked about hearing what kids want and how they would feel coming back to a party at Thanksgiving. It's very different. We'd envision it as more of a homecoming party. We want them to be able to come back and be happy and excited."
She adds some students are saving their dresses for weddings and future occasions, while others may just keep them

HEMPSTEAD TOWN: STEMMING THE TIDE OF COSTS: TOWN ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE A MORE EXPENSIVE FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM

Full text: Mike Cascio thought the worst of the storm was over after repairing his Oceanside home that took in a foot of water during superstorm Sandy.
Since then, Cascio has been told he needs to elevate his home and his flood insurance premiums have doubled.
"I was fortunate I bought my flood insurance when my house was not in a flood zone and I bought a low risk policy," he said. "The premium has doubled in 10 years. I can only imagine people paying more than me getting hard hit."
Cascio and thousands of others on Long Island's South Shore face flood insurance costs that could increase under a new risk rating program that was recently shelved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency until 2021.
The Hempstead Town Board is asking Congress to revise the National Flood Insurance Program to ensure premiums stay affordable for homeowners along the Island's coastal communities.
The town board unanimously passed a resolution last week opposing the reauthorization of the flood insurance program's proposed changes for risk ratings and urged Congress to "instead seek meaningful affordability protections." 
The resolution came a week after the Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed to delay risk rating changes until 2021, but board members said the program will hurt residents who are still rebuilding and others who face substantial damage assessments. 
"The Town Board believes it is imperative that Congress include in any reauthorization legislation a significantly lower cap on annual percentage increases for all NFIP premiums," the resolution states.
FEMA's proposed changes of "Risk Rating 2.0" would calculate a homeowner's flood insurance based on several factors, including the home's distance to water and the cost to rebuild a home.
Town officials said the program would increase rates by 18% annually until they reach actuary rates, and premiums may double every four years.
"I think that everyone who lived through Sandy and its aftermath would agree that changes need to be made," Councilman Anthony D'Esposito said. "That being said, we need to ensure that whatever changes take place are in the best interest of our residents and do not make it impossible to remain in their homes."
FEMA postponed changes amid criticism from town, state and federal officials, including Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. FEMA officials said in a statement this month that they would conduct a "comprehensive analysis of the proposed rating structure so as to protect policyholders and minimize any unintentional negative effects of the transition."
The town board also passed a separate resolution seeking data from FEMA of substantially damaged homes after the storm. Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen's office sent letters in March to 13,000 homeowners notifying them of damage designations, but the town is requesting further information from FEMA.
Cascio was told his home was significantly damaged and needed to be raised last year, years after repairs were already made. He challenged the Town of Hempstead's building department and now is not required to raise his home.
"Homeowners who may have been substantially damaged by Sandy, but were never properly noticed on their responsibility to repair and elevate by prior administrations, face a perfect storm of devastating flood insurance premium hikes," Gillen said.
National Flood Insurance Program Risk Rating 2.0 Changes postponed until October 2021 Proposed changes would increase rates to primary homeowners up to 18% annually until they reach their actuary rates and every four years premiums may double. Rates based on factors, including the home's distance to water and the cost to rebuild a home. Sourc

LI's Stepanek gold standard: Most outstanding swimmer among all local winners

Author: Kersich, Peter

Abstract: None available.

Full text: ITHACA, N.Y. - There is one word that comes to mind when describing Northport senior Chloe Stepanek: winner.
Stepanek captured the state and Federation titles in the 200-yard freestyle and 100 freestyle Saturday for the third consecutive season at the girls swimming state championships at Kelsey Partridge Bird Natatorium on the campus of Ithaca College.
In winning those two events, Stepanek was named the Most Outstanding Swimmer of the meet for a third straight year.
"It's truly an honor and very humbling. You have so many other great swimmers here," Stepanek said. "I never go into an event saying 'I'm going to be the MVP' because you never know what can happen."
Stepanek broke her own state record in the 200 free with a time of 1 minute, 46.15 seconds. The previous record (1:46.73) was set at the county championships Nov. 9.
"I was hoping to get under that 1:46 mark, but I still broke my own record and went a best time," Stepanek said. "You have to appreciate best times when you see them."
She even surprised herself with her pace in the 100 free.
"I wanted to go under 49 [seconds], and I was stunned when I saw 48.76 pop up on the board. My jaw almost hit the floor," Stepanek said laughing.
Oceanside senior Catherine Stanford repeated as the state champion in the 50 free, also winning the Federation title with a time of 22.84, breaking her own Nassau record of 22.92 set at the county championship. She also placed second in the 100 free with a personal-best time of 49.94.
"It's really sad knowing that this was my final meet because I love Section VIII, I love my home and love Long Island, but I am really excited to see what the next journey brings," Stanford said.
Port Jefferson senior Kyra Sommerstad and Commack sophomore Denise Phelan also captured state and Federation titles.
Sommerstad successfully defended her crown in the 200 IM (2:02.17) and Phelan won the 100 breaststroke (1:02.33), breaking her own Suffolk record (1:02.65) she set at counties.
"I look forward to coming up here every single year. It's sad that it's over now, but it's something I'll never forget," said Sommerstad, who also finished second in the 100 backstroke in her fifth state tournament appearance.
"The fact that I was able to swim better than my time is awesome," Phelan said. "I worked on some little things after the preliminaries, and it helped me improve my time."
Sacred Heart freshman Cavan Gormsen earned the Federation title in the 500 free with a state record time of 4:46.75, besting the previous record set by Lindsay Stone of Pittsford in 2016 by .05 seconds. She also keyed the Sacred Heart 400 free relay team to victory in the final event of the championship.
The Spartans set the tone in the first event of the day when their 200 medley relay team of Tess Howley, Joan Cash, Gormsen and Ariana Brattoli finished first and broke the state record (1:42.21). The previous record of 1:43.21 was set by Long Beach in 2016. Cash was a member of that Long Beach team when she was an eighth-grader attending Long Beach middle school.
"We train together every day and we are really a tight-knit group, it feels great to break the record with them because truly deserve it," said Cash, who placed second in the 50 free. "I'm just happy I get to keep my name up there on the record board."

Full text: Three years ago, we watched our friend do a roller-skating show. The theme was "Around the World." We liked it so much, we joined the Oceanside Department of Community Activities roller skating program, and we have been roller skating with each other ever since!
Grace's favorite thing about roller skating is doing the shows, and Olivia's favorite thing is roller skating with her friends. We got our first skates at Play it Again Sports in Oceanside. The great thing about them is that, when you grow out of your skates, you can bring them back and get a credit toward new skates.
Learning so many moves makes skating even more fun, and it helps when it is showtime! Space was the theme of last year's show. We worked on the dance and our song was "Lucky Star" by Madonna. We get to wear really cool costumes. They also had a big blow-up alien as part of the props.  In addition to participating in the show, we love to go to the roller rinks.

He batted .431 with 31 hits, including five home runs, and drove in 29 runs. He hit safely in 20 of 22 games. A St. John's commit, Schwartz did not allow a passed ball, and threw out 10 of 19 base runners. BRENDAN TURTON Clarke, P/3B, Sr. Turton was not only the Rams' ace, but also provided senior leadership that helped a relatively young Clarke team capture the Nassau Class A championship. He was 9-2 with one save and a 0.57 ERA. In 74 innings pitched, he allowed 51 hits and 24 walks while striking out 87.

Full text: A man with a history of mental illness was shot and killed by Nassau police Tuesday night inside an Oceanside home after he charged at them with a samurai sword, Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said. 
The shooting, just after 6 p.m., came after officers responded to a disturbance call made by the man's father, Ryder said.
Two officers arrived at the home in the 2600 block of Columbus Avenue and went inside to find the father and son involved in an altercation, Ryder said.
"The son was very distraught," the police commissioner said at a news conference near the home. "He had knives in his hand. Then he dropped those knives and he picked up a samurai sword."
The 36-year-old man, whom police did not identify, refused repeated demands from officers to put down the weapon, Ryder said.
"The officers gave orders to 'drop the weapon, drop the weapon, drop the weapon,' Ryder said. "He continued to come at our officers and the officers had to use deadly, physical force to stop the individual."
He died at a hospital, Ryder said.
The police commissioner said the man had a history of mental illness and was receiving treatment.
"The father was the one who called us," Ryder said. "We came here looking to help that family out, and it ended the way it ended."
Both of the officers who first encountered the man fired their weapons, according to police officials.
"The dad was very supportive, understood, and said the officers did everything they could. ... before they had to fire that weapon," Ryder said. "It's a tough job. We stand by our officers. Tonight is another testament to the hard work they do."
Four officers, including the first two on the scene, were hospitalized Tuesday night, Ryder said. Another officer was injured in a vehicle crash responding to the home, Ryder said. A fourth officer suffered an injury while doing CPR on the man shot by police, the commissioner said.
The first two officers at the home also responded to Monday afternoon's fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old boy at an Oceanside strip mall.
"Both of these officers were the second and third car at the scene last night at the stabbing," he said.
The officers were distraught, Ryder said, and underwent treatment for trauma Tuesday night at a hospital. 
"It's a tough situation that everybody was involved with," Ryder said. "The officers did everything they could."
As investigators huddled in the middle of Columbus Avenue behind yellow police tape, a phalanx of emergency vehicles lining both sides of the tree-lined street, neighbors and onlookers gathered nearby but declined to c

A happy return for Gabriella: Heimbauer, back from torn ACL, leads Massapequa

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gabriella Heimbauer leaps, swings and lands gracefully. With what the 6-3 senior had to go through to get back to this point, that much is impressive.
Considering how long it took her to get back on the court, the outside hitter for Massapequa is just happy to be back doing what she loves. Crushing volleyballs.
She led a balanced Massapequa attack with 10 kills in the Chiefs' 25-12, 25-8, 25-11 home win over Oceanside in Nassau AA/B/C-I on Thursday night, pounding set after set into the hardwood.
"Best feeling in the world," said Heimbauer, who didn't play volleyball as a junior because of an ACL injury she sustained as a sophomore during the Nassau Class AA girls volleyball championship game. "It's really nice to come back from something this hard. It's just incredible."
The issue, she said, came in strengthening her quad.
"It took a long time for my quad to get built back up, so I had to kinda just buckle down for over a year just trying to strengthen up this every single day," she said.
Heimbauer managed to play a bit of basketball last year, but now she's back healthy for volleyball - and Massapequa's better for it. The Chiefs improved to 4-0 thanks to Heimbauer and her sophomore sister Alessandra, who had six digs, five kills and three aces. Alexis Panagoulias added four kills, and Meghan Kirtyan had 17 assists.
While the balanced Chiefs played nearly error-free, it was the Heimbauer sisters who stole the show. When one swings, the other cheers. When one makes a mistake - a rarity - the other is there for encouragement.
That was how they acted during Gabriella's recovery, too.
"My whole family helped her throughout the whole thing with everything," Alessandra said before Gabriella quickly chimed in.
"She helped me the most with everything around the house," she said.
Even when her older sister needed help with the most remedial task, Alessandra did it willingly, Gabriella said. Now that her sister is healthy, Alessandra said Massapequa has found a spark.
"At first, it was very difficult to see because I know she's such an amazing player," she said. "But then to see her back on the court just brought back that energy that we all needed."
The energy was evident early, as Gabriella's first kill split the back row of Oceanside (0-3) for an easy point. Even during a rigorous recovery, she didn't lose any of that signature power.
A power that could lead Massapequa to a county championship.

Lawyers: Unaware of knife: No weapons were brought to brawl, teens say

Full text: Lawyers for some of the teenagers facing gang assault charges after a fight ended in an Oceanside High School senior's stabbing death said Tuesday their clients didn't know anyone had brought a knife to the scene.
Some of the seven Long Beach youths who are facing second-degree gang assault charges in connection with the Sept. 16 brawl appeared in Mineola court Tuesday after making bail following their arraignments Saturday.
A grand jury already has indicted Lido Beach resident Tyler Flach, 18, on a second-degree murder charge and a weapon offense for the fatal stabbing of Khaseen Morris, 16.
Flach, who has maintained his innocence, is in jail without bail and has yet to be arraigned on what remains a sealed indictment.
Those facing the felony assault charges include two 16-year-old males whom police haven't named, along with defendants Haakim Mechan, 19; Marquis Stephens Jr. and Javonte Neals, both 18; and Taj Woodruff and Sean Merritt, both 17.
Attorney David Haber, who was appointed Tuesday to represent Mechan, said after court his client didn't know "anybody was bringing a weapon or had any intention to use a weapon against the deceased."
Woodruff's attorney, Donald Rollock, echoed Haber's comment, saying his client had "absolutely no knowledge" of anybody bringing a knife to the scene.
"This was a simple fight escalated by one individual who took things way too far," Rollock said.
Lawrence Carrà, Neals' attorney, said: "They went for a fistfight and it resulted in the possibility of facing 15 years in jail, for nothing that they did."
Stephens' attorney, William Kephart, said after court that no indictments had been handed up naming his client or any of the others arraigned Saturday.
He added that his client, a Long Beach High School graduate, "had no weapons" and "had nothing to do with any involvement with the deceased."
Attorney Dennis Lemke, who represents Merritt, confirmed that his client hadn't been indicted and said he was a Long Beach High student with "good grades" and no prior arrests.
Police have alleged the defendants were active participants in the attack at a Brower Avenue strip mall in Oceanside, which also left a 17-year-old male with a broken arm and a head injury.
Police previously said Flach was among a group of males who charged at Morris and his group of friends and a melee ensued in which Flach plunged a knife into Morris' chest, piercing his heart.
The violence broke out after Morris went to the location knowing that the ex-boyfriend of a girl he was friendly with wanted to confront him, according to police. Morris' family said he texted the ex-boyfriend to say he wasn't dating the girl but had walked her home from a party.
Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said Tuesday in an interview following the court appearances that she wouldn't comment on the evidence as prosecutors continue looking at video of the brawl and talking to witnesses.
"When we have the opportunity to share more after indictments are filed, we will ... It's not smart for us to comment on how we think the case will go until a grand jury has heard all the

Fun ways to fundraise: LI schools come up with creative ideas to raise money for programs, activities

Full text: Pink flamingos on your front lawn? A pie in the principal's face on Pi Day? A chance to opt out of fundraising campaigns guilt-free? Some schools on Long Island have gone beyond the bake sale to come up with creative fundraisers. Here are five examples:
"You've Been Flocked!"
Elementary schools in the Oceanside School District have created a flighty fundraiser - for a $20 contribution, anybody can have a friend or family member be surprised by a flock of a dozen plastic pink flamingos mysteriously appearing on their front lawn for 24 hours. "It's so unexpected to see these crazy flamingos all over your lawn. It was so much fun, such a nice surprise," says recipient Fran Perpero, 48, a marketing director whose daughter, Sophia, 11, is a sixth grader at Oceanside School 5. "My daughter was all excited. She was jumping up and down taking pictures." The money raised goes toward the sixth grade's annual overnight trip upstate, says Amy de la Teja, a parent running the fundraiser at School 5. That school picked up the idea after School 3 launched it; School 8 has also now jumped on the bandwagon. Teams of parent volunteers "flock" two houses per evening Sundays through Thursdays, leaving a sign that informs the homeowner, "You've been flocked!" with the name of the school. The following evening, they collect the birds and transport them to their next location. Think a dozen flamingos isn't enough? For $30, the teams will leave two dozen birds.
Paying It Forward
At East Lake Elementary School in the Massapequa, students are literally paying it forward. For the first time this year, the school is trying a fundraiser using an online platform called Raise Craze, which has the tagline "Fundraising Through Kindness," says Danielle Ocuto, a parent who is organizing the effort. "When the program is kicked off, students are encouraged to create a page for themselves on the site," Ocuto says. There they will described three acts of kindness they intend to carry out, and designated family and friends will receive an email asking if they would like to respond to the children's kindness by helping them out with a donation to their school, Ocuto says. The PTA gets 90 percent of each donation during the Nov. 4 to Nov. 15 campaign, Ocuto says. Daniella Pedote, 9, an East Lake fourth grader, is already cooking up her potential acts. "I would play with someone who is alone; I would let someone go in front of me in line at the grocery store; I would bake for the Ronald McDonald House for sick kids," Daniella says.
Pie Face!
March 14 is Pi Day, celebrated on 3/14 each year because 3.14 are the first three digits of the mathematical constant that every schoolchild learns. But Pi has more than 31 million digits after its decimal point - and at Dawnwood Middle School in Centereach, the Junior National Honor Society combines an educational pursuit with a fundraiser. Sixth, seventh and eighth graders compete in an after-school faceoff to be the one to recite the most numbers of pi, paying $1 each for the chance, says Leah Fitzpatrick, PTA president. "Every year there's these kids who are so amazing," Fitzpatrick says. "One student memorized like 57 numbers, which kind of blew my mind." Each student who participates gets to "pie a teacher" with a whipped cream pie; the winner gets bragging rights as well as the opportunity to throw a pie at the principal, who is dressed in a garbage bag and goggles, with a much larger pie with a cherry on top, Fitzpatrick says. The students who participate are then given a pizza "pie" party.
A Win-Win-Win
In the Plainview-Old Bethpage School District, several elementary schools are addressing the need to be cognizant of children's allergies, the desire of students to celebrate their birthdays in the classroom, and a chance to raise money for the PTA in one fell swoop with the Birthday Box. At Judy Jacobs Parkway Elementary School in Plainview, for instance, parents can pay $25 and order a bin delivered to the classroom that includes approved snacks such as Oreos or Pirate's Booty for all, waters, and a certificate and pencil for the birthday child, says Kara Kaplan, PTA co-president at the school. "It's been a great fundraiser for our school," says Kaplan, who placed her own order for her daughter Emma's third grade class when Emma turned 8 this September. "It's a convenience for the parents, it's all kind of done for them."
Checking Out
Sometimes you just don't want to participate in the drive for cash. Nichol Vanore, PTA co-president at Eugene Auer Memorial Elementary School in Lake Grove, says her anti-fundraiser has been a hit. Parents are bombarded with requests each fall (not only from schools but from sports teams and other extra-curriculars) to sell wrapping paper, bake cookies and such. So Vanore sent home a lighthearted flyer offering parents the opportunity to opt out of fundraising by writing a check for $25, $50 or an amount of their choice. "It's what parents really do feel on the inside. They wish they could just write one check and people would leave them alone," says Vanore. "You only need so many tchotchkes, and everyone buys their wrapping paper in the dollar store." After spotting a similar fundraising flyer on a Facebook site, she revamped it and sent it home. "We were shocked that the first time we sent it out, we raised $1,800," Vanore says. "It really came out of me seeing a jokey thing on Facebook. I thought, 'I'm going to give everybody a way to be guilt-free for the rest of the school ye

Full text: "Never forget" is a phrase that has been part of our lexicon since the Holocaust, and more recently we also have attached it to the horrific 9/11 terror attacks.
We should never forget atrocities that have affected humankind. We should revere our soldiers and police officers who consistently work to prevent another 9/11-type tragedy. We should never forget. I will never forget.
I also will never forget the outpouring of humanity that came after the terror attacks, or that in the aftermath people viewed each other as humans. We did not consider race, religion or sexual orientation in our relationships with one another. We were one.
Then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a model for what a leader should be in a time of crisis. He was calm and asked us not to attack each other, saying that Christians, Jews and Muslims all went to work that day, just to do their jobs. We needed to direct our anger at the perpetrators, he said. Did we forget?
Today, we live in an ideologically divided country. I am a Democrat, and the reason I am is because of ideology. What I am not is someone who will hate others for their beliefs. How can I? How can I hate half the country, half of my relatives or half of my friends? We argue, sure. But, I still love them.
There are many Republicans I admire in my community. Should I hate any of them because of their ideology? I will argue with many of them that a woman should receive pay equal to a man, that assault weapons should be banned and that people of any sexual orientation should be allowed to serve in the military. I may go home shaking my head with frustration, but I won't go home with hate in my heart.
We align ourselves with politicians based on our views. These people may not have the purest motives at heart (start rolling your eyes). Why should many of them spark division? We are too similar in our needs and wants to let them do this to us.
We can't forget. We can't forget that we are all human. And we shouldn't wait for the next natural disaster or mass shooting to realize that. "Never forget" that we are one.

Shake-up in makeup: Ulta and Sephora adding LI stores; e.l.f. chain shuts 5

Full text: When it comes to retail cosmetics competition on Long Island, you win some, you lose some.
The two largest specialty cosmetics retailers in the nation - Sephora and Ulta Beauty - are each adding two new stores on Long Island as part of their nationwide expansions this year. But small chain e.l.f. Cosmetics last month called it quits for its brick-and-mortar stores, taking out five local shops with that decision.
The shake-up can be blamed on the economy, one consumer goods expert said.
Sephora will open 35 stores in 32 cities this year, including locations in Oceanside and Lake Success, the retailer announced Monday.
Sephora, which is owned by French luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and has U.S. headquarters in San Francisco, is not yet disclosing the addresses where the new stores will be located.
"At Sephora, we are constantly working to further enhance, personalize and simplify the omnichannel experience [shopping in stores and online] for our clients, so the connection between the physical and digital is virtually seamless and highly customized at every touch point," Mary Beth Laughton, executive vice president of omni retail at Sephora, said in a statement.
The chain sets itself apart by allowing customers to sample a wide range of makeup and skin care products and offering customized services, said Alison Gaither, an analyst in beauty and personal care at Mintel, a London market research firm with a U.S.  base in Chicago.
"They really provide this kind of idea that [employees] need to apply a product to everyone who walks in," she said.
There are more than 460 Sephora stores across the Americas, and 660 locations inside J.C. Penney department stores. Seven Sephoras are on Long Island, two of which are in J.C. Penney stores, in Westfield South Shore mall in Bay Shore and at the Roosevelt Field mall in Garden City.
On Feb. 26, e.l.f. Cosmetics, a budget brand of makeup, closed all 22 of its stand-alone stores, including five on Long Island at Westfield South Shore mall, Smith Haven Mall in Lake Grove, Plainview Shopping Center, Roosevelt Field mall, and Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station. It plans to focus on selling its products on its website and in national retailers' stores, according to its quarterly financial report. 
Rite Aid, Walmart, Target and Ulta are among the retailers that sell e.l.f. products.
Founded in 2004, Oakland, California-based e.l.f. (the letters stand for eyes, lips, face) started as an e-commerce brand, and its 22 stores contributed only 5 percent of its $267 million in net sales in 2018.
Instead of major revenue drivers, the stores "were viewed more as a showcase, a way to have a place where consumers could stop in and see and touch ... and purchase the product," said Linda Bolton Weiser, a senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co., an investment banking firm in Montana.
Meanwhile, Ulta, which has salons in its stores, including 11 on Long Island, is moving ahead with its previously reported plans to open two new local stores this year - in Bridgehampton Commons this summer and South Port Shopping Center in Shirley in the fall.
As of Feb. 2, Ulta had 1,174 stores nationwide, and it plans to open 155 more by the end of fiscal year 2020, the Illinois company said.
A strong economy is a factor in the beauty shake-up, as both Sephora and Ulta sell prestige,  or high-end, beauty products, though Ulta offers a mix of price points, Weiser said.
"Women will trade up and splurge and buy the prestige products," she said.
The U.S. prestige beauty industry reached $18.8 billion in sales in 2018, a 6 percent increase from its sales in 2017, according to the NPD Group, a Port Washington market research firm. But within the prestige industry, makeup, the largest category, grew only 1 percent to $8.1 billion in sales in 2018. Skin care sales in the prestige industry increased by

Millennials overcome hurdles to launch businesses

Author: Herzlich, Jamie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jillian Weston started her online marketing company in 2013 when she was just 23.
At the time, she recalls going to networking meetings and often seeing only older entrepreneurs.
"It was sort of a lonely experience," said Weston, whose firm, Jillian's Circus, is based in Oceanside. "When you go to traditional meetings, there's not a lot of younger people there."
So she started her own millennial business group, The Unicorn Network, in 2016.
"I wanted to hang out with people in the same position as me and support each other and help each other grow," said Weston, now 30.
The group started with about 10 members and now includes more than 350 millennial entrepreneurs between two chapters in Long Island and Manhattan.
Statewide, there were 21,198 firms owned by 25- to 34-year-olds in 2016, up slightly from 21,188 in 2015, according to the latest Census figures.
While launching a business always presents challenges, young Long Islanders face two extra hurdles: the high cost of housing and high college debt.
Local millennials - defined as those born between 1981 and 1996 by the Pew Research Center - are not forming new households at the rate their age group did in prior decades, according to an August report by the Long Island Association business group. In 1970, 86.4 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds on Long Island were heads of their own household (either renters or owners living independently). By 2016, that number had dropped to 36.5 percent, the report found.
That could hinder business startups considering many entrepreneurs borrow against their homes, said Matt Cohen, vice president of government affairs at the LIA.
Many millennials said they have to rely on personal savings, help from friends and family and credit cards.
In addition, the younger generation is battling high debt loads out of college, Cohen said.
The estimated average student loan balance for students on Long Island was $35,140 for 2018, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Federal direct student loans average about 5 percent interest for 10-year terms, which results in monthly payments of approximately $372. Payments can vary depending on the type of repayment plan.
But in general this type of debt load can make it difficult to start a business, Cohen said.
Weston said she was lucky in that she didn't carry debt out of college and that helped in being able to launch her business.
"I was very blessed," she said.
Ubaid U. Bandukra, 30, owner of Caffeine, a coffee shop in Oceanside, and a member of The Unicorn Network, also cited the lack of student loan debt as a major boost.
"I was lucky enough not to have college debt," he said. "If I had ... all of my savings would have gone to repay it."
While college loans make it harder to be an entrepreneur, they don't make it impossible.
Lindsay Plotkin, 24, co-owner of Syosset-based LD Decor & Design, an interior design and real estate staging firm, graduated from Molloy College in 2016 with about $30,000 in debt.
She works full time as an administrative assistant for a company that provides phone systems to businesses, which helps her pay down the college loans, and spends 25 to 30 hours a week co-running her business.
She met her co-owner and business partner, Danielle Riggio, through The Unicorn Network, noting the group has "really inspired me."
Beyond the financial considerations, launching a business requires risk tolerance. That's something many would think comes easier for younger entrepreneurs, but that's not always the case.
Jason Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, an Austin,Texas-based millennial and Gen Z research firm, said millennials often say they want to start their own businesses, but are "more risk averse than other generations."
That's because millennials on the older end of the spectrum entered adulthood around the time of the Great Recession, he said, noting many struggled with unemployment or underemployment.
"It was a very jarring experience," Dorsey said. "It made them sensitive to taking risk."
Bandukra said having a father who started his own convenience store business "gave me the courage to do the same."
Even with his father as a mentor, starting a business is "a lot of hard work without any recognition," he said.
But there are upsides for young entrepreneurs as well.
It can be argued that younger people - often with fewer life commitments - are better positioned to take the entrepreneurial leap than older people with mortgages and children to support.
Also making it somewhat easier today is technology, which has allowed businesses to operate virtually anywhere and reach a much broader audience.
"Millennials are definitely more comfortable with the newer technologies than previous generations because it's all they've known," said Dorsey. In addition they have more diverse lending options with access to nontraditional capital such as online crowdfunding and microlending for smaller loans, he said.
Still, to be successful, they have to do their due diligence as would any entrepreneur, said Aaron Foss, founder of Mount Sinai-based Nomorobo, a robocall blocking service and an entrepreneur-in-residence at Hofstra University in Hempstead assisting students with their business ideas.
Key basic business principles apply, such as doing your market research, making sure you're solving a real problem and making sure you have enough finances to cover the lean times, he said.
When starting off, regardless of age, you should have enough capital to cover 18 months of personal and business expenses, Foss said.
"That should give you enough runway to have a shot at making it work," he said, noting it also pays to find mentors and people to help you along the way.
"The best team might be a good mix of older entrepreneurs and millennial entrepreneurs," he said, because they each bring a different perspective.
To be sure, there are business groups for entrepreneurs both young and old, as well as for millennial professionals. For instance, the Long Island Association has a young professionals committee made up of about 40 people roughly aged 22-35 that meets every four to six weeks to discuss issues relevant to them, Cohen said.
Beyond networking, getting your psyche ready before leaping into entrepreneurship is important and that means being willing to take chances.
"Where there's risk there's a ton of reward," said Marcus Damas, 29, founder of Fueled by Culture, a creative marketing agency that in January relocated its headquarters from Bay Shore to Manhattan. "If you're too comfortable you're not growing and your company is not growing."
Damas, who played professional basketball in Sweden for two seasons, decided to take the leap in early 2017.
He said it's hard work, but he has no regrets.
"I think it's the best thing I did," he said. "It's a great time to be an entrepreneur."

Rezoning for housing: Hempstead aims to revitalize some industrial areas

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Hempstead Town Board unanimously approved on Tuesday a sweeping rezoning of the areas north of the Inwood and Lawrence train stations that will enable developers to build hundreds of new apartments in what supporters hope will become lively, walkable neighborhoods. 
The board voted 7-0 to approve the rezoning, which town officials and residents said could help revitalize the flagging industrial and commercial areas and ease the shortage in the area of affordable housing for young people and seniors.
"It's always been underutilized, desolate and, quite frankly, dangerous after hours," said Bobby Chawla, a Lawrence resident and one of many members of the public who spoke at the meeting in support of the rezoning. "I'm super-excited to see this initiative go through, to see what this area can become."
The two rezoned areas extend north from the train stations along Doughty Boulevard and Lawrence Avenue, respectively. The new zoning code, which was spearheaded by Councilman Bruce Blakeman, allows for buildings of up to five stories and 60 units per acre next to the train stations, receding to three stories and 14 units per acre farther from the transit hubs. Ten to 20 percent of the units would be affordable, with prices ranging from 60 to 100 percent of the area median income.
The town paid Cameron Engineering & Associates of Woodbury $367,400 to draft the new zoning code.
Another new, higher-density housing development also moved through the town's legislative process on Tuesday, with the board voting 6-1 to approve site plans for a four-story 230-unit apartment building in Oceanside.
Councilman Anthony D'Esposito, who represents the district, cast the lone dissenting vote.
"I had some concerns about the application," he said. "There were some community concerns about traffic and there were concerns brought up if Nassau County will continue a bus route on Rockaway Avenue."
Some Oceanside residents have previously expressed wariness about the project, but no members of the public spoke for or against it at Tuesday's meeting.
Also on Tuesday, the board voted 7-0 to approve capital plans for the next five years, including a $61.1 million capital plan for 2019.
This year's plan includes:
$36.5 million for road improvements
$5.9 million for water districts in Uniondale, East Meadow and elsewhere
$3.8 million for new fire trucks for the Merrick Fire Department
"Based on the input we received from residents over the last year, the priority was clear, which was more funding for our roads," Supervisor Laura Gillen said at the meet

Reign delay for Mepham softball

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Mepham softball team's pursuit of a county title will need to wait another day because of forces beyond its control.
With two outs in the top of the seventh inning and Mepham batting, plate umpire Jack Kisilinsky ordered the game to be suspended with heavy rain and more expected in the forecast. Mepham led Division, 10-2, in Game 2 of the Nassau Class A championship Thursday at Hofstra.
Mepham, which leads the best-of-three series 1-0, scored three runs in the seventh inning on errors and wild pitches.
"The pitcher for Levittown Division could not get the grip of the ball, even though I'm switching the balls out," Kisilinsky said. "It was two wild pitches in a row. Pitchers, infielders and outfielders are having problems with the balls."
The game will be resumed at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Hofstra for the final four outs with Mepham at the plate with two outs and no one on base. The Pirates would win the Nassau Class A championship with a win Friday. If Division rallies, Game 3 would be Saturday at Hofstra.
"We don't want to see them hurt because whoever wins, they go on to play another game," umpire Tom Cully said. "And to have somebody lose somebody stepping on a bag or making a double play and pull something because we're trying to push a game through, it's not fair."
Top-seeded Mepham (20-2) took a 7-2 lead in the sixth inning on a pinch-hit, three-run triple from Dominique DeLutri. Stefanie Simone, Brianna Morse and Gianna LaSpina each added two hits for the Pirates. Delaney Haley had two hits for No. 3 Division (15-9).
And with a championship on the line, the umpires said they wanted to protect the safety of the players.
"Not fair to the kids," Kisilinsky said. "Not fair to anyone else."
Oceanside-East Meadow moved back. The first game of a best-of-three Nassau Class AA championship between No. 2 Oceanside and No. 1 East Meadow was rained out. Game 1 will be at 2:30 p.m. Friday at Hofstra.
The game will be resumed at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Hofstra with Mepham, up 1-0 in the best-of-three series, leading, 10-2.

Full text: NORTH BABYLON
A proposal to build 40 apartments next to a North Babylon elementary school has cleared a major hurdle, securing a zone change from the Babylon Town Board.
Developer Robert Curcio Jr. is seeking to construct four buildings on a 2 acre-parcel at 766-768 Deer Park Ave., calling the development Parkway Village Estates.
The town board, at a special meeting June 15, voted to change the zoning to Multi-Residence from E Business on part of the parcel and B Residenc. The vacant parcel was formerly a gas station
In May, the Babylon Industrial Development Agency voted to give Curcio a $3.5 million property tax break over 30 years to construct the apartment complex.
Residents have complained at several town public hearings that the development, next to Marion G. Vedder Elementary School, would bring additional traffic to Deer Park Avenue and neighboring streets, and possibly be a hazard to students going to and from school.
The proposed development still needs site plan approval from the Babylon Town Planning Board, as well as other town and county approvals.

NORTH HEMPSTEAD
The North Hempstead Town Council has approved a second contract with Bohemia-based P.W. Grosser Consulting so the company can perform soil testing on the I-Park soccer fields in New Hyde Park.
The $14,160 contract comes two months after the town approved a $4,500 contract for a radiological investigation. Under the new contract approved June 18, Grosser officials will create a soil sampling work plan, collect soil samples and submit a report on the sample results.
The state Department of Environmental Conservation in November closed the soccer fields after finding slightly elevated radiation levels. Martin Brand, a department deputy commissioner, said in November that the radiation levels "do not pose a threat to public health."
Part of the land where the soccer fields sit had been a Unisys Defense Systems Corp. facility. Under Unisys, workers dumped chemicals into dry wells and theyt eventually seeped into groundwater. DEC officials mandated a $32 million cleanup plan in 2015.

RIVERHEAD TOWN
The Riverhead Town Board has cleared the way for a pre-school and child day care facility at a town-owned recreational building at Stotzky Park.
Board members voted 4-1 at their June 18 work session to approve the license agreement of Kiddie Fit Community Learning LLC to use 1,258 square feet of the building on Columbus Avenue. Town officials have previously said parents have needed a local day care option and having Kiddie Fit use the building would help address that need.
Councilwoman Jodi Giglio voted against the measure, saying she didn't agree with the town's lease price of $1 per square foot.
"A dollar-per-square-foot is unheard of anywhere, in any town," Giglio said.
Councilman Jim Wooten, who voted in favor of the measure, said he was satisfied with the research the town attorney's office had put into comparable square footage rental for the facility, and that mostly local children would be using the day care program.
JEAN-PAUL SALAMANCA
HEAD OF THE HARBOR
Head of the Harbor Village Police officials said they will step up patrols on Highland Avenue after residents cited speeding vehicles that threatened people and pets.
"Cars think it's a 55-mile-per-hour drag strip," said Linda Rosasco, who added the problem appeared to have worsened after recent road improvements filled in potholes. Drivers appeared to be using the road as a cut-through from Nissequogue Village to Route 25A, she said at a June 19 village board meeting.
David Schmidt said he worried that "someday I'm going to get run over" while walking along the road. "We pay taxes to live in peace," he added.
Village police chief Charles Lohmann said the department would deploy one of its electronic speed signs and increase enforcement on Highland Avenue. The stepped-up enforcement won't be permanent because the department typically has only one officer at a time patrolling the entire village, but it may not need to be, Lohmann said: "Word does get around pretty quick when summonses are issued."
Village officials are trying to reduce speeding on other village streets by asking New York State to lower the speed limit on Route 25A and by installing another one of the electronic speed signs near Harbor Country Day School on Three Sisters Road. The village bought four of the signs this spring.
NICHOLAS SPANGLER
HEMPSTEAD TOWN
Town of Hempstead officials have added a sign at Oceanside Park with steps on how to protect children with food allergies.
Similar signs are to be placed in all parks and playgrounds maintained by the Town of Hempstead over the next month.
The signs ask park visitors to eat only in designated picnic areas, gain permission from a child's guardian before any food is shared with that child, and wash hands with soap and water or a wet-wipe after eating. The signs also include a reminder that hand sanitizer does not remove food allergens.
"This is about awareness," Councilwoman Erin King Sweeney said in a statement. "I don't believe that anyone would intentionally do something that would put a child at risk, so we are really just bringing this issue to people's attention."
Particles of a food allergen can be spread throughout park equipment if children's hands are not cleaned appropriately, as food does not necessarily have to be eaten to cause a reaction, according to a town news release.
The idea for the allergy-friendly signs came after an Oceanside family asked the town raise awareness at local parks and playgrounds, Councilman Anthony D'Esposito said.

Scammer got $45K, cops got clear picture

Full text: Did he prey on fear and compassion only to be undone perhaps by a home security camera?
Nassau police said an 81-year-old woman who lives in Oceanside was scammed out of three payments totaling $45,000 by a man who claimed her son had been arrested after he was involved in a car accident.
Police on Tuesday released clear images of the suspect - caught on the victim's surveillance system - that authorities hope lead to his arrest.
"I want everybody in the community to realize this could be their mother, and I want them to go viral with this and send it everywhere until we can hunt this guy down, and we get him, and we put him in jail," Nassau police Commissioner Patrick Ryder told reporters, according to a News 12 video.
Nassau police joined other authorities, including the state tax department, in issuing alerts on Tuesday warning residents to beware of telephone callers demanding cash for relatives or friends whom they claim have been arrested or kidnapped.
Anyone who receives such a telephone call should hang up at once and call 911, they said.
The state tax department also warned it never collects tax payments in person and that "phishing" emails requesting personal information should be deleted without ever clicking any of their links.
The advice came one day after the U.S. District Court for the Southern District issued similar warnings against scammers who try to extort cash or gather personal information for identity theft.
The Oceanside scammer collected the first $7,500 cash payment from the victim, who arranged to meet him at her home after he told her it was for her son's bail, according to the police.
He scammed the second $7,500 in cash by telling her the bail was raised, they said.
Then the scammer, who drove a dark four-door Honda, came up with a third scheme, according to police.
He told the victim a pregnant woman was hurt in the crash and had lost her child, police said. The victim was told her son's records would be expunged if she handed over $30,000 in cash to cover the woman's medical bills, and she made that payment too.
Anyone who might help the detectives solve the crimes should call Nassau County Crime Stoppers at 800-244-TIPS. All callers will remain anonymous.

Some guys stole hearts on Valentine's Day. Nassau County police say Joseph Ravenell stole packages.
Ravenell, the latest suspect arrested in a crime trend attributed to thieves known as "porch pirates," is charged with seven counts of petit larceny, all in the theft of packages from homes in Rockville Centre, Oceanside and South Hempstead on Wednesday, police said.
Ravenell, 26, of Martin Luther King Drive, Hempstead, was arrested after being caught on video surveillance "removing packages from several residences and placing them into a maroon Chevrolet Monte Carlo," police said.
The thefts occurred on Columbia Road, Harvard Avenue, Hempstead Avenue, Terrell Avenue and Dartmouth Street in Rockville Centre, as well as on Cedar Street in South Hempstead and Windsor Place in Oceanside.
Police did not disclose the items taken or their value. It also was unclear if any of those items were recovered.
Ravenell was scheduled for arraignment Friday in First District Court in Hempstead.

MANHATTAN

A manager for an energy company that hired Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ex-aide Joseph Percoco's wife as part of an alleged bribe scheme testified in Manhattan federal court Friday that she was "subpar" and "sloppy" preparing an elementary school energy curriculum for $90,000 a year.
Yanina Daigle, an assistant to Percoco co-defendant Peter Galbraith Kelly, an executive at Competitive Power Ventures, said that Lisa Percoco taught only 19 half days over a 22-month period after the curriculum was developed for the company's community outreach program.
Prosecutors said it was a "low show" job designed to line the pockets of Percoco, 48, of South Salem, Cuomo's longtime right-hand man, in return for favors - one of two bribery schemes allegedly set up by lobbyist Todd Howe for his clients.
Daigle testified that Lisa Percoco was a good teacher, but made more than either co-workers or successors, refused to help in extra social media efforts to build the program, and either was late for work-related conference calls or took them in her car or "at the pool."
At Kelly's instruction, she said, Percoco's name and likeness was kept out of brochures and publicity materials, and was called "Miss Lisa" by students to avoid revealing the link to Cuomo's aide "because it could have been interpreted the wrong way."
Percoco and Kelly contend the hiring was based on friendship and wasn't a bribe. The trial resumes on Tuesday.

A truck hit a pedestrian bridge over Hempstead Turnpike at Hofstra University Friday morning, officials said.
There were no reported injuries in the crash, which occurred at 8:18 a.m. just west of California Avenue on the border between Hempstead and Uniondale, Nassau County police said.
The bridge, which connects Hofstra facilities on both sides of Hempstead Turnpike, was closed for several hours, but reopened late morning after an inspection, a school spokeswoman said.

A thief stole money from four vehicles in New Hyde Park in the span of 19 hours, Nassau police said Thursday in asking for the public's help to catch the person.
The culprit struck between 3 p.m. Tuesday and 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, and it was not immediately clear if the thief was male or female, police said.
On Campbell Street, the thief got money from a gray Ford Suburban, a gray BMW and a blue Hyundai, police said. A gray Nissan on Tulip Lane was also hit, police said.
Other details were not immediately available early Friday morning.
Third Precinct detectives ask anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at 800-244-8477.

Hempstead officials speak out against Wantagh swastika

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two Hempstead Town Council members are speaking out against the person who drew two swastikas onto a Wantagh street less than a week after the same symbol was found spray-painted on a sidewalk in Oceanside.
"We are greatly disturbed by tonight's discovery of a swastika on a Wantagh sidewalk," read a joint statement issued by Councilwoman Erin King Sweeney and Councilman Dennis Dunne, who represent Wantagh.
"Our township is home to those who endured the horror of Nazi death camps and many who fought the atrocities of the Nazi regime," the statement said. "There is no place in our communities for this symbol of hatred and intolerance."
Nassau police said First Squad detectives are looking into the bias incident, which came to the attention of a Brent Drive homeowner who noticed the swastikas on the sidewalk in front of her home just before 3 p.m. Tuesday.
The discovery comes after community leaders in Oceanside blasted the vandal who painted a swastika on a sidewalk there on Feb. 21.
On Thursday, Town Councilman Anthony D'Esposito joined residents, Jewish war veterans and rabbis to encourage anyone with information about the first incident to contact police.
Detectives request that anyone with information regarding the incidents contact Nassau County Crime Stoppers at 800-244-TIPS. All callers will remain anonymous.

Full text: Difficult to deal with Able-Ride on phone
My father lives in Oceanside and suffers from a traumatic brain injury, so he qualifies for the Nassau Inter-County Express Able-Ride service that provides door-to-door transportation for adults with disabilities. However, it has become nearly impossible for him to rely on this service.
Staff who run this transportation pride themselves on understanding the special care needed for adults with disabilities, yet the Able-Ride phone service misses the mark. When my father attempts to make an appointment with Able-Ride, he is sometimes disconnected or left on hold. Some workers don't understand the severity of my father's injury and get frustrated when he asks them to repeat themselves.
Something needs to be done so that adults with disabilities get better care.

Tax e-cigarettes as a tobacco product
As the State Legislature works toward a budget, the health of all New Yorkers must be a priority.
This is a challenging budget year, but to reduce health care costs, we must focus on keeping people healthy. That includes combating smoking, which is still a primary cause of preventable death.
We also must do more to address kids using e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. Kids are enticed by these products because they come in candy flavors and often at low prices. It's time to increase taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products, which have not been raised since 2010, and to include e-cigarettes. Including this in the state budget would help deter young people from using these products and would generate new revenue.
It's time to tax all tobacco products equally and use this revenue to invest more in our tobacco-control program to educate about and discourage tobacco use.
Robert Stolberg, East Meadow

Love Story: Alan and Cindy Bergman, of Port Washington

Full text: Alan Bergman of Port Washington recalls the unusual way he met his future wife, Cindy.
My wife picked me out of the phone book. In 1984, Cindy Bergman, her maiden name, was employed as a Wall Street stockbroker with Shearson Lehman Brothers. On the hunt for new clients in that pre-Internet era, she decided on a unique marketing strategy of searching the White Pages for individuals with the same last name as her. This would serve as a conversation starter and an instant bond between her and the prospective client. She looked for Bergmans who lived in nearby neighborhoods in the event she had to make a home visit to explain various investing options.
Her search yielded one Alan Bergman, me, who lived in Brooklyn Heights, just a few blocks from her Cobble Hill residence. She called me to introduce herself. I then received an invitation in the mail from Cindy to a seminar on IRAs, a new product at the time, being held at the Waldorf Astoria. We met at the program, shook hands and exchanged a few pleasantries. I attended another seminar that she invited me to, taking a friend along this time. When he asked me about Cindy, the thought instantly occurred to me to ask her out on a date. I called her the next day and she agreed to go out with me.
Over dinner the following weekend at a Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn Heights, we had a surprisingly long, frank and candid conversation about our lives and aspirations. We learned the unfortunate coincidence that we had both recently lost our fathers, who had each passed away at age 57. We also realized that our fathers, both from the Bronx, had mutual friends. We wondered if they had ever met each other. I think that we left that date somewhat startled at how atypical a first date it actually was.
Cindy was 27 and I was 29. She grew up in Oceanside and I was originally from Westchester.
Our relationship was on fast-forward from that point on. Each time Cindy Bergman called me at work, my secretary thought she was a family member and always put her call right through.
On March 3, 1985, less than a year after that first date, we were walking down the aisle of the Oceanside Jewish Center as husband and wife, Alan Bergman and Cindy Bergman-Bergman.
That year we left Brooklyn for Port Washington, where we have lived ever since. After the birth of our two sons, Cindy went back to school and received her master's in audiology from Hofstra University. She is an audiologist with I Love Hearing in Port Washington and also a health coach for Optavia. Since 1981, I have run my family's graphic arts firm founded 96 years ago by my grandfather. It is now Gutenberg Graphics in Long Island City.
Cindy and I celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary last week with a weekend stay in Manhattan, where we took in a couple of shows and visited some museums. There have been a few unexpected bumps and traumas along the way - our second house in Port Washington burned to the ground a week prior to our moving in - but it has truly been a most-excellent lifetime together. And, when both families get together, there are plenty of Mrs. Bergmans in the room. Not only did Cindy get a new client, she took him for all that he's worth!

Full text: A Rockville Centre teen has been charged with drunken driving Monday in Oceanside with a 15-year-old boy in the back seat of the car, Nassau County police said.
There were no injuries.
Ryan Powers, 17, of Chestnut Street, was charged under Leandra's Law with aggravated driving while intoxicated, endangering the welfare of a child and driving while intoxicated, police said. He was scheduled for arraignment Tuesday at First District Court in Hempstead.
According to police, a 911 call was received shortly before 6:30 Monday night reporting an auto accident on Oceanside Road.
When police got to the scene they found a 2005 Nissan Maxima sideways in the middle of the street with the driver, Powers, nearby.
"The officers observed the defendant to have bloodshot eyes and slurred speech and smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage," a police news release said.
Police said Powers was arrested and then taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. The 15-year-old was released to a relative.
A police spokesman said Powers had been involved in an accident with another car that was also at the scene when police were called, but details of the accident were not immediately available.

My Turn: Family day out without our phones was a good call

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Like many of today's preteens, my grandchildren were brought up surrounded by technology. Their iPhones are as much a part of them as their clothing. I have driven in the car with them in utter silence as they navigated through games such as Subway Surfers or Candy Crush Saga on their phones. My questions were answered in short sentences while their minds were elsewhere.
During Christmas vacation, I planned to take them to Manhattan to see "School of Rock" on Broadway. It would be our special day: the ride on the LIRR, center orchestra tickets to a great show, and dinner at a fine restaurant.
Although we see each other frequently, I wanted this day to be a bonding experience.
Shortly before leaving for the station, I asked them to please leave their phones at home. They looked at me in utter disbelief! You would have thought I had asked them to go without pants. However, after a moan or two, they reluctantly agreed.
While we were standing on the LIRR station platform, Abby asked me how long it would be until the train arrived. I reached into my coat pocket for my phone, but it wasn't there. I checked all my pockets, slacks, and purse to no avail. I had forgotten it.
I must admit that I did have a moment of panic: I'd be in New York City with two children and no quick means of communicating either with my husband or daughter, and they had no way to get in touch with me.
But the moment was short-lived and soon we were sitting in the train. Idan asked me a question and for some reason I acted out the answer. This led to a good laugh and a game of charades. Then we tried to recall to whom a certain person was married. That led to a game of funny matches. For example, if Lady Gaga married Tom Brady her name would be Lady Brady.
After much amusement, we arrived at Penn Station. As we walked to the theater and passed a souvenir shop, Abby suggested we buy a camera since we had no iPhone with which to take photos. It was a great idea, and we purchased a disposable camera for a few dollars.
The show was terrific. We had a fabulous prix-fixe meal, and then proceeded to walk back to Penn Station.
On the ride home we talked about our day, our favorite moments, and which character we liked best in the show.
The day was a huge success. Perhaps we should leave our devices home more often.
Marlene Willard,
Oceanside

VALLEY STREAM
Probation for podiatrist
in illegal oxycodone sales
A Valley Stream podiatrist who had admitted to conspiring to illegally distribute oxycodone was sentenced yesterday to 3 years of probation.
Dr. Stephen Owusu, 62, wrote more than 450 prescriptions for oxycodone to people who were not his patients between March 2009 and July 2011, and charged $300 for each prescription, according to federal authorities.
Owusu also admitted in U.S. District Court in Central Islip that he knew that people filled the prescriptions and then sold their pills on the streets of Long Island and Brooklyn.
On Feb. 18, 2014, Owusu pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute oxycodone.
U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Wexler said Owusu had completed 2,400 hours of community service and was entitled to the sentence he had been promised.
Yesterday, in an interview after the sentencing, Owusu said that since his arrest, he has lost his job and his home and is living in a halfway house. Although Owusu said he can continue to treat patients, he cannot prescribe medication. That has hurt his ability to earn a living. "That makes you completely ineffective as a doctor," he said.

Abstract: The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports that seniors 85 and older make more suicide attempts than any other age group. Clarson, who is Asian-American, filed a retaliation and discrimination lawsuit against Long Beach, alleging she was fired for testifying to a grand jury about alleged criminal activity of a city council member, and that the city "subsequently hired a less qualified, white male to fill her former position," according to a 2015 appellate decision dismissing Clarson's complaint.

Village to connect
restrooms to sewers
Amityville Village has hired a company to help connect beach restrooms to Suffolk County's Southwest Sewer District.
The village has contracted with Nelson & Pope Engineers and Surveyors of Melville to perform preliminary work related to moving the toilets from a septic system to a sewer connection. The contract is for $24,300.
The restrooms are on Amityville Beach at the end of South Bayview Avenue. The beach has two sets of toilets, officials said: one at the pavilion that is already connected to the Southwest Sewer District, and one on the beach, within yards of the Great South Bay, that is connected to an old septic system. That system is near capacity, said village trustee Nick LaLota, prompting the need to connect to the sewer system.
"We're definitely going to have a problem with that in the future," if it isn't connected to the sewer, said trustee Dennis Siry.
LaLota said the village has already been in contact with Suffolk County and has been assured that the system can handle the additional capacity. The village still needs to seek official permission from the county to connect to the sewer district and will seek grant money to pay for the connection, LaLota said.

Nogid out as city
controller; Clarson in
Jeffrey Nogid's tenure as Glen Cove City controller ended on Dec. 19, after less than six months on the job.
The City Council on Dec. 27 voted to hire Sandra Clarson, a former Long Beach comptroller, to replace Nogid. Clarson is to be paid $135,000 a year, $5,000 more than Nogid. She also will serve as assessor at no additional pay.
City spokeswoman Lisa Travatello declined to comment on the reason for Nogid's departure, including whether he resigned or was fired.
"The city does not comment on personnel matters," she wrote in an email, adding that "Mr. Nogid's last day was the 19th. The Council was informed the next day."
Nogid did not return phone calls for comment.
Like Nogid, Clarson served as the comptroller for the City of Long Beach. She was comptroller from 2005 until 2012 after serving more than two years as an accountant and then deputy comptroller, city records show.
Clarson, who is Asian-American, filed a retaliation and discrimination lawsuit against Long Beach, alleging she was fired for testifying to a grand jury about alleged criminal activity of a city council member, and that the city "subsequently hired a less qualified, white male to fill her former position," according to a 2015 appellate decision dismissing Clarson's complaint.
Clarson served as auditor for Garden City from July 2015 to July 2016. Her resume reports she worked most recently as an assistant controller and project manager for Brooklyn-based StaffCo, a staffing agency. She holds a bachelor's degree from Queens College, where she majored in accounting and information systems, according to her resume.

LINDENHURST
School board to study options for Bower
The Lindenhurst Board of Education is expected to vote today on the formation of committees to help decide the fate of a shuttered elementary school.
The question of what to do with Edward W. Bower Elementary School on Montauk Highway has been looming since a public referendum in October, when voters roundly rejected a proposition by a developer to build senior condos on the site of the school. Bower was closed in 2011 because of the building's age and declining enrollment. Since then, portions of the building have been rented to several groups, but maintenance costs continue to climb and the building this year is expected to cost the district nearly $206,000.
The board is expected to bring forth a resolution at today's meeting allowing for the creation of three committees to explore the future of the building: one for the sale of the property, one for renting it and one for repurposing the property. The committees will likely comprise volunteers from the community. Board member Kevin Garbe said the committees are expected to act as "think tanks."
The meeting is at 8 p.m. at the McKenna Administration Building, 350 Daniel St.

NORTH HEMPSTEAD
Septic system care
urged for clear water
The Town of North Hempstead is urging its residents to maintain their home wastewater systems to keep waterways clear.
Residents who live in unsewered areas of the town can sign up with a local initiative called Get Pumped! Long Island, which instructs homeowners how to regularly care for their cesspool or septic systems.
"Something as simple as the proper maintenance of a home wastewater system can make a big difference in what contaminants get into our drinking water and our bays and waterways," Supervisor Judi Bosworth said in a news release.
Get Pumped! Long Island is a partnership of various municipal committees and the state, and is offering a $50 rebate for wastewater system service.
Every home generates wastewater, which eventually migrates down to water aquifers and coastal waters. Proper system maintenance can help keep groundwater clean and save homeowners money in the long run, according to the release.

Welcome to the family: These 10 Italian restaurants serve portions big enough for the whole clan

Abstract: House specialties aside, most of the Island's family-style Italian spots have similar menus, with appetizers (baked clams, fried calamari, antipasto platters, stuffed artichokes) hovering around $20; pastas (marinara, clam sauce, frutti di mare, alla vodka) and mains (Parms, Marsalas and Franceses of chicken and veal, chicken scarpariello, shrimp scampi) $25 to $35, though steaks and chops usually run a bit higher.

Full text:   "When you're here, you're family," claims a well-known national chain. But Olive Garden has nothing on Long Island's homegrown family-style Italian restaurants, where countless thousands of hungry diners share enormous platters of linguine and clams, veal Parmesan, clams oreganata, Caesar salad and other stars of the Italian-American repertoire.
The first family-style Italian on Long Island was La Parma in Williston Park, which opened in 1984. Owners Tony Gralto and Dominick Gregorio were veterans of Don Peppe in Ozone Park, generally regarded as the first family-style restaurant in New York City.
"Don Peppe was a little hole in the wall," Gralto said, "with a menu hanging on the wall. They served a lot of athletes and celebrities but no matter who the customer was, it was 'You sit over there! You sit over there!' I had a lot of customers who came from Long Island and I figured if I opened a place like that and was a little nicer, it would be a hit."
And it was. Gralto and Gregorio opened three more La Parma locations, and over the next three decades, family-style Italian restaurants multiplied all over Nassau and Suffolk.
For old-timers like La Parma and Piccola Bussola, virtually nothing has come off the menu. But plenty has been added. "Our original menu probably had 20 items on it," said Tony Lubrano, whose family owns Piccola Bussola locations in Huntington and Mineola (as well as La Bussola in Glen Cove). "Now it's grown to 80 or more." He observed that "what an Italian restaurant served 30 years ago is now what most pizzerias serve. We have to keep current." That means not only adding grilled salmon and burrata, but more vegetarian-friendly and gluten-free options, as well as the ubiquitous zucchini noodles for those avoiding carbs.
There's no family-style restaurant that doesn't also serve individual portions - though each are typically big enough for two. Many operators have found that while family-style rules on weekends, weeknights attract smaller parties who eschew belly-busting. "During the week we have couples coming in for a casual dinner," said Leonard Oliva, co-owner of Ciao Baby in Commack and Massapequa Park. "And we have plenty of folks who are sitting at the bar, watching the game, and want something to eat."
House specialties aside, most of the Island's family-style Italian spots have similar menus, with appetizers (baked clams, fried calamari, antipasto platters, stuffed artichokes) hovering around $20; pastas (marinara, clam sauce, frutti di mare, alla vodka) and mains (Parms, Marsalas and Franceses of chicken and veal, chicken scarpariello, shrimp scampi) $25 to $35, though steaks and chops usually run a bit higher. And even if the whole family is digging in, there's often leftovers that will take you through the next few nights.
If you've never indulged in family-style dining, here's a list of our favorites to get your party started.
Piccola Bussola
970 W. Jericho Tpke. Huntington, 631-692-6300; 159 Jericho Tpke., Mineola, 516-294-4620, piccolabussolarestaurant.com
Long Island's two Piccola Bussolas are the children of La Bussola, the elegant, old-school Italian restaurant opened in 1980 by Pasquale Lubrano and Steve Vaccaro. In 1991, the first Piccola Bussola opened in Westbury, though there was nothing "little" about the space or, especially, the servings. Lubrano died in 2006; his sons Tony, John, Carlo and Marco own and operate Glen Cove, Huntington (1993) and Mineola (2003). (Vaccaro now owns the Westbury location as well as Steve's Piccola Bussola in Syosset.)
On the menu Stuffed artichokes, a dish that Pasquale learned in the '60s when he cooked at the notorious mob hangout La Stella in Forest Hills, is a perennial favorite - as are the stuffed eggplant and mushrooms on the antipasto platter that's big enough to feed a christening party. Chicken scarpariello, hearty and served on the bone, is a winner, too.
Riella's Homestyle
3103 N. Jerusalem Rd., Wantagh; 516-719-5333, riellashomestyle.com
After nearly two decades cycling through pizzerias, Vito Rastelli and Jimmy Giaccone added family-style dining to their latest pie shop in 2013 hoping to re-create a childhood fondness for meals at Don Peppe. Located in a strip mall that also houses a takeout Chinese restaurant, a hair salon and a foot spa, the intimate dining room and takeout pizzeria are divided by a half wall. Here, servers are friendly, food arrives hot and quick, and it's OK to strike up a hearty conversation with diners at a neighboring table. Giaccone mans the kitchen, where, he boasts, "the ingredients that I use in the restaurant is what you'll find in my house and in my mother's house."
On the menu Moments after being seated, warm buttery rolls and simple tomato-topped bruschetta arrive at the table, giving you more time to study the vast menu of classic fare mixed with the chef's creations. One you'll need is the white calamari arrabbiata: crispy squid tossed in a thick cherry-pepper-studded white wine, garlic and lemon sauce. Skip the chewy and greasy Johnny Boy's veal chop and instead go for the eggplant Parmesan, which is better than most, due in large part to Giaccone's deft hand at making a standout marinara sauce.
Patrizia's
1040 S. Broadway, Hicksville; 516-932-1600, patriziasofbrooklyn.com
With branches in New Jersey, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx, Patrizia's opened last year in the cavernous space in Hicksville's Planet Fitness shopping center that was most recently DeBello's Restaurant & Bar and, before that, Pizza Fabbrica. Be prepared for raucous renditions of the birthday song and, as the night progresses, singalongs (and, occasionally, dance-alongs) to - among other songs - "Sweet Caroline," "That's Amore" and "Greased Lightning."
On the menu Patrizia's offers a standard Italian-American menu as well as pizzas and Neapolitan sandwiches (panuozzi) from the wood-burning oven. The family-style menu, which the whole table (minimum two people) must order, is another thing entirely. Fifty dollars buys every person an onslaught that includes seven appetizers (Margherita pizza, eggplant Parmesan, artichokes gratinata, burrata, fried calamari, grilled octopus, baked clams) followed by a platter of the house-special pasta, fioretti alla boscaiola (purses filled with ricotta in a mushroom-prosciutto cream sauce), a platter of lamb chops and skirt steak, and, finally, a platter of Italian desserts. Plus unlimited soda, sangria, house wine (Liberty Creek, not winning any awards) or domestic beer.
388
388 Willis Ave., Roslyn Heights; 516-621-3888, 388restaurant.com
In 2012, the 2-year-old American restaurant 388 was taken over by Salvatore and Alexia Sorrentino (whose family used to own Matteo's up the road) and Chris Tsarsi. The place feels like a clubhouse where patrons, managers and servers all know one another's names. At one table, a well-manicured girls night out; at another, expensively shirted men wearing chunky wristwatches who wish they could smoke a cigar in the dining room. (Chris & Tony's in Syosset, owned by the same team plus Tony Ambrosio and Chris Fichera, has a nearly identical menu.)
On the menu Baked clams, meatballs, linguine with white clam sauce are among the well-rendered classics. Country chicken is a souped-up scarpariello with broccoli, peppers, sausage and potatoes (388's scarpariello just features the bird). Also recommended: shrimp Luciano (sauteed with wine, lemon, a touch of tomatoes and plenty of garlic) and shrimp "krak" (Luciano jacked up with cherry peppers).
La Spezia Ristorante Italiano
400 Glen Cove Ave., Sea Cliff; 516-801-4155, laspeziafamilystyle.com
One of Long Island's newest family-style Italians, La Spezia opened last year in Sea Cliff, taking over the spot that was, briefly, Taormina and, before that, Allison's and Amalfi. Owner Dario Gaite said that "La Spezia" refers to the town on the Ligurian coast in northwestern Italy from which his grandfather emigrated. But the cuisine here is pretty straight-ahead Southern Italian meets Nassau's North Shore.
On the menu The local Italian-restaurant tradition of "burnt" vegetables here is applied not only to broccoli but to cauliflower, string beans and Brussels sprouts. Some of the other less-familiar items include shrimp alla Spezia (battered served over burnt string beans) and paccheri del giorno (giant, Neapolitan rigatoni in a mushroom-prosciutto cream sauce).
Matteo's
88 Mineola Ave., Roslyn Heights; 516-484-0555, matteosristorante.com
For its first two decades, Matteo's, est. 1992, hewed closely to the family-style tradition, in surroundings that were less compelling than the fare. But in 2014, Jerry Sbarro , who bought the place from original owners Sal, Andrew and Susan Sorrentino in 2008, decided it was time to freshen the concept. Accordingly, the dining room is now a cool, contemporary blend of marble, wood and stone. Matteo's Huntington location is nearing the end of a two-year renovation; Sbarro hopes to reopen by May. (Matteo's of Bellmore is no relation, having licensed the name from the Sorrentinos before they sold to Sbarro.)
On the menu Since the makeover, Matteo's specials menu will feature such New Americans as tuna tartare or grilled whole branzino, but the classics still rule: Nonna's ragu is a Sunday gravy featuring hunks of short rib, meatballs, sausage and a big slab of ricotta to offset its deep-red savor; chicken ultimate - lightly fried cutlets in a lemony sauce, topped with melted mozzarella and cherry peppers - is perfect for the diner who can't decide between Francese and Parmesan.
La Parma
707 Willis Ave., Williston Park, 516-294-6610; 452 W. Jericho Tpke., Huntington, 631-367-6360; 410 Merrick Rd., Oceanside, 516-763-1815; 415 Main St., Port Washington, 516-439-4960; laparma.com
Long Island's first family-style Italian restaurant was modeled after Don Peppe in Ozone Park, where founders Tony Gralto and Dominick Gregorio were, respectively, waiter and cook. "It was like you're eating in your kitchen with your family on Sunday," Gralto recalled. "That's what people loved." Their original Williston Park restaurant (1984) was followed by Huntington (1987), Oceanside (1990) and Port Washington (2010).
On the menu Gralto has sold so much chicken over the years, "they tell me I am growing feathers." He is partial to the bird whether scarpariello (served on or off the bone), campagnola (scarpariello with peppers, onions, sausage and potatoes) or Chinese (counterintuitively, baked with tomato sauce, garlic and prosciutto). A new addition to the menu is cedar-planked salmon with wasabi-ginger sauce, and the kitchen stocks planks big enough to feed salmon to the whole family.
Ciao Baby
204 E. Jericho Tpke., Commack, 631-543-1400; 50-74 Sunrise Hwy., Massapequa Park, 516-799-5200; ciaobabyrestaurant.com
Ciao Baby opened in Commack in 2000 with a Rat Pack theme: Sammy Davis Jr. flickered on a video screen while Dean Martin crooned over the sound system. Three years later, the Massapequa Park location followed suit. Now, said Leonard Oliva, who owns both restaurants with Frank Cammarata, the music is more likely to be Top 40 and he's luring a younger crowd with modern brick-oven pizzas and a lively bar scene. Massapequa got a complete makeover in 2014; Commack will get a face-lift this year.
On the menu The Ciao Baby party starts with the volleyball-sized Sicilian rice ball, filled with meat sauce, peas, melted mozzarella and ricotta. Gemelli con salsiccia is twirled "twin" macaroni tossed with sausage, mushrooms, broccoli rabe in a sundried-tomato cream sauce; the "Old World" meat platter features meatballs, hot and sweet sausage, lamb and pork shoulder, all in a tomato sauce served over rigatoni.
Butera's
100 S. Main St., Sayville; 631-563-0805, buteras.com
When Butera's opened its Sayville casual Italian restaurant in 2010, the team decided it would serve family style. Martin Butera, who owns the mini-chain with his wife Laurie, brother Gary and Nick Zografos, said, "The space was perfect for the concept - with large, round tables." Butera acknowledges that the team "didn't reinvent the wheel," but believes that sharing at the table "is always in style, whether it's family-style Italian or tapas or fondue." (Butera's Smithtown location at 65 E. Main St. will do family style upon request; the Woodbury location does not.)
On the menu Caesar and asparagus-mushroom salads are both fine and big enough to satisfy two salad pasta-averse guests. Chicken Parm is appealingly gooey with a good ratio of chicken to sauce to cheese. Rigatoni Butera is the ultimate crowd-pleaser, with crumbled veal sausage and peas in a tomato-cream sauce. Among the terrific homemade desserts, try the moist pound cake with almonds and Amaretto sauce.
La Famiglia
641 Old Country Rd., Plainview, 516-938-2050; 90 W. Main St.; Babylon Village, 631-661-0101 ; lafamigliany.com
The Cracchiolos have been in the Italian restaurant business for decades, but it wasn't until 1999 that they decided to create a family-style affair. As Salvatore Cracchiolo tells it, each time he and his brothers gathered for dinner, "the family was getting bigger and bigger." The dinner table became the test kitchen. The other Italian restaurants closed and family-style became their sole focus. The chainlet boasts three locations (the one in Smithtown is closed until summer for a renovation), each featuring similar menus of classic Italian fare dotted with family recipes from the Cracchiolos' Sicilian and Napolese roots. Think spiedini, osso buco and ribs in ragu.
On the menu Cracchiolo patriarch Rosario oversees the kitchen with chef partner Joe Cruz where plump baked clams arrive hot with a balance of crisp herb-filled bread crumbs. A heaping platter of unconventional linguine carbonara comes tossed in a cream sauce, bacon and caramelized onions. Calamari fra diavolo is a break from the usual, sauteed and tossed with a fiery marinara sauce. As for dessert, tiramisu is sweet and pleasing.

Full text: Convicted Long Island mortgage fraudster David Gotterup got more than three years trimmed off his sentence for a $3.5 million mortgage modification scam on Wednesday despite a claim by Brooklyn federal prosecutors that he plagiarized parts of his personal plea for leniency.
Gotterup, 37, of Oceanside, was sentenced to 15 years in March for bilking more than 1,000 homeowners, but U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis agreed to resentence him this week because he hadn't given notice that the term might exceed federal sentencing guidelines of 135 to 168 months.
In an emotional letter to the judge, Gotterup - whose attorneys at the first hearing cited his hard upbringing after his father, Bruce, was murdered in a notorious 1991 drug-related mob hit - blamed himself for being a "coward" and making excuses instead of taking responsibility.
"All of us have spent some amount of time in the miserable camp called you 'Reep what you sow'!" Gotterup wrote. "I know there is no disappointment like that which comes from self-generated wrong doing."
But prosecutor Sylvia Shweder told Garaufis that line, and several others in the letter, were identical to passages in the foreword to a book of advice for prison inmates called "Serving Productive Time," and gave the judge highlighted copies from the book.
Based on the copied lines, she said, "It's hard for us to believe that it's sincere."
The judge was more forgiving. When it came time for Gotterup to speak, Garaufis said the copying didn't bother him. "It's still your thoughts," he said. "I don't take exception for that."
Gotterup repeated his regret about making excuses. "I realize my life has to change," he said.
The judge listened, told Gotterup that he didn't want to send a message that white-collar crime was condoned, and then reduced the sentence to 135 months - the lower end of the federal sentencing guidelines range. Garaufis didn't explain his change of heart.
Later Wednesday, he sentenced a co-defendant in the same scheme who played a lesser role, Jason Green, 36, of Oceanside, to a six-month home-detention curfew but no jail time. He was also ordered to make restitution.

Full text: McCartney insulted George W. Bush
So Newsday's editorial board wants President Donald Trump to apologize to Hillary Clinton, because his invited guests to the White House posed, and sort of mocked her in front of her portrait .
Fair enough. When Paul McCartney received the George Gershwin award in 2010 from then-President Barack Obama, McCartney said, "It's great to have a president who knows what a library is," referring to George W. Bush's intellect in a pejorative way.
Did Newsday call for an apology from Obama? If so, I do not recall. This is why the mainstream media are despised, mistrusted and becoming irrelevant. The media hate Trump, but loved Obama. This is just one example.

Mayor, LI scientist announce $500M life sciences initiative: Program to bring 16,000 biotech jobs to five boroughs Labs develop vaccines and pharmaceuticals

Abstract: According to the city's head of economic development, Maria Torres-Springer, the 16,000 spots include 9,000 "direct new jobs in commercial life sciences" and about 7,000 indirect jobs.

Full text:   A mayoral initiative co-chaired by an Oceanside-reared Nobel laureate aims to bring about 16,000 biotechnology jobs to New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.
Aiming to lure labs and research firms from biotech-heavy regions like Boston and the Bay Area, de Blasio said the city would offer $300 million in tax breaks, construct a $100 million research hub campus on Manhattan's East Side or in Queens' Long Island City, part of a $500 million push to jump-start investment in the five boroughs.
The Oceanside scientist, Dr. Harold Varmus, is former director of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, co-winner of the Nobel Prize and a Weill Cornell Medical College faculty member. He said he had been struck by the "lack of prominence" of the health-science industry in the city.
"I'm a native of Long Island, but I grew up scientifically in the Bay Area, in San Francisco, where recombinant DNA technology in the biotech industry were," said Varmus, a onetime head of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
New York City now has about 300,000 tech jobs.
According to the city's head of economic development, Maria Torres-Springer, the 16,000 spots include 9,000 "direct new jobs in commercial life sciences" and about 7,000 indirect jobs.
She called it "a full ecosystem of life sciences as we make these investments and as the industry grows."
The salary of the direct jobs will average $75,000 a year.
De Blasio said that the beneficiaries of the tax breaks would be subject to clawbacks if the job goals were not met.
"If we don't get what's been agreed to we maintain the opportunity to claw back the resources we put into it," said de Blasio, a Democrat.
The tax breaks - part of the program dubbed LifeSci NYC - will help subsidize lab and research space that is scarce and costly in real estate-starved New York City, de Blasio said.
The biotech industry develops vaccines and pharmaceuticals, builds prosthetics, and makes software to diagnose ailments.
In spring, the city will begin to make applications available for the first of about 1,000 internships over the 10-year period. The initial internships will cover the summer and fall.
A day before de Blasio's announcement, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo unveiled a separate, $650 million plan to jolt the life sciences across the state.

Boater sought by Nassau police after hit-and-run collision

Author: Valenti, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Aug 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810510439?accountid=37869

Abstract: After the larger boat fled, police said the owner of the smaller boat was able to return to its home port and the victim was taken to a hospital by the Island Park Fire Department.

Full text:   Investigators are searching for the operator of a blue-and-white high-performance powerboat who fled after colliding with a smaller 18-foot motorboat Sunday evening in Reynolds Channel, seriously injuring a woman on board.
Nassau County police said Wednesday the hit-and-run collision occurred in the channel, which separates Long Beach from mainland Nassau, and said witnesses reported the powerboat that fled appeared headed toward Oceanside. The incident occurred at 7:15 p.m.
Police said the boat that was struck was being operated by a man, who was accompanied by wife, their 14-year-old daughter and the daughter's friend. The smaller boat was obeying the posted 5 mph channel speed limit, police said.
"The operator of the boat actually heard the noise of the engine revving behind him and looked back slightly and saw what appeared to be a 25-foot Cigarette boat starting to encroach on his boat," said Det. Lt. Richard LeBrun, a department spokesman.
The owner of the smaller boat told detectives the cobalt blue high-performance boat hit the rear of his boat, then ran over the top of his boat - all the way to the center console. During that collision, police said, the larger boat hit a woman, 50, identified as the wife of owner of the smaller boat, causing what police called "multiple, serious trauma injuries."
"She went down face down into the boat and that point the boat backed off and . . . ended up traveling westbound in Reynolds Channel over to Oceanside," said LeBrun. After the larger boat fled, police said the owner of the smaller boat was able to return to its home port and the victim was taken to a hospital by the Island Park Fire Department. LeBrun said the woman suffered broken ribs and other serious injuries.
Police are asking anyone with information about the boating hit-and-run to call Fourth Squad detectives or Crime Stoppers at 800-244-TIPS. All calls will remain confidential.
The owner of the hit-and-run vessel is believed to be in his 50 or 60s, bald or with thinning hair, and with a goatee. LeBrun said the white color at the bottom of the larger boat indicates the boat may be stored in a high-drive.
"If this person is listening to the news, I urge this person that caused this accident to surrender to the Nassau County Police Department as soon as possible," said LeBrun. "Nassau County police will not tolerate any type of leaving the scene of an accident. This person should have stayed and assisted this family during this time of crisis."

Abstract: St. Anthony's has had balanced scoring, with five players with at least two points with Sara McGiff leading with three points (one goal, two assists).

Full text:   1. Massapequa (4-0)
The Chiefs have outscored their opponents, 18-5, this season and are coming off a 6-1 win over Oceanside. Hope Breslin leads all Nassau AA players with seven goals and 10 points.
2. St. Anthony's (3-0)
The Friars had a pair of shutout victories last week and have outscored opponents 7-1 this season. St. Anthony's has had balanced scoring, with five players with at least two points with Sara McGiff leading with three points (one goal, two assists).
3. Islip (4-0)
Islip picked up a pair of 6-1 victories in Suffolk League VI last week and again look like the team to beat in Suffolk Class A. Hannah Franco and Lyndsey Sparks each had two-goal, one-assist games.
4. Northport (6-0)
The Northport defense, led by last season's Suffolk II MVP Stephanie Rapp, has continued its dominance from last season -- allowing just three goals this season to a 6-0 start.
5. East Meadow (4-0-1)
East Meadow tied Garden City and defeated Syosset, 2-1, on Melanie Navas' late second-half goal. The Jets will have their toughest test of the season Wednesday against Massapequa.

The Cougars handed Ward Melville its first loss of the season, courtesy of Alexandra Johnson's winning goal with one minute remaining in the second overtime on Friday.

9. South Side (2-2-1)
Don't let South Side's record fool you. Its two losses came to Massapequa and St. Anthony's in non-conference games and has defeated Sacred Heart and Oceanside. Led by Ally Diez and goalkeeper Kayla Klarides, South Side is a dangerous Nassau Class A team.
10. Sacred Heart (3-1)
After its season-opening loss to South Side, Sacred Heart has won three straight, including wins over Garden City and Kellenberg.

Full text:   Hannah Franco scored the winning goal on a header between two defenders off a 24-yard free kick from Alyssa Sparks in the 65th minute to give Islip (11-0) a 2-1 win over Shoreham-Wading River in Suffolk VI girls soccer yesterday.
Franco scored the game's opening goal in the 53rd minute from 15 yards out off Alleyah Esnuria's assist following a steal.
"It's not a knock on her but it's expected of her," said coach Mike Reilly. "It didn't shock me. It was Hannah Franco soccer and Hannah Franco soccer is outstanding soccer and your top players have to come through when you're not playing well and she came through today."
Shoreham-Wading River (6-2-2) tied the score at 1 less than five minutes later after Franco's first goal when Sophia Triandafils followed her shot - which was saved by Emma Rafferty before bouncing off the post - for a rebound goal. The Wildcats had a chance to tie the score at 2 before Islip defenderDominique Bono cleared the ball off the goal line with 12 seconds remaining in the match.
Bayport-Blue Point 2, Miller Place 0: Maggie Clark had a goal and an assist to lead Bayport-Blue Point (5-4) in Suffolk VI.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
With its exuberant, kaleidoscopic flavors, the Cajun-Creole kitchen always seems to promise good times. Mardi Gras, as New Orleans' most famous chef would say, kicks it up a notch. French for "Fat Tuesday," the day before Ash Wednesday (this year Feb. 9) was traditionally an occasion for Catholics to get their last helpings of rich food before the privations of Lent. Here are eight places on Long Island that specialize in the food of New Orleans where you can laissez les bons temps rouler ("Let the good times roll").
The Bayou
2823 Jerusalem Ave., Bellmore, 516-785-9263, bayou4bigfun.com
Along with Mardi Gras, this year The Bayou is celebrating its 30th anniversary. The party starts on Feb. 4 with an all-you-can-eat crawfish boil. There are special events every night through Feb. 9 when there will be a $55 three-course "Amazin' Cajun" dinner menu whose highlights include gumbo (chicken and sausage or seafood), "Decatur gator" (deep-fried alligator tail meat with jalapeo sauce), crawfish-andouille-crusted catfish with Marsala-mushroom cream sauce and "voodoo-death" crawfish (death, in this case, by habanero). Music by the rockabilly band The Buzzards.
Big Daddy's
1 Park Lane, Massapequa, 516-799-8877, bigdaddysny.com
In the run-up to Mardi Gras, Big Daddy's will be offering a live crawfish boil and two-for-one oyster shooters from Feb. 4 to 6. Sunday brunch features Blue Point oysters for $1 each and Monday night is a black-and-white Zulu ball with free hurricanes, a sweet drink made with fruit juice and rum (one per customer). On Tuesday, doors open at 11 a.m. for lunch accompanied by the Jack Morelli Trio. The dinner buffet, beginning at 5 p.m., requires a ticket ($35) and will include jambalaya, gumbo, muffaletta, red beans and rice. Costumes are highly recommended. The Johnny Mac Band starts playing at 8 p.m., and it's anyone's guess when it will stop.

488 Merrick Rd., Oceanside, 516-442-9838
This new sliver of a sandwich shop brings New Orleans flavor to Oceanside. Chef Joe LoSchiavo excels at gumbo, jambalaya and etouffe, but the stars of the show are the sandwiches. Classic po'boys are filled with everything from fried oysters to braised beef and, for Mardi Gras, pork chop with coleslaw. LoSchiavo's own inventions include a rich cochon panino (three cuts of pork sandwiched, red cabbage and provolone pressed into oozy submission) and pan-roasted dark-meat chicken with arugula, olives, pesto, roast-pepper mayonnaise and mozzarella. On Mardi Gras, every sandwich comes with a "lagniappe" (an extra freebie) of dessert or side. Almost everything at Louisiana Joe's is less than $10. The shop closes at 3 p.m.

Zika virus symposium aims to calm public fears on infection: Travelers, pregnant women urged to stay vigilant Large parts of Latin America, Caribbean affected

Author: Lam, Chau

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 Apr 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1781724315?accountid=37869

Abstract: The woman, Sandra Sutain, 71, said Monday that her daughter-in-law, who lives in Massachusetts, is so concerned about the emerging threat of the mosquito-borne virus that she had already canceled her Aruba vacation and plans to do the same with her upcoming New York trip.

Full text:   At a symposium held in Oceanside to address concerns over the Zika virus, a woman wanted to know whether it's safe for her pregnant daughter-in-law to visit her in Lido Beach this summer.
The woman, Sandra Sutain, 71, said Monday that her daughter-in-law, who lives in Massachusetts, is so concerned about the emerging threat of the mosquito-borne virus that she had already canceled her Aruba vacation and plans to do the same with her upcoming New York trip.
"Is she safer in the Berkshire Mountains than at Lido Beach?" Sutain asked an infectious disease expert. "We're all panicking."
One panelist, Dr. Aaron E. Glatt, chairman of the medicine department and division chief of infectious diseases at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, which hosted the symposium for the public, said he has been fielding similar questions regarding travel, usually outside the United States, several times a day.
"Certainly a pregnant woman should be concerned about where she is traveling in general, not only because of Zika," Glatt said. "But I would reassure you, at this point in time, she shouldn't have any fears about coming to Long Island."
The Zika virus, which causes microcephaly, a birth defect marked by unusually small head and brain size, is likely to make its way to the United States, White House officials said earlier this month. And cities as far north as New York and San Francisco could experience cases of the infection by this summer.
Glatt and his colleague, Dr. Nicholas Tarricone, an obstetrician and gynecologic surgeon, answered wide-ranging questions from attendees on Monday.
One woman among the several dozen people in attendance, wanted to know whether a mosquito could spread the disease by attacking an infected person, then biting other people.
"It's theoretically possible," Glatt said. "It has not happened yet in the United States."
Is one type of contraceptive better at preventing the spread of the Zika virus than another, a woman asked.
"No," Tarricone said.
In addition to mosquito bites, the Zika virus can be transmitted sexually, though so far documented cases show the transmission from clinically sick men to women or from men to other men, Glatt said. He said most people who contract the virus develop no symptoms at all. The virus, however, can cause a rash, fever and conjunctivitis - red eyes - in some people.
The concern about the Zika virus, Tarricone said, is the devastating harm it could inflict on unborn children. It's more a concern for people who plan to become pregnant.
A woman infected with the Zika virus or who had traveled to affected areas, a large swath of Latin America and the Caribbean, should avoid trying to get pregnant for eight weeks, Tarricone said. Men who have tested positive for the virus should abstain from trying to impregnate a woman for six months.

Larson sparks Long Beach to softball semifinals

Author: Gavin, Mike

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 May 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788809733?accountid=37869

Abstract: [...]baseman Jackie Muratori and third baseman Mannle prevented a few base hits in the infield.

Full text:   For Tonianne Larson, it was just like a day at the beach.
Larson had been preparing for this moment since elementary school, when she and many of her current teammates first started playing whiffle ball together on the beach.
"We all knew each other, this is obviously a small town," said Larson, the ace of the Long Beach softball team. "We all went to different elementary schools. But we all went to the same beach."
Now, instead of playing on sand, they play on dirt. Instead of being surrounded by the ocean, they're surrounded by grass. And on Saturday, the longtime teammates earned their biggest win yet as Long Beach defeated defending county champion Oceanside, 2-0, in the Nassau Class AA quarterfinals.
Larson tossed a two-hit shutout and also delivered a go-ahead RBI double in the bottom of the sixth inning.
"Toni is the hardest worker on the team," Long Beach coach Carmine Verde said. "She's a performer. She knows in the big game she has to rise to the occasion. She did that today, both on the mound and at the plate."
Colleen Mannle led off the bottom of the sixth with a bunt single. Larson then lined a double to the gap in right-center field and Mannle slid home safely to give Long Beach a 1-0 lead.
"I put myself in a good position with the 2-and-1 count, and I really wanted to win," Larson said. "I had a girl in position to score, so I just really focused and hit it."
Kirsthie Rodriguez followed with an RBI single up the middle to increase the lead to 2-0. That was all the support needed for Larson, who struck out seven and walked one by mixing her pitches and hitting her spots. Sabrina Seeger matched zeroes for most of the game, allowing four hits and three walks, and striking out four for Oceanside (4-15).
The defense behind Larson played flawlessly, a point of emphasis entering the game. Rodriguez made a series of pretty catches in center, including a running grab on a long drive by Grace Bandini in the top of the fourth. Second baseman Jackie Muratori and third baseman Mannle prevented a few base hits in the infield.
"Stay on your toes and make the plays," Mannle said of the defensive strategy. "Tonianne pitched a great game and we just had to back her up with all we had . . . Once they got one runner on they were stealing on us. So just keeping them off the bases, that was all we needed so we could get back in the dugout and hit."
Once they did that, Larson delivered, helping to send Long Beach (11-7) to the best-of-three semifinal series against top-seeded MacArthur, which begins on Monday.
So, did she have any game-winning hits similar to Saturday's back when they played whiffle ball on the beach all those years ago?
"No," she said with a laugh. "I wasn't that good when I was younger."

Asking the clergy: How does your faith view remarriage after a divorce?

Author: Merritt, Jim

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]12 June 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1795743362?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text:   In April, Pope Francis released a document, "On Love in the Family," urging mercy in the treatment of couples who remarry after a divorce, rather than an annulment. This week's clergy discuss what the Bible says about acceptable reasons for divorce and the possibilities of a second chance at matrimony.
Rabbi Levi Gurkov
Chabad of Oceanside
The Jewish view is that, yes, it is absolutely permissible, and actually strongly encouraged, to remarry. The Torah view is that Adam, the first being created by God, had a dual part to himself - a female aspect and a male aspect. And when God separated the female aspect from the male aspect, he set them apart, not as polar opposites but as complements to each other. And ever since then, every human being, whether male or female, has an incomplete soul awaiting its completion by finding its soul mate, its counterpart, or its better half. If you are compatible, you are complete as a human being, and it is bliss. If, unfortunately, you reach a point when it's detrimental to stay in that union, then the Torah prescribes the manner under which this union is to be dissolved. The divorce process, known as a "get," gives both parties the opportunity to go on their journey to find their missing piece of the puzzle - to match their soul. I do a lot of matrimonials and lot of gets, and I can tell you that in the Torah view, marriage is a very sacred union, known as "kidushin," or an act of sanctity and of holiness. The happiness between the spouses in the second marriage deserves to have the same blessings for a happy and healthy future in peace and harmony and shouts of "Mazel Tov!"
Joseph Garofalo
Outreach pastor, Island Christian Church, East Northport
God's view of marriage is that it is holy and sacred. In the Old Testament, the prophet Malachi says that God hates divorce, "for it covers one's garment with violence." That means that God views divorce as a "gross act of sin, like blood splattered from a murder victim on the killer." (Malachi 2:16) In the New Testament, when Jesus is asked by the Pharisees if it's lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason, Jesus quotes Genesis 2:24, which says, "A man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife so they are no longer two, but one flesh." This is where you hear the well-known quotation in Christian wedding ceremonies, "what God has joined together let no one separate." (Matthew 19:6) In God's view marriage is a covenant relationship, and a covenant relationship is until death. However, there are times when God considers divorce as the lesser of the two evils. Jesus affirms that divorce is acceptable in cases of sexual immorality and the apostle Paul, who also affirms that marriage should be for life, but states in 1 Corinthians 7:15 that divorce is permissible if the couple is unequally yoked. For instance, if two unbelievers marry, and subsequently, one becomes a believer, they are then unequally yoked. If the unbelieving spouse wishes to depart, the Bible says let them. "A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances." However, if the unbelieving spouse is willing to stay in the marriage, then the believer should allow that and not divorce their spouse.
The Rev. William F. Brisotti
Pastor, Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal R.C. Church, Wyandanch
In the Roman Catholic Church, as in all Christian churches, the understanding is that marriage is forever, a lifetime commitment. However, gradually, we've become more accepting of divorce because we understand that we're imperfect beings. We make mistakes, and things can change in the course of our lives. I remember that when I was a kid, I had friends whose parents divorced when the children reached the age of 18 or 19. I realize now that there must have been a problem between these married couples all along, but at that time there was a strong taboo against divorce. In the late 1960s, after Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church started expanding the annulment process, and making it more accessible. The process is not a divorce, but it increases the ways people can qualify for annulments in a relationship that was doomed from the beginning, for instance, in which there was deceit or no desire to have children. Now, Pope Francis is opening up a space of understanding and mercy toward divorced Catholics who remarry in good conscience. You don't have to be perfect before you participate fully in the church. Pope Francis says in his "Evangelii Gaudium" that the Eucharist is "not a prize for the perfect, but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak." The last thing we say before the receiving Holy Communion is, "Oh Lord I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word and my soul will be healed." The Pope is emphasizing that whole concept so that people who are involved in second marriages will not feel alienated from the church.

LONG BEACH
Man charged with
assaulting police
An Oceanside man was arrested Friday night after he assaulted two Nassau County police officers as they tried to arrest him on drug and weapon charges in Long Beach, police said.
Nassau police said the officers stopped a 2011 Nissan Altima on Austin Boulevard near California Place North about 9:47 p.m. During the stop, the officers discovered a plastic bag of marijuana belonging to Charles Rodriguez, 33, a front-seat passenger in the Nissan, police said.
The officers searched Rodriguez outside the car and found a gravity knife in his front pants pocket. Police said Rodriguez resisted arrest and tried to grab one officer's gun from its holster and the other's baton. Additional officers responded to the scene to help arrest Rodriguez.
The Nissan's driver, Adriana Cacioppo, 21, of Hewlett, and two other passengers - Francesca Delfino, 19, of Oceanside, and Victoria Daniels, 22, of Woodmere - remained inside the car.
Police said they arrested the three after a search of the car revealed three bags of heroin, a hypodermic needle, cocaine and a hallucinogen.
The two officers were treated at a hospital for minor injuries and released, police said.
Rodriguez was charged with resisting arrest, attempted robbery, criminal possession of a weapon and drug offenses.
All four were to be arraigned today at First District Court in Hempstead.

A 28-year-old woman was driving the 2003 Chevy Tahoe on Mastic Boulevard near Madison Street when a fire started in the back of the vehicle, where the girl was sitting, about 3:20 p.m., a police spokeswoman said.
The girl was pulled from the vehicle with minor burns and taken to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Patchogue.
The woman and a 12-year-old boy who had been sitting in the front seat were uninjured. None of the victims were identified by name.
Photos from the scene show a crumpled and blackened backseat in the SUV and Mastic firefighters pulling a large, charred speaker system from the vehicle's rear.
Suffolk police's arson squad and fire officials were investigating the cause of the blaze, the spokeswoman said.

Full text: Libraries are key community resources
As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo prepares the state budget for the coming year, we ask that he provide ample funding for the libraries of our great state.
Our libraries are more community focused than ever. Some people mistake them for lesser-used warehouses for books. Not at all!
Within our libraries, babies and young children become literate through programs with their caretakers while forging lifelong friendships.
Libraries are safe havens where teens can socialize with peers and take advantage of many resources to complete school assignments and continue journeys of lifetime education.
Librarians offer one-on-one help with basic and emerging technologies, and everything in between. Staff members help people of all ages in countless ways, including bringing communities together through sharing space and encouraging educational enrichment through reading.
An investment in libraries is an investment in literacy, which is the currency for success.
Jane Deitz,
Lindenhurst

A stranger jumped in with her credit card
At a CVS in Oceanside on Monday, my bill for medications and toiletries came to $192. I put my credit card in the reader, but the payment wouldn't go through. I tried two or three times.
The line grew, and my face must have been red. As I looked for my debit card, a young woman put her card in the reader and said, "I got this."
"It's $192," the clerk said.
"It doesn't matter how much it is," the woman said. "It's a Christmas gift."
I immediately took her card out, and my debit card did work.
I quickly thanked her, but had to sit down to get a grip on what had just happened.
I composed myself (not really) and then hugged the woman for her overwhelming kindness. Everyone on the line smiled at her heartfelt act.
Thank you to this young lady from the bottom of my heart. May you and your family celebrate a wonderful holiday.
Vivian Doles,
Oceanside

Wright takes control: Steps up game in second half to boost Knights

Full text: "Every game has its own story."
It's a phrase that Uniondale boys basketball coach Tom Diana uses often and as his Knights battled Oceanside in the third quarter on Tuesday, the game's story was unfolding more like a nightmare than a triumph. The Sailors' Jaden Jenkins sent a long three-pointer ripping through the net with 1:30 left in the period,cutting a Uniondale lead that had been 10 to just two.
Diana called a timeout. Then Jo Jo Wright changed the story's narrative. The freshman point guard assisted or scored on the last three Knights possessions in the quarter, restoring the margin to nine, and kept it up through the fourth as host Uniondale accelerated away for a 71-46 Nassau AA-I triumph.
Wright had four points and six assists when Diana called that timeout. He finished with 21 points and nine assists to lead the Knights (7-1, 3-0).
"I told him he wasn't going to get the whole lead back on one play, I told him to play his game and stop forcing," Diana said. "When he is seeing the court and involving the other players it is just amazing to watch."
"He woke me up and I started getting everyone involved," said Wright, who logged serious minutes as an eighth-grader last season as Uniondale repeated as county champion. "When I'm doing that, everyone is playing harder on both ends because we're having fun."
Out of the timeout, he found Jason Charles for a layup. On the next Uniondale possession, he drove left to the baseline for a fadeaway. And he closed the third with a three-pointer from the wing for a 48-39 lead. He assisted or scored on eight of the first 10 Knights points in the fourth as the lead grew to 58-41.
"He's not afraid of the moment," Diana said. "He's played big minutes in big games."
Senior guard Isaiah Joseph-Brock continued to emerge as a key player for the Knights with 15 points and Jayden Freeman added 10 points. Dimitri Garrett had 12 points for Oceanside (4-7, 2-2).
Uniondale has players who competed on the big stage a year ago, but no returning starters and thus is a work in progress. It has two things though that already give it a daunting look: a high octane pace and a rotation of eight to 11 players, making it hard for other teams to keep up.
"We wear teams down because we're much more than just five good players," Joseph-Brock said. "We can take their legs faster because we're deep."
That was apparent in the final quarter, when the Sailors managed only one field goal.
"We're Uniondale and everybody comes at us with their best," Wright said. "We needed a push, but once we got it you could see what we can do. There's more work do to and I only see us getting better."

Accused killer had hip-hop hopes

Full text: The video posted on YouTube last month is standard hip-hop fare: BabyTy smokes, flashes cash and bounces up and down with his friends on a glorious summer day on Pine Avenue in Long Beach. One kid pops a wheelie on his bicycle. 
"He wanna fight, we can fight, he wanna shoot, we can shoot," BabyTy says in the video for "When the Trap Call."
BabyTy - Tyler Flach, 18, of Lido Beach - was charged with second-degree murder Thursday in First District Court in Hempstead, three days after Nassau County prosecutors said the aspiring hip-hop artist plunged a knife into the chest of Khaseen Morris, 16, of Oceanside during a fight sparked by a dispute over a girl. 
Flach's attorney, Edward Sapone of Garden City, said the hip-hop hopeful's music career appeared to be taking off - until this week. 
"Recently, he caught the attention of a notable music producer, who met with him to take him on as a client, and then this happened," Sapone said, referring to the arrest.
Nassau police said Flach stabbed Morris on Monday in the parking lot of an Oceanside strip mall, while dozens of teens recorded the stabbing on their phones instead of assisting the victim. Flach pleaded not guilty Thursday during an arraignment in First District Court in Hempstead in front of Judge Gary M. Carlton, who ordered him held without bail. 
Sapone said Flach enrolled in Nassau Community College after graduating from Long Beach High School in 2018.
"He is pursuing a career in music, so he immediately matriculated as a student of Nassau County Community College, majoring in business and music sound engineering," the attorney said. 
Authorities said Flach had a criminal record that included arrests for assault last May and possession of a controlled substance earlier this month. 
But Sapone said Flach's criminal record doesn't tell the whole story about his client. He said Flach has "an excellent voice with a large following of fans" on both social media and in the community. 
The teen comes from a "solid, hard-working family," the attorney said. His parents are divorced, and Flach lives with his mother in Lido Beach. Flach's father splits his time between Israel and New York.
Sapone said Flach's mother came to the courthouse to support her son, but didn't come inside for the arraignment due to security concerns raised by court of

EXPRESSWAY: JOYFUL DAYS OF THE FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS

Full text: Diwali will be celebrated for five days beginning later this week with gatherings, feasts, dancing, new clothes, gifts of sweet dishes and the lighting of candles and bonfires. The annual festival of lights is celebrated by Hindus and others on Long Island and all over the world.
After I came to this country in the 1970s, celebrations of the Fourth of July, especially the firecrackers, never failed to remind me of Diwali back when I was growing up in India. As a child there, I could hardly sleep the night before Diwali because of the excitement that awaited the following morning, much as Christian children feel at Christmas.
The 2010 U.S. census counted 56,000 people of Indian descent on Long Island, and no doubt most will observe the holiday, which celebrates the victory of good over evil. In India, the nearly 1 billion Hindus are a multitude of linguistic and caste-based communities, and each group celebrates in slightly different ways.
In my Tamil-Brahmin community (coloquially known as the Tam-Brahm) in New Delhi, which has its roots in southern India, an oil bath (head-to-toe oil smearing followed by a bath) is customary before sunrise on the festival's main day, which this year falls on Sunday to coincide with the new moon. Then, we wear new clothes and enjoy mouth-watering savories.
An early morning fireworks display is a major marker of the festival everywhere. Neighbors vie to make their shows first, loudest and longest. Days before Diwali, shops in India stock a multitude of fireworks, which shoppers buy as quickly as possible so they will not be deprived of a considerable stash.
On Diwali morning when I was 11, my father had spread out our firecrackers on a steel plate over the stove so they would be crisp and have maximum effect when exploded. Then, while he got busy with other chores, the firecrackers overheated and went off on their own. The racket created panic among family members. Everyone scampered for safety. Dad quickly put out the fire with a wool blanket.
This near-disaster gave me a life-long fear of firecrackers. In some ways, I am happy that Long Island laws prohibit fireworks for personal use. Then again, I see more and more people breaking this rule on July Fourth, Labor Day and other civil holidays.
No matter how well assimilated an immigrant might be, sometimes even for the next generation, the tug of the home country is strong, and reminders of the past are cherished.
After my husband and I had started a family in Oceanside, we sent our two boys, still toddlers, with my mother one year to visit India to experience the authentic, real-deal Diwali. To this day, I cherish photos that show their glee as they, my father and my younger sister entertain each other with sparklers.

SINGAS, MCQUADE VYING TO BE NASSAU D.A.: BOTH CITE THEIR EXPERIENCES AS RIGHT FOR THE JOB

Author: Ferrette, Candice

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]31 Oct 2019: 12.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Madeline Singas was a career prosecutor who had never run for public office before she was elected Nassau County's district attorney in 2015.
Now, as she campaigns for a second term, Singas, a Democrat, is touting her record as the county's top prosecutor as the reason voters should return her to the office.
She says she has helped bring about a 25% drop in the county's crime rate, gone after the MS-13 gang and attacked the opioid crisis by addressing drug trafficking and through drug treatment programs.  
"Crime is at historic lows," said Singas, 53, of Manhasset. "That doesn't happen by accident. That happens because we are experienced people at the helm who can collaborate with other law enforcement agencies who understand how to identify crime drivers - that's why those numbers happen."
Republican challenger Francis X. McQuade has worked as a criminal defense and civil rights attorney for the past 25 years.
He says his past experience as a police officer for the Village of Ocean Beach on Fire Island and as a Roman Catholic priest also helped shape his understanding of the law - "knowing where crime begins and where it ends," as he put it.
McQuade, 65, of Long Beach, said he respects Singas' experience but cautions against giving her and the Democrats more power as sweeping criminal justice reforms initiated by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic majority in the State Legislature are implemented.
"I'm a new DA for a new day," McQuade said. "I believe in treating everyone fairly. I'm a little more balanced, maybe a little more human. Experience counts but experiences count more."
With the Nov. 5 election approaching, both candidates over the last few weeks have been reaching out to voters in debates, candidate forums, diners and train stations, making the case for why they're the most qualified choice to lead the district attorney's office and control the agency's $45 million budget. 
Singas is the youngest of two daughters of Greek immigrants, and was born and raised in Astoria, Queens. Her father, Bill Singas, worked at a bakery before saving enough money to open Singas Famous Pizza in 1967 in Elmurst, Queens. Known for their smaller pizza pie size the restaurant chain now has 13 locations. 
Singas graduated from Barnard College in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in political science, and received a degree in 1991 from Fordham University School of Law. After law school, Singas worked as an assistant district attorney in Queens.  
In 2006, former Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice hired Singas to lead the county's special victims bureau. Rice was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014, and Singas was tapped as acting Nassau district attorney. 
In 2015, Singas won a four-year term, beating former Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray, a Republican.
Singas is married with twin daughters. 
McQuade was born in Brooklyn and raised in East Rockaway, the second of six children of Francis Joseph McQuade, an electrical engineer, and Carthene Marinaro McQuade, a schoolteacher. 
He graduated from St. John's University law school in 1994 and received a bachelor of arts degree in history from Cathedral College in Queens in 1976. He also earned a master's of divinity from Immaculate Conception Seminary in Lloyd Harbor in 1981. 
After law school, McQuade became field director of St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corp., where his duties included negotiating collective bargaining agreements.
In 1997, McQuade opened a law office in Long Beach representing clients - many of them in the country illegally - facing criminal charges including DWI, petty larceny and domestic abuse. McQuade served as counsel from 2005 to 2015 to the Long Beach Housing Authority. He has extensively traveled through Latin America and is fluent in Spanish.
He is married with three adult sons.
In the campaign, Singas and McQuade have focused primarily on issues such as gang violence, opioid addiction and sex and drug trafficking.
A package of criminal justice reforms passed by state legislators in April also has emerged as a key issue.
The laws set tighter deadlines for court filings to protect defendants' rights to a speedy trial, mandated that defense attorneys receive evidence or "discovery" materials within days of an arrest and ended cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.
Another provision reduces the maximum sentence for the most serious "Class A" misdemeanors by one day, to 364 days. The intent is to protect from deportation people who are in the country illegally; a sentence of one year previously could trigger deportation proceedings.
Many of these changes have prompted county GOP lawmakers, who hold an 11-8 majority on the Nassau Legislature, to try to mitigate the local impact of the new laws before they take effect Jan. 1.
Nassau's Republicans have proposed a new Office of Crime Victims Advocate within the police department to provide legal assistance to victims and witnesses to crimes
"For the sake of all Nassau County residents, it's important that whoever our District Attorney is in January work hand in hand with the legislature to create protections for victims and witnesses who will be affected by the state's new criminal justice 'reforms,'" legislative Presiding Officer Richard Nicolello (R-New Hyde Park) said in a statement.  
Singas said her office is working on how to implement the state legislation. DA officials have met with all the town and village police departments in Nassau and are working to update computer systems to prepare for the changes.
In debates, Singas has said that as a prosecutor she doesn't necessarily agree with all the state provisions.
"We all felt that it was time for some criminal justice reform," Singas said. "What we didn't like was the haste with which these laws came about. So now we're in a position of not being able to actually change anything until they go back and revote or redraft. So we are giving them suggestions."
McQuade says cashless bail issue "is complex" and criticizes Singas for supporting asset forfeiture - the practice of seizing cars, homes and money from criminal defendants before conviction. McQuade said seizure violates the civil liberties of people who have not been convicted.
Singas noted that as acting DA in 2015 she committed $585,000 from criminal asset forfeiture funds to start a drug treatment program.
Nassau GOP chairman Joseph Cairo said he believes McQuade has a "common-sense approach" to the criminal justice system.
"He knows that the new extreme Democrats' "criminals first" agenda that was passed in Albany this year will put more dangerous criminals back on the streets," Cairo said in a statement.
Nassau's Police Benevolent Association has not endorsed either district attorney candidate, said James McDermott, the union's president. He declined further comment.
The union endorsed former Republican Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray when she opposed then-acting District Attorney Singas for the job in 2015.
Nassau Democratic chairman Jay Jacobs said the two candidates "are in a completely different league."
"People may find reasons to vote for McQuade - I don't know what they would be but they are certainly not based on experience," Jacobs said. "While he was going to South America allegedly bribing judges, she was busy prosecuting people who do that."
Jacobs was referring to an interview with Newsday's editorial board in which McQuade described how he helped clients in trouble in Central America.
"I go down there and bribe a few judges," he said.  
Asked during a News 12 Long Island debate and again by a Newsday reporter to clarify his statement, McQuade apologized for using the word "bribe."
"It was flip and inaccurate to use the word 'bribe,'" McQuade said. "I was being a little informal but it was a poor choice of words." 
McQuade said he has at times given money to judges or another intermediary for inmate expenses such as food and lodging, a practice he described as common in developing nations.
"I have negotiated in some very hard spots all over the world," McQuade said. "It's not easy and certainly defies convention. But to say that I bribe judges is an exaggeration. If I did that I would be in the cell as well." 
At a recent GOP event held at the North Merrick firehouse on Camp Avenue, McQuade's life experiences and his willingness to uphold the more conservative and libertarian ideas such as aggressively prosecuting violent street crime and his rejection of asset forfeiture. 
"He is a gentleman who really represents the conservative Republican ideals of our party," said North Bellmore Republican Club leader Jay Reinhardt in introducing McQuade. "He's bilingual, he's an immigration attorney - he crosses over into a lot of different topics that affect Long Islanders every day."
On a different evening, Singas shook hands at a Rockville Centre diner where she spoke about the work of her office.
Among them was Judy Arabian, 55, a retired middle school teacher from Oceanside who promised her vote to Singas.
Arabian said she was impressed with the investigation into a recent teen brawl that resulted in the stabbing death of a 16-year-old in Oceanside.  
"They did a thorough investigation and I feel better knowing she was taking the reins on that one," Arabian said.

Stanford, Rinn: Dynamic duo shines

Full text: Oceanside teammates Catherine Stanford and Morgan Rinn share a special bond.
One that goes beyond the swimming pool.
"Our motivation and our mindset are the same. We really believe in each other," Stanford said. "We are so driven and get along so well at school and at practice, and even hang out outside of school."
The Sailors' dynamic duo were both double winners Saturday at the Nassau girls swimming championships at the Nassau Aquatic Center.
Stanford won the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard freestyle for the fourth consecutive season and was named the most valuable swimmer of the meet for the second straight year. She finished with a time of 22.93 in the 50 free and 50.11 in the 100 free.
The senior broke her own school record of 23.31 that she set at county's last year, when she swam a 22.92 during Friday night's preliminary heats. That time is the fastest in the state this season.
"It is such an honor. I know the girls train as hard as me and work as hard as me," Stanford said. "Deep down it's really about being mentally tough. The support I have behind me from my family means the world to me."
Rinn won the 200 IM (2:04.43) and the 100 fly (56.43) for the second straight year. The two will remain teammates next fall when they swim at Penn State.
"We have been friends for so long and to be able to train with her and win these events is an indescribable feeling," Rinn said. "To be able to have her by my side for the next four years is so exciting."
Manhasset junior Francesca Raimondi finished first in the 200 free (1:50.90) and was the runner-up in the 500 free (5:03.88). Fellow junior Sophia Karras of Herricks was second in the 200 free (1:50.99) and won the 500 free in 4:52.79, the second fastest time in the state. Lauren Kuzma (Garden City) won the 100 breaststroke in 1:04.75 and was second in the 200 IM (2:07.02). South Side's Kiara Kennedy placed first in the 100 backstroke (56.20).
Garden City captured the Nassau team title for the 21st consecutive season, scoring 476 points. The Trojans won the first event, the 200 medley relay, in a school-record time of 1:48.03. The previous record of 1:48.8 was set in 2017 at the county championship. Bellmore-Merrick finished second with a total of 407.5 points and Manhasset was third (372).
"This probably means more to me this year than any of the other years," an emotional Garden City coach Anne Sullivan said. "My brother passed away on Halloween, and not only did he follow me in my swimming career, he was a big supporter of Garden City swimming. This meet was for him."

Coat owners out in the cold after furrier's death

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some Long Islanders who sought to take their furs out of storage as winter nears have faced a labyrinthine trail to locate their coats and stoles after the death of a furrier known as Morty.
One customer of Morton Fur Design Corp. said she went to the store in Oceanside on Nov. 9 expecting to greet Morty and recover her furs, only to find the business shuttered.
The customer, who asked not to be named for fear of being targeted by animal-rights activists, said she soon learned that Morton "Morty" Lichtenstein, "a sweetheart of a man," had died months earlier. He was 82.
After visiting a neighboring business, Bella Hair Salon, she got a phone number for the store's rental agent. The rental agent suggested that she contact the Nassau County Sheriff's Department, which gave her the phone number for Hempstead-based Bennett Movers, which had taken possession of the furs after the fur business was evicted.
"I totally lucked out -- I got them all back," she said after retrieving her furs from Bennett. "Of course if I hadn't chased down all of my leads...it never would have happened. I feel really bad for the people who either don't know the situation or don't know how to proceed."
David Gravagna of Bennett Movers said his company took possession of about 200 furs when the business was evicted in June. Initially a sign was posted on the door of Morton Fur Design directing people to Bennett, he said, but eventually the sign was removed.
"We have about 50 coats left," he said. "As a courtesy, we've been keeping them. We don't have any paperwork. It's kind of a mess. The landlord was only responsible for 30 days of storage."
Compounding the problem is that many of the fur owners are elderly.
"It's an older clientele," Gravagna said. "They're harder to reach. We've been spreading word of mouth."

Lindy on defensive: Ruckert leads stingy Dawgs in Trojans rematch

Author: Sarra, Gregg

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It begins and ends with the defense at Lindenhurst.
And it all starts with the Dawgs emotional leader Will Ruckert.
The senior captain has the unit lit before every series. And watch the fire in that unit burn when Ruckert gets a tackle for a loss. He goes into the "Ruck Strut."
"He's the absolute best," said Lindenhurst coach Nick Lombardo. "I love the kid and his passion for the game and his team. He's my kind of player. He's physical, spirited, team-oriented and the consummate leader."
And the Ruck Strut?
"It's kind of ugly, but I love it," Lombardo said. "It intensifies the defense. It's his way of showing emotion and this game swings on emotion. We're going to need a motivated defensive effort to beat Garden City. And it all starts up front with guys like Will."
Lindenhurst (11-0) will meet Garden City (10-1) for the Long Island Class II football championship at Hofstra University Saturday at 4:30 p.m. The game is a rematch of last year's title game won by Garden City, 19-0.
The losing result has stuck with Ruckert throughout the off-season.
"I haven't been able to let it go," Ruckert said. "We allowed 19 points and they shut us out. Nineteen to zero, no way. All I thought about was getting back to this game and having another shot at them. They're a great program and so are we."
Ruckert led a defense that has turned in four shutouts. The Dawgs are the least scored upon defense on Long Island, allowing 6.5 points per game.
"We take it personal when someone scores," Ruckert said. "We put in the work in the off-season to get stronger and win the battles up front on the lines."
Garden City (10-1) is looking to become the first team in Long Island history to win four straight LIC crowns. The three-time defending champions have only allowed 12 total points in the past three championships.
The Trojans share the record book with Lawrence, Floyd, Shoreham-Wading River and North Babylon as the only programs to win three straight LIC titles.
Garden City is making an LIC record 18th appearance, winning eight times. This is Lindenhurst's fourth appearance since 2014 with its only win coming against Oceanside in 2017.
"It's always a tough mountain to climb when you play Garden City," Lombardo said. "We didn't score a point last year and that really bothers our guys. You don't need any added motivation when you play a program like Garden City. They have that championship pedigree."
Garden City is riding an emotional high after a last-minute Chase Gardi field goal helped them upend previously undefeated MacArthur, 16-14, to win the Nassau Conference II title last week.
MacArthur had stopped Garden City's Long Island record 42-game win streak in week six. The Trojans are on the cusp of history after exacting revenge on the Generals.
"We have to run the football successfully," said Lindenhurst's junior middle linebacker Jack Winey, who has 123 tackles. "And we have to play our brand of tight defense where we swarm tackle and punish people."
Lombardo pointed to a defensive unit that includes 6-5, 252-pound end Sunkonmi Agunloye, tackle Nick Passamonte (6-3, 265) and Jeff Perez (5-10, 235) at the nose. The secondary is led by Jaden Barber, Matt Josefson and Warren Dixon.
"We shut out North Babylon to open the season and I knew our defense would take us where we want to go," Lombardo said. "And with consistent defense and special teams here we are -  ready for our shot at redemption."
Will the defense rest or finish the march?
Lindenhurst LIC Results Year, Opponent, Result, Score 2014: Syosset, lost, 35-13 2017: Oceanside, won, 40-23 2018: Garden City, lost, 19-0

Full text: Casino brings great benefits locally
Suffolk Regional Off-Track Betting has made false claims in a misguided lawsuit that could give the wrong impression of Delaware North and its management of Jake's 58 Casino Hotel in Islandia ["Jake's owner: Toss OTB suit," News, Nov. 11].
Delaware North is a family-owned hospitality company and New York is our home, with headquarters in Buffalo and employees across the state. It is a trusted partner of professional sports teams, airport authorities and government organizations, and it is a well-qualified and licensed casino operator that must follow strict regulations.
In 2016, Suffolk OTB was mired in bankruptcy and its gaming project had been rejected in Medford. Delaware North rescued the project by investing $100 million and then worked with Islandia to locate the gaming venue there. In just a few years, Delaware North's investment and management have made Jake's 58 highly successful and a community asset, providing:
An annual $25 million revenue allocation for Suffolk County's budget, beginning in 2020.
About $220 million in aid to the New York State Education Fund since 2017.
A significant property tax cut for Islandia taxpayers as a result of Delaware North and Suffolk OTB paying the village $47 million over 20 years.
More than 400 good jobs.
A $1.5 million donation to develop Islandia's First Responders Field and $100,000 to dozens of other charitable organizations.
Delaware North is committed to the success of Jake's 58, helping the community and providing a great gaming and hospitality experience to our thousands of patrons.

Water supply also a reason not to build
A reader wrote that road congestion needs to be reduced before more housing is built on Long Island ["More housing here? Roads are too full," Letters, Nov. 22]. I concur.
Another point to consider is that the availability of clean, fresh water is becoming a problem. I believe that, coupled with the increased pollution of our waters, more condominiums and apartments would just add to the problems facing Long Island.

Concerned by gov's Medicaid deferral
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's plan to deal with a $4 billion-plus shortfall in state Medicaid funding by deferring payments of more than $2.2 billion to the 2020-21 budget reminds me of the "Popeye" cartoon character Wimpy, who said, "I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today" ["Delaying Medicaid payment," News, Nov. 23].
Taxpayers could face higher taxes, more debt and borrowing in coming years to cover all the goodies Cuomo promises. He doesn't seem to believe in pay-as-you-go balanced or transparent budgets.
Only Uncle Sam and California carry more long-term debt than New York. Voters get what they deserve by reelecting Cuomo as governor every four years.
Larry Penner,

Eject unruly fans to send a clear message
I have been a volunteer photographer on the sidelines of Oceanside High School football games for 15 years. Yes, spectators and people on the sidelines have become more expressive, mostly on the varsity level ["Bill aims to protect refs," News, Nov. 25]. Rules need to be updated and enforced, but the notion that we need the assistance of the New York State Legislature is absurd.
At the beginning of every varsity game, the home team announces the rules governing spectator behavior. I see plenty of security personnel and supervisors from both schools to enforce the rules.
We don't need our state government to pass laws to stiffen penalties for spectators and coaches who abuse referees. We just need to eject unruly people without first giving them a warning. Bad behavior will stop the next week.
Tommy Gregoretti,

No presidential candidate is perfect
A reader wrote that he did not like either major-party candidate for president in 2016, so he wrote in Thomas Jefferson ["Where is objectivity in Trump hearings?," Letters, Nov. 25]. This answer was ridiculous. Way to shirk your responsibility with a useless vote.
We are supposed to vote for the person we feel is most qualified, not waste a vote in protest or humor. The reader might as well have written in Donald Duck.
Perfection doesn't exist. Even our most beloved presidents have made mistakes.
Electing a president is not a joking matter. A voter should take this privilege seriously or stay away from the voting booth. Such a voter wastes our time with an attempt at humor. Man up and make a decision.

Full text: BABYLON TOWN
Zoning for a medical cannabis dispensary
The Town of Babylon is proposing a code amendment to pave the way for a medical marijuana dispensary to open in East Farmingdale.
Town officials support a plan by Acreage Holdings to locate its fourth dispensary, called "The Botanist," at 2635 Broadhollow Rd. It would be only the second such dispensary in Suffolk County. The other, on Main Street in Riverhead, is run by Columbia Care.
The town code would need to be adjusted to allow such dispensaries in business zoning. The current code could be interpreted to mean that medical marijuana dispensaries - like vape shops and hookah lounges - are only allowed in industrial areas.
With the amendment, town officials are "clearly clarifying our code to not cause a potential issue or clash with our code," spokesman Kevin Bonner said.
The Babylon Town Board will hold two public hearings at 3:30 p.m. on Feb. 13 to consider the code amendments allowing the dispensaries in business districts, with a special exception from the town Zoning Board of Appeals.
The business would not be allowed within 500 feet of a residence, school, library, park, church or playground.
New Yorkers with qualifying conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, PTSD, chronic pain and to treat opioid use, can apply for the state-run program.
Patients must get a medical marijuana-trained doctor's referral, then apply for a state Department of Health ID card before they can access the treatment.
The hearings will be at Town Hall, 200 E. Sunrise Highway in Lindenhurst.

NORTH SEA
Street renamed at request of fire dept.
Southampton Town will rename a North Sea street to avoid confusion, particularly for first responders, as two hamlet roads share the name.
The Shore Drive on the northern coast of the hamlet between Bayview Drive and Edgemere Drive will now be known as West Shore Drive. The change was requested by the North Sea Volunteer Fire Department, said Town Councilman Tommy John Schiavoni.
The name change will affect five developed parcels and three vacant parcels, according to a town board resolution on the matter. Two of the properties are owned by the town.
The town board voted 5-0 in favor of the change at its Jan. 22 meeting.

Cleanup required
at dry cleaner's site
A reporthas recommendedthat the site ofa dry cleaning businessin Oceanside where contaminants were found undergo an environmental cleanup, according to a fact sheet released by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.
An initial investigation in 2014 into the brownfield site,Jay's Lucky Cleaners,found chlorinated solvents in the groundwater beneath the business,which occupiesa retail space in a small strip mall on Long Beach Road.
A subsequent investigation from 2016 to 2018 found the chlorinated solventstetrachloroethylene and trichlorethylenein soil vapor, according to the fact sheet.
"Based on the supplemental investigation work conducted at the site, the NYSDEC, in consultation with the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), has determined that the site poses a significant threat to the public health or the environment," the fact sheet reads.
The DEC will now review the report, which was prepared by an outside environmental consulting firm, DEC spokeswoman Aphrodite Montalvo said. If the agency approves it, the property owner "may then develop a cleanup plan," according to the fact sheet.
Jay's Lucky Cleaners did not respond to a request for comment.

HUNTINGTON TOWN
Teich House gets a more complete name
The Huntington Town Board has voted 5-0 to rename a historic property in Huntington Station the Dr. and Mrs. Samuel Teich House.
The building, one of the town's historic landmarks, was originally called the Dr. Samuel Teich House, and family members had lobbied to have Beatrice Teich recognized in the history.
The board approved the renaming at the Jan. 29 board meeting.
Teich, a physician and obstetrician, worked in the building on New York Avenue from 1935 to 1985, delivering generations of Huntington residents alongside his wife.

OYSTER BAY TOWN
Rec program charge for nonresident kids
Oyster Bay will begin charging nonresident children who have a town resident caregiver an additional $50 to participate in Oyster Bay's summer recreation program this year.
The town board approved the higher rates - $450 for one nonresident child and $250 for additional nonresident children - at its Jan. 29 meeting.
"This is a new opportunity being offered to nonresident children whose caregivers live in the town of Oyster Bay," town spokesman Brian Nevin wrote in an emailed statement. Last year's application to the program did not mention a residency requirement for participation, but it did require the parent or guardian to submit a utility or tax bill. Nevin did not respond to questions about how many children participated in the program in 2018.
Last year the summer program ran from early July to mid-August and included activities such as sports, arts and crafts, a scavenger hunt, sprinkler and pizza parties and theme days, according to the town website. The activities are held at town parks and serve children 4 to 12 years old. Rates for resident children stayed the same as last year at $400 for the first child and $200 for additional children.

Adelphi Partners With Mineola School District to Meet the Need for Substitute Teachers

Publication info: Targeted News Service ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]07 Feb 2019.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2177107786?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Adelphi University issued the following news:
Every day, Long Island schools scramble to find substitute teachers. With a teacher shortage, a declining enrollment in education programs, a strong economy and low unemployment, there are fewer candidates in the subbing pool. Nassau BOCES District Superintendent Dr. Robert Dillon told Newsday, "Based on my anecdotal experience, on any given day there is a need for a minimum of 1,000 substitute teachers throughout Nassau County."
Districts are partnering with universities, including Adelphi, and our efforts were recently featured in both Newsday and on CBS News.
Under a partnership between the College of Education and Health Sciences and the Mineola, Oceanside and Freeport school districts as well as New York City Department Of Education Public School 253Q, respectively, an education major--usually in the fifth year and looking to earn a master's degree--spends a year with the district, student teaching four days a week and substituting on the fifth day.
"The residency program was developed primarily to enrich the clinical experience of our teacher candidates," explained Mirella Avalos-Louie, Ed.D., director of the College's Office of Professional Experiences and Community Engagement. "The year-long experience better prepares our candidates for their first year of teaching." After hearing about the high demand for substitute teachers, the program was refined to help districts fill this need, as "our teacher candidates are already familiar with their schools, curriculum and community," she added.
Newsday interviewed Jackie Jahelka, '17, M.A. '18, and James Bulva, M.A. '18, both of whom are now permanent substitute teachers in the Mineola district. CBS News featured Jahelka and Anne Mungai, Ph.D., interim dean of the College of Education and Health Sciences, who told reporter Jennifer McLogan, "Becoming a teacher is a noble profession. It changes nations. It changes families. It changes people."

Full text: Making it big on New York City stages seems like child's play for these Long Islanders. One, in fact, is a child making his Broadway debut before he's even learned to walk, while two others are bringing smiles to kids' faces with shows that are family-friendly favorites.
RYDER KOEHLE 7 monthscq/db, Oceanside THE GIG He plays an infant in "The Ferryman" on Broadway. HIS STORY Ryder got his show-biz start after his mom, Courtney Pincus-Koehle, who runs Oceanside-based theater school To the Stage, was sent a casting call for the show. After a Facetime meeting with producers followed by an in-person audition, Ryder was hired at 6 months, the legal minimum age for appearing on stage. Ryder, part of a brood of seven in the show, has a few scenes in the first two acts of the three-act play. "It has been great for him to interact with the other kids and he gets so much attention. Plus there's a goose and a rabbit in the show. When we're at home he's almost bored," jokes his mom. Another perk: after seeing the show, Syosset-raised filmmaker Judd Apatow mentioned Ryder on his Instagram page. WHAT'S NEXT While it's too soon to know if Ryder will keep acting, his salary is being saved for his college education, says Pincus-Koehle. SYNDEE WINTERS 32, from Brentwood THE GIG She plays Nala on Broadway in "The Lion King" HER STORY Winters first tried out for Nala in 2008, but didn't make the cut. Two years later, she auditioned again and landed the part in the North American tour before making her Broadway debut in the show in 2012. After roles in two more Broadway shows - "Motown the Musical" and "Pippin" - Winters was the principal standby in "Hamilton." "I was in the theater every show, and in the event one of the actors was not available, I went on," she says. During the run, she appeared as all of the Schuyler sisters. Last year, Winters appeared in NBC's popular "Jesus Christ Superstar Live" and she's also toured with her one-woman show on Lena Horne. WHAT'S NEXT Winters hopes at some point to take a European vacation and to tour with her recently released jazz album "Lessons From a Lady." MARC BUJNICKI 44, from Wading River THE GIG He's the associate producer of "Sesame Street Live! Make Your Magic" at Madison Square Garden's Hulu Theater Friday through Feb. 24. HIS STORY Before his current job as director of production for Feld Entertainment, the company behind "Sesame Street Live!," Bujnicki worked as a TV producer for 24 years. His credits include specials starring Lionel Richie, Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett and Rod Stewart. With "Sesame Street Live!," he was involved in creating the show's concept and working the writers and sceneic designers. "When you get the opportunity to work on a show like 'Sesame Street Live!' and you get the instant gratification, there's nothing like it," he says. "When you start hearing kids scream for Elmo like he's this amazing rock star, it just puts a smile on your face." WHAT'S NEXT Bujnicki, who now lives in Tampa, Florida, is looking forward to being in New York for the show and getting to visit his family who still live on Long Island.

Schwartz triggers 6-run 2nd: Haag holds fort on mound in 'Pequa victory

Author: Sarra, Gregg

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This is Tom Sheedy's favorite time of the season. The longtime Massapequa coach who has led the Chiefs to two Class AA state championships relishes the postseason.
The defending state champions always seem to peak at just the right time for the playoffs.
Nick Schwartz's two-run double keyed a six-run second inning and Massapequa went on to beat East Meadow, 8-4, to sweep the Nassau Class AA semifinal best-of-three series Saturday on the road. It was the 10th straight win for the Chiefs.
Most impressive about the six-run rally put together by the two-time defending Long Island Class AA champions was that it all came about with two outs.
"We're a team that loves to compete and two-out rallies are special," Sheedy said. "Our guys pull it all together at this time of year. We know what we have and who can fill what roles for the team to be successful. We're playing really good baseball right now."
And that's dangerous for any teams in the Chiefs' path.
Massapequa (19-4) will meet the winner of Monday's Game 3 between Port Washington and Oceanside for the Class AA crown. Oceanside, which handed Massapequa its last loss this season, 7-6, in extra innings, forced a Game 3 by beating Port Washington on Saturday.
Massapequa's Wade Kelly opened the two-out scoring with an RBI single before Schwartz followed with a long two-run double to the gap in left-centerfield to make it 3-0. Travis Honeyman also added an RBI double and Dan Wolf hit an RBI single.
East Meadow starter Matt Fried was victimized by three errors in the inning and was tagged with six unearned runs.
"We put together a nice string of four hits and produced a big inning," Sheedy said. "But the defense made a few mistakes and that hurt them."
Massapequa scratched across a run in the fourth to make it 7-0.
East Meadow got on the board when Tyler Patterson hit a one-out double, advanced to third on a wild pitch and scored on a groundout to make it 7-1. The Chiefs added another run in the fifth on pinch hitter Tom Fasano's run-scoring single for an 8-1 lead.
Massapequa senior starter Derek Haag tired in the sixth and the Jets scored three more runs. Haag went 5 1/3 innings and allowed four hits, four walks and struck out one. He improved to 5-0 but was chased by a Sean Kennedy RBI double and a Charlie Cucchiara two-out, run-scoring single to make it 8-4.
Haag got help from sophomore lefty Liam Carroll, who came on in relief and closed it out with a neat 1 2/3 innings for the Chiefs.
"It really is about the journey and to compete for a county championship," Sheedy said. "And what happens along the way determines how and who we play in the postseason. There are many ways to get to that end. And we're not sure who's going to contribute and how, but that's for us to figure out."

Mallah keys EM: Scores go-ahead run as Jets claim Nassau AA title

Author: O'Brien, Owen

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]02 June 2019: 10.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amy Mallah wasn't taking her eye off the play. Not even for a second.
With East Meadow trailing by one run in the top of the seventh inning with Mallah as the go-ahead run on first base and Julianna Sanzone on second, Amanda Thompson hit a line-drive single to the outfield, driving in Sanzone. But Mallah read the play and once she saw a throwing error on the relay, she broke for the plate.
"I just knew it was a tied score," said Mallah, who went 3-for-4 with two runs scored. "I saw the opportunity to go home and be ahead and I knew that I had to do it for my team. That's what I had to do in order for us to win and I just gave it my all and it worked out."
Mallah slid in safely to give East Meadow a one-run lead in its 7-5 victory over Oceanside.
That completed a two-game sweep of the Sailors as East Meadow won its third-straight Nassau Class AA softball championship late Saturday afternoon at Hofstra.
Top-seeded East Meadow entered the seventh inning trailing 5-4, but the Jets had the top of the order due up. And Thompson was ready when it was her time to make a game-altering play.
"It shows that we're not going to stop," Thompson said. "We'll bend but won't break. If we're down, we're always in the mindset of gamemode."
With the victory, East Meadow (18-4) advances to play the winner of Sunday's Commack-Longwood game in the Long Island Class AA championship/Southeast regional final Friday at 7 p.m. at the Eastport South Manor Athletic Complex.
Second-seeded Oceanside (14-11) scored five runs in the third inning, highlighted by Ashley Corr's two-run single.
But the Jets scored one run in the fifth inning on Stephanie Christoforatos' RBI single and three runs in the sixth inning.
"The kids kept fighting, what can I tell you," coach Stew Fritz said. "They're a special group. I really give them all the credit."
Isabella Shepherd added an RBI single in the seventh inning for East Meadow's final run.
"I knew I needed to get another run in, keep the lead going," Shepherd said. "Keep us up and keep going."
And even when East Meadow trailed early, the Jets never lost confidence they'd come back - something Fritz credits to "championship pedigree."
"I said to them in the circle, I knew we were going to come back," Mallah said. "I said 'I have confidence in us, I know we'll do it' and that's exactly that we did."

Red Lobster to replace Joe's Crab Shack at Tanger Outlets

Author: Parrish, Tory N

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]14 June 2019.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tanger Outlets Deer Park lost its seafood restaurant nearly two years ago but another one is lined up to take its place this summer.
A Red Lobster will be serving up the chain's famous cheddar bay biscuits in a freestanding building that Joe's Crab Shack vacated in August 2017, said Nancy Larson, general manager for the shopping center.
The new eatery will occupy a 7,000-square-foot building at 1700 The Arches Circle.
"The anticipated opening for the 245-seat restaurant will be late summer," said Samantha Bruno, spokeswoman for Orlando, Florida-based Red Lobster Seafood Co.
The largest seafood restaurant chain in the country, Red Lobster has more than 700 locations in the United States and Canada, including six on Long Island.
Joe's Crab Shack, however, no longer has a presence on Long Island.
Houston-based Ignite Restaurant Group abruptly closed at least 40 of its Joe's Crab Shack locations, including those in Westbury and Deer Park, in 2017 after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Two other Long Island locations - Riverhead and Oceanside - closed in 2016.
Houston-based Landry's Inc., a large restaurant and casino company, won its bankruptcy auction bid to buy Ignite for $57 million in 2017.
There are now 54 Joe's Crab Shack locations, compared to more than 135 in September 2014.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Herbert Klein, a decorated World War II veteran who fought Nazis in Europe and the Japanese in the Philippines, and who cherished his independence, driving his old Toyota Corolla until his final years, died Thursday. He was 96.
Klein, of Oceanside, was surrounded by family when he died of congestive heart failure at Long Island Jewish Valley Stream, his grandson-in-law Daren Lubin, of Malverne, said.
Klein served in the U.S. Army for more than two years, and was awarded several medals, including the World War II Victory Medal and the American Service Medal, his granddaughter Dana Molino, of Malverne, said.
One time, a Nazi came up to him and asked for a cigarette because Klein had some in his shirt pocket. Klein took the cigarettes, crushed them and threw them at the floor. The Nazi walked away, Molino said. 
"He was basically tough, so tough that he didn't care," Dana Molino said. 
Born Sept. 26, 1922, Klein was raised in the Bronx and attended high school in the area. He met Bernice Klein at a dance and they soon married. 
Around the age of 20, he left to fight in the war. After his return, Klein and his wife settled in Flushing, Queens. He joined the trade business, working for import-export company Oxford Resources for nearly 50 years. He became vice president of the company, and retired in 1987.
About 12 years later, Klein and his wife moved to Orlando. In 2003, they moved back to New York, this time to Oceanside. Bernice, his wife of about 68 years, died in 2013. 
Family members remembered Klein as selfless and giving. He took them on vacations, Lubin said, and called his daughter several times a day to make sure the great-grandchildren were okay.
"He treated me like a grandson," Lubin said. "He would always speak to me on the phone after work. I work an intense job myself, and he would always calm me down."
Klein also was independent-minded.
"He was 96 years old and still driving," Molino said. "He drove everywhere; he went to the supermarket by himself. He wouldn't let anybody help him."
His 26-year-old Toyota Corolla - a symbol of independence - was so important to him, she said, that he treated it like a Mercedes, inquiring about his car even from his hospital bed.
Klein also enjoyed hobbies such as gambling, traveling and consuming the news. His favorite newspaper was Newsday, a paper he read since his younger days in the Bronx, Lubin said.
Besides his granddaughter and grandson-in-law, Klein is survived by his daughter Roberta Molino, grandchildren Danielle Molino-Lubin and Richard Molino, and two great-grandchildren, all of Malverne.
A memorial service was held Sunday at Gutterman's

Juan C. Vides | General Election, November 6, 2018

Full text: Juan C. Vides
Democratic
BACKGROUND: Vides, 41, of Oceanside, is running on the Democrat party line and is a computer programmer. Vides owns and operates a web design and internet marketing business in Oceanside. Vides was born in El Salvador and was brought to the United States by his parents at age four. He attended Long Beach Public Schools K-12 and is a 1995 graduate of Long Beach High School. Vides earned an associate degree in Liberal Arts from Nassau Community College, and a bachelor of science degree in computer programming from Farmingdale State College. He earned about 30 credits toward a master's degree in marketing at Stony Brook University, but left school to start a business. He served from 2012 to 2018 on the board of the Long Island chapter of the American Heart Association, and from 2016 to 2018 was on the board of directors of the Bethpage Federal Credit Union. He also served on the board of the Long Island Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Vides is married.
ISSUES: Vides said he's seeking public office for the first time in part as a response to recent, high-profile government corruption scandals. "People are frustrated with politics and frustrated with their leaders, and a lot of empty promises," Vides said. "We have a lot of representatives walking out of courthouses." Vides said he has given up prestigious positions to run for the Assembly. "I served on two boards and on the boards of chambers of commerce, but I am willing to give everything up to become a public servant," Vides said. He said, if elected, he would attempt to "restore faith and trust" in a political system he takes pride in being a part of. "I count my blessings every day that I am in this country," Vides said. Vides said, however, that like many Americans he has been angered by federal immigration policy that has separated children from their parents. He said, "We have a responsibility to take care of the [immigrant] kids."

Full text: Resources for safe medication disposal
A reader expressed disappointment that his local pharmacy will not take back his unused medications for safe disposal .
He should know that all Suffolk County police precincts have safe drug-disposal containers in their lobbies, including the 5th Precinct, near the writer's home. In addition, some ambulance companies sponsor medication-disposal events or can provide information on disposal sites.
There also are local coalitions dedicated to preventing substance abuse. Many host events where people can dispose of medications safely. Look at the website of the Long Island Prevention Resource Center (liprc.org) for a list of coalitions and contact information.
Lynette Murphy, Patchogue
Editor's note: The writer is project coordinator of the COMPASS Unity Coalition, serving the South Country area in Suffolk County.
Gillibrand should resign as senator
So Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand wants to run for president .
On Oct. 25, she was asked at a debate whether she would run for the higher office. "I will serve my six-year term," she said. She was re-elected to the Senate 12 days later.
I am a lifelong Democrat. Unfortunately, I was duped into voting for Gillibrand, believing her pledge to serve her full Senate term. Her 180-degree flip illustrates exactly why people dislike politicians. They lie too often. Look at the current president.
If Gillibrand really wants to run for president, she should resign her Senate seat immediately and allow the governor to appoint someone who will not put personal goals ahead of the residents of New York.
These are tough times. The Trump administration's tax law revisions will hurt too many New Yorkers, and we need two full-time senators in Washington when votes are being counted, not an absentee, self-serving senator.
If Gillibrand does persist in running, she will not get my vote - and I vote in primary elections.
Andrew J. Sparberg, Oceanside
Kirsten Gillibrand was emphatic in saying she was committed to serving her full 6-year term as a senator. Now she is running for president. These decisions are not made quickly, and I believe she lied just to win her election. This was fraud. If she wins, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo will choose her replacement. We will get a senator that New York did not vote for. All her time and effort for the next two years will be on her campaign, not serving New Yorkers. She should resign immediately. If she wins the presidency, New Yorkers get an appointee of the governor. If she loses, she keeps her job. That is a win-win for her, but New York loses either way.

Nassau GOP created the assessment mess
Richard Nicolello, leader of the Republican majority in the Nassau County Legislature, has it backward if he thinks his party is the voice of the people .
Where was that voice when Edward Mangano, as county executive, threw the whole system (not to mention the county's finances) into disarray by freezing assessments, and then directing blanket settlements of grievances?
The Nassau GOP has been the least transparent group in our local government. Just ask the Nassau Interim Finance Authority. The GOP in general continually fails to adequately govern, but is highly critical (and often obstructionist) when the other side tries to govern. The people need and want cooperation from both sides, not continual criticism or obstruction from one side or the other.
Denis O'Driscoll, Westbury
Feeding gulls makes them aggressive
Nice picture of a retiree feeding the seagulls .
Yet, it might not be a good idea. Seagulls are done a disservice by being fed human food, which can harm animals and interfere with their instincts to get food as nature intended. It also conditions birds to be aggressive by stalking humans instead of staying away from them.
Once at the beach, a seagull in flight swooped down from behind and snatched a sandwich as I was about to take a bite. I believe this was a result of humans interfering with nature.
Jim Brennan, Rocky Point
Unhappy about more money for schools
Great news: If there is anything our public schools need, it's more money from me. At least it will come out of my left pocket, not my right .
What will this money do except buy votes? Give each school a dome over their AstroTurf fields?
I honestly can't think of anything else we can spend more money on for local schools. Wait, I got it, hire even more voters, I mean teachers and administrators. We would just have to expand each school to handle the influx. While we are at it, let's fatten up their pensions.

Mahler and mayhem

Full text: Handling the pressure of the Syosset girls basketball team can be stressful.
With freshman Lilah Grubman forcing the issue at the front of the press, the Braves force turnovers and wreak havoc.
Call it, 'mayhem.'
"Our press is called 'mayhem,' so that's something we emphasize a lot," said senior Rachel Mahler, who had 20 points in host Syosset's 67-18 win over Oceanside in Nassau AA-I on Saturday. "We create chaos and we make the other teams flustered."
Syosset (8-0) routinely keeps teams under 40 points, in large part to its defensive tenacity. The Braves are able to shoot a high percentage with the easy transition baskets that come from the turnovers they force, as was the case against Oceanside (2-5).
When Syosset isn't scoring off its press, it's running a complex pick-and-roll half-court set. Uncommon at the high school level (especially at the frequency the Braves run it), the pick-and-roll is just as difficult to defend as it is to execute.
Syosset coach Michael Ferreira said he has the "high-IQ" athletes to make it work.
"Instead of giving them plays to run, we try to teach them how to play the game of basketball and have them make reads," he said. "We read what the defense gives us, then have our girls make plays."
With forwards crashing from either elbow, all Kendall Halpern (six points) and Caroline Ruggiero (six) have to do is wait for the perfect moment to hit them in stride.
"Inside, we have two bigs who do almost everything," Halpern said. "It makes our lives so much easier if we're going to dump it inside. It just fits our team."
It all culminates in a well-rounded Braves attack. Ferreira said he has the depth this season to rest his starters, keeping them fresh for potentially crucial moments at the end of games.
He had 10 players score against the Sailors, seemingly all of whom grasp the brand of basketball Syosset wants to play.
"Our idea is that we just want to keep teams up-tempo and wear them down over the course of four quarters," Ferreira said. "We believe that if we're playing our mayhem style of pressure defense, eventually it will take its toll on them."
With "off the charts" athleticism, according to Halpern, Syosset has its sights set on a conference championship and a push for a county title.
The Braves hope to cause mayhem against Nassau's top teams.
Said Halpern: "In that fourth quarter, we're looking to run people down.

Another LI location shut in bankruptcy case

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A newly closed Mattress Firm store in Oceanside is among 99 locations in the retailer's second round of closures as part of its bankruptcy protection filing.
The 4,000-square-foot store, which was once a Sleepy's - the Hicksville-based mattress retail chain was acquired for $780 million by Mattress Firm two years ago - was located on 3150 Long Beach Rd. The property is owned by United Properties Corp. in East Meadows.
A public relations representative for Mattress Firm, when contacted about the closing of the Oceanside store, didn't provide updated information. 
Houston-based Mattress Firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal court in Delaware on Sept. 28, citing market saturation and competition from online mattress retailers, among other factors. 
At the time, Mattress Firm said it planned to close up to 700 stores around the country. 
A 6,525-square-foot Mattress Firm store in Plainview, located at 1040 Old Country Rd. in Morton Village Plaza, closed in early September. 
Patrick Collins, a partner at Uniondale law firm Farrell Fritz, who specializes in bankruptcy and restructuring, said that in a changing retail landscape competition from the "Amazon effect" and other retailers continues to hurt many businesses. 
In recent years Mattress Firm aggressively purchased competitors, expanding to more than 3,000 stores. The company has more than $1 billion in liabilities and a long list of creditors, according to court documents. It owes its largest creditor, mattress maker Simmons Manufacturing Co., close to $65 million. 
Even so, Mattress Firm could emerge from bankruptcy as a stronger company, Collins said.
"The plan Mattress Firm has in place is smart in that it lets the company retain ownership, leverage the provision of the bankruptcy code that limits landlord rejection damage claims, and allows it to negotiate or terminate leases in oversaturated areas," he said. 
"This means the company has an opportunity to 'right size' and reorganize their business without s

One mattress at a time: Recycling entrepreneur was inspired to start work 'to make the Earth better'

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Christine Kiourtsis got the first bit of inspiration for her mattress recycling business when walking through her East Rockaway neighborhood. On a bright spring day, soiled mattresses and box springs strewn over an open field marred her view of Bay Park.
"I thought, this has to be dangerous," Kiourtsis said.
Five years later, Kiourtsis, 46, saves hundreds of mattresses annually from ending up in landfills with the help of a six-member crew. The Lynbrook native owns and operates Renewable Recycling Inc., a recycling company and waste transfer station that helps towns, hotels and other companies   unload mattresses.
"I believe we can make the earth better, one mattress at a time," she said.
The company has bulk-waste contracts with the Town of Hempstead and agreements with several hotel chains in New York City, according to Kiourtsis. It has reclaimed more than 1,700 tons of mattress materials since it started in 2014.
More than 85 percent of mattress components are recyclable, according to the Mattress Recycling Council, based in Alexandria, Virginia.
In June, the company hauled away nearly 1,000 twin-size mattresses from Stony Brook University as the school spruced up some of its dorms.
Currently there is no legislation that mandates mattress recycling on Long Island, but Stony Brook makes it a policy to change mattresses in dorms every five to six years, according to Lisa Gumbman, assistant director of residential financial services.
More than 50,000 mattresses end up in landfills every day, and do not easily biodegrade, according to the Mattress Recycling Council. Kiourtsis said it takes 90 years for them to decompose.
"Our landfills are saturated," Kiourtsis said.
In Renewable Recycling's 2,000-square-foot warehouse in Oceanside, employees strip each mattress down to its wire coils. Mattress technician Gregory Mojica, 19, of East Rockaway said he starts his workday as early as 7:45 a.m., unloading mattresses and carting them into the warehouse to be deconstructed.
He uses a box cutter to slice open each mattress, and then removes the foam, cotton and wool shoddy (padding) and metal coils by hand. Mojica said he has dismantled more than 50 since joining the company a year ago.
"It's a dirty job, but it's worth it, and it's for a good cause," he said.
The company, which Kiourtsis said recently turned from break-even to profitable, earns revenue on both ends of the deal.  The firm charges hotels, universities and other bulk suppliers from $6 to $14.50 per mattress, depending on volume and whether they are dropped off at the warehouse or the firm picks them up.
The company also offers mattress pickup for individuals on Long Island and in New York City, priced from $35 to $90 depending on the distance.   
Employees bundle and bale the reclaimed materials, which are sold to vendors by the pound. Prices for the foam, cotton, wool and metal fluctuate depending on market conditions, with average rates ranging from 7.25 cents to 13 cents per pound,  Kiourtsis said. 
The company salvages approximately 425 tons of re-purposed materials per year.  
Part of Renewable Recycling's mission has also become helping families in need.
In July, the company donated 100 of the mattresses from Stony Brook University that were in good condition to Open Door Exchange, a Setauket nonprofit that offers free furniture for those in need.
Mattresses are the most requested item, said the nonprofit's director, Kate Jones Calone. "Many of the mattresses go to children, and ensuring they get a good night's sleep means better productivity in school," she said.
California, Connecticut and Rhode Island are the only states that have enacted laws encouraging mattress recycling.
Kiourtsis hopes New York lawmakers will follow suit and mandate mattress recycling. So far she has reached out to New York City lawmakers to discuss implementing a statewide mattress rec

Historic marker returned: Missing gravestone of Revolutionary War veteran located

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Twenty years ago, Roy Ruland tramped through the overgrown grass at the Waverly Avenue Cemetery, brushing clean the faces of gravestones.
His brother assured him that Rev. Luke Ruland, their distant relative tracing back seven generations, was buried somewhere in the Patchogue cemetery. But after looking for hours, Ruland never found the sandstone marker.
"It disappeared," said Ruland, 54, a retired NYPD detective from Oceanside. "Someone ran off with it."
On Tuesday, Ruland  saw the gravestone for the first time lying in the trunk of Lynn Davis' car. It was broken at its base and spotted with lichen, but the inscription was still clear - the stone belonged to Rev. Luke Ruland.
"It's a miracle," he said.
The stone was anonymously returned a couple months ago to the Burying Ground Preservation Group, a nonprofit in Southampton, according to one of the organization's partners, Zachary Studenroth. After learning Ruland was originally buried in Patchogue, Studenroth contacted Davis, a member of the Cemetery Restoration Committee, which oversees the restoration of five historic cemeteries within the village.
Davis posted a photo of the headstone on Facebook, where it was seen by Roy's brother Steve, also a retired NYPD officer who now lives in Hopewell Junction, New York. He began researching his family tree in the 1990s and had visited the Waverly Avenue Cemetery to look for Luke Ruland's grave. By searching through records, he learned that his ancestor served as part of a militia in the Battle of Brooklyn during the Revolutionary War and became the pastor of the Baptist Church in Patchogue in the 1790s.
"I knew it right away," said Steve Ruland, 56, of seeing the headstone on Facebook. "That was it."
Last week, Davis met with Roy Ruland at the burying ground, near a cluster of Ruland graves.
They found what they believe is Luke Ruland's footstone, which is made from a similar material and engraved with his initials, L.R.
They hope to excavate in the area to find the grave's location before the ground freezes over. Davis believes the reverend was laid to rest beside Merrit Ruland, where gnarled roots now peek up from below.
Davis thinks the roots eventually toppled Luke Ruland's gravestone, which is thought to be the second oldest at the cemetery. According to the marker, Luke Ruland died in 1809 at the age of 78. There's also a short dedication which was originally inscribed with a typo: "I have finished my curse. I have kept the faith."
An "o" was added at some point to change "curse" to "course."
The restoration committee will raise about $2,000 to repair and erect the gravestone, Davis said. A restoration company will begin working on the gravestone in the coming weeks, and the committee is hoping to hold a rededication ceremony for the Revolutionary War patriot next year on Veterans Day.
"It's important. It's not just something that means a lot to me and my family, but it's part of Long Island's history," Roy R

Grand Slam Challenge: Copiague's Franklin Parra has decisions to make soon: The 6-2, 187-pound lefthander will have to choose between attending San Jacinto or playing minor league ball with whatever team drafts him

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Franklin Parra is a busy guy. The last few weeks have had the Copiague senior's head spinning.
The 6-2, 187-pound lefthanded pitching prospect is juggling pre-draft invites from a variety of major league teams. He along with his potential college baseball coach at San Jacinto are anxiously awaiting the MLB amateur draft on Monday.
His draft slot will determine whether or not San Jacinto loses one of Long Island's top prospects to the pro ranks.
Everything in Parra's future hinges on the immediate future.
"I'll have some big decisions to make very soon," Parra said. "And I've been studying like crazy, so I can graduate on time. That's been the most important thing for me."
On top of everything, Parra was selected to the 14th Grand Slam Challenge pitting Nassau's blue-chip seniors against Suffolk's at 7 p.m. on June 8 at St. Joseph's (L.I.).
Gates will open at 5:30 p.m. and tickets are $10 each with most of the proceeds to benefit the Cohen Children's Hospital.
Parra, who struck out 74 batters in 34 innings this spring, is slated to start the game. The lefty with a 92-mph fastball and nasty curve has been targeted as a top prospect by the Royals, Mets, Phillies and Yankees.
Parra's batterymate will be St. John the Baptist catcher Logan O'Hoppe, the CHSAA Player of the Year, who hit .511.
O'Hoppe, an East Carolina scholarship commit, is also high on MLB draft boards as one of the top catching prospects in the northeast.
Parra and O'Hoppe hope to join a long list of Long Islanders who've played in this game and gone on to professional baseball, including major leaguers Nick Tropeano (Angels), Danny Barnes (Blue Jays), Marcus Stroman (Blue Jays) and Steven Matz (Mets).

Tyler Ammirato gets one more chance to play football in Empire Challenge: The free safety will be defensive captain of the Long Island All-Stars, who will be playing against New York City's stars Friday night at Hofstra before playing lacrosse at Marist

Author: Herzog, Bob

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The last traces of Tyler Ammirato's football DNA will be left on the turf at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium on Friday night.
"It's kind of sad, but it's great to strap on the helmet and pads one more time," said Ammirato, named the Long Island team's defensive caption on Thursday after the final practice before the 23rd Empire Challenge that will match Long Island and New York City in a charity All-Star football game that kicks off at 7 p.m. Long Island leads the series 12-8 (the first two were between Nassau and Suffolk), but the City has won the last two years.
"We've been having fun the whole week, but we want to win," said Ammirato, who played at Miller Place while his father, Vin, coached at Mount Sinai. Even with that pedigree, Tyler, a 5-7, 170-pound free safety, will play lacrosse in college at Marist. "I grew up watching my dad's teams. I love football. But my lacrosse coach at Marist just texted me and said, 'Go kick some butt. Don't hold back.' "
It's that attitude that earned Ammirato the nod as defensive captain, quarterback Tommy Heuer (Oceanside/Cortland) as offensive captain and running back/kick returner Dylan Laube (Westhampton/New Hampshire) as special teams captain.
"From Day 1 of practice, Tyler proved he had football savvy," defensive coordinator Kyle Madden (Half Hollow Hills West) said. "His Dad is a football coach. It's in his blood. You could see how smart he was, making the checks on defense and putting people in the right spots. The kids who are going to play another sport in college plays as hard, or harder, than anyone else. Tyler is the epitome of that."
Laube epitomizes the team-first attitude of these all-stars. At Westhampton, which used the wing-T under Bill Parry, who is the coach for the Long Island squad, Laube was the primary ball-carrying option and often carried 40 times a game. "This is a lot different from Westhampton," Laube said with a laugh. "It's cool. Instead of the wing-T, we're running the spread and I get to do everything. Swing passes, wheel routes, inside handoffs, some lead blocking. That's what I'll need to do in college."
Laube also can be a potential game-breaker with his elusiveness on returns. "I'll be looking for a big moment," he said with a grin. "Maybe the first play? On the opening kickoff? Set the tone."
Heuer (Oceanside) will start at quarterback and rotate series with Nick Anzalone (Lindenhurst) and Ryan Walsh (Northport). The player who is moving the team best usually gets the bulk of the work in the second half. Heuer had an advantage in that the offensive coordinator for this game is his high school coach, Rob Blount. "The transition was simple for me," Heuer said. "It's the same system. Our receivers are talented and can make plays. I hope I have the hot hand."
He's already had the helping hand. "Tommy has been lights out in practice," Blount said. "He's been a big asset since he knows the system and has helped the other quarterbacks, who came from different systems."
With no blitzing or lineman stunts allowed, according to the rules established by the game's founder, former NFL star Boomer Esiason, this game, according to Blount, "is built for quarterbacks."
It's in the Empire Challenge's DNA.

Dylan Laube in full Wildcat mode as LI wins Empire Challenge: Future Wildcat excells in the Wildcat formation

Author: Herzog, Bob

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 June 2018: 28.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last July, after a couple of days contemplating a football scholarship offer from the University of New Hampshire, Dylan Laube made up his mind. "I want to be a Wildcat," he recalled telling his parents.
Nearly a year later, Laube the New Hampshire Wildcat excelled in the Long Island Wildcat, running for three touchdowns and earning Most Outstanding Player honors as Long Island held off New York City, 28-27, Friday night in the 23rd Empire Challenge at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium.
Long Island gave Laube some help late with a bit of trickery. On fourth-and-14, Oceanside quarterback Tommy Heuer handed off to teammate Derek Cruz on a jet sweep, took the toss-back and lofted what proved to be a game-winning 34-yard touchdown pass to Massapequa's Owen Glascoe with 41 seconds left.
New York City hit a magical pass of its own, a 30-yard TD strike from Mike Nicosia to Titus Leo on the last play of regulation, and opted to go for the win. But Sayville's James Lyons broke up the two-point conversion pass in the end zone to preserve the victory, ending a two-year City winning streak. Long Island leads the series, 13-8.
It was a wild ending to a Wildcat-themed evening.
"We set it up on Wednesday, in case there were some goal-line situations," said Laube, the 2017 co-Hansen Award winner for Long Island Class III champion Westhampton.
There were. Three times the New Hampshire Wildcat lined up in the Long Island Wildcat, took a direct snap and provided a red-zone lift. The 6-foot, 195-pound back scored on 5- and- 1-yard bursts in the second quarter and put Long Island ahead 21-14 with another 1-yarder in the third quarter.
Laube did more than run out of the Wildcat. He carried 13 times for 76 yards, returned three kickoffs for 50 yards and caught two passes for 25 yards. His final reception was huge, a 21-yard hookup with Lindenhurst's Nick Anzalone that kept the winning drive alive.
"It's awesome. I'm everywhere on the field," he said with a huge smile. "This is a taste of what it will be like in college."
It was Laube's hunger for football and a stubborn streak that allowed him to fulfill a childhood dream of earning a college football scholarship. He received numerous lacrosse offers as a freshman and sophomore - he was a four-year starter and All-County player - but demurred each time, holding out for football offers. It took until summer football camps after his junior year for colleges to bite. The first nibble came from Brown; New Hampshire later served up a scholarship. "I always said I wanted to play football in college," Laube said. "I'm a positive kid. You can never have a doubt."
Laube was the focal point of a run-first wing-T at Westhampton and had to adapt to the pass-first spread. "For him to come here from a system where he had 40 touches a game and fit in was impressive," offensive coordinator Rob Blount of Oceanside said. "He doesn't mind blocking; we put in a little Wildcat for him. The plan was to get him the ball in space as often as we could."
Which allowed Laube to run wild.

Tattoo festival a big draw: Inky trends, fancy styles make Summer Vibe a work of art

Author: Criblez, David J

Full text: Getting a tattoo might be easy, but choosing one can be tricky. Ink artists from Long Island and across the country will show their portfolios and work on clients at the Summer Vibe Tattoo and Arts Festival June 29-July 1 at NYCB Live's Nassau Coliseum.
Long Island artists working at the festival specialize in a range of styles - and they know the trends.  
POP CULTURE
One of the most common tattoo designs to get these days is a cartoon or movie character.
"People love it," says Adam Perjatel, 31, of Green Apple Tattoo in Island Park. "It's become more popular over the past three to four years."
The resurgence of the "Star Wars" franchise has brought on an influx of galactic tattoo requests.
"People go for the weird-looking creatures," Perjatel says. "They like Darth Maul, General Grievous and Jango Fett. It's so much fun, but it's very challenging, because the color matching involves a lot of research."
Courtney Raimondi, 27, works at Undead Ink NY in Oceanside, specializing in doing what she calls "tattoons" featuring characters from "Sailor Moon," "The Powerpuff Girls," Pokémon and Disney movies.
"People are very connected to nostalgia and things they grew up with," Raimondi says. "It's important to make sure it's done clean and correct to the character. You don't want it to look like the bootleg dollar-store version."
COVER-UPS
Those who have a tattoo that needs new life come to Tommy Helm, owner of Empire State Studio in Amityville. With 22 years of experience, Helm, who has appeared on "Tattoo Nightmares" and "Ink Master," helps those in distress.
"Sometimes people want to cover a tattoo because aesthetically it's not right or it's emotionally tangling for them," says Helm, 44. "Most tattoo artists don't want to do cover-ups because it's way more work than a brand-new tattoo. But if someone needs a cover-up, I'll be there for them and do what I can to help out."
NEW SCHOOL
This is a style of bright colors, bold calligraphic lines, heavy blacks and warped perspective.
"It's fun and interesting to look at. The style really pops on people's skin," says Jared Stomber, 37, who works at Empire State Studio in Amityville. A popular New School tattoo motif is skulls.
"It's a classic image people have been getting for decades," Stomber says. "Skulls can be fun or evil. They can fit any criteria you are looking for."
REALISM
Some artists specialize in duplicating a real object or photo in tattoo form.
"It takes a lot longer than a traditional tattoo," says "Big" Joel MacDonald, 38, owner of Notorious Tattoo Company in Centereach. "When you lay it down you have to make a stencil, which is like a road map telling you where to place shadows and shapes. You have to go over it very methodically with a fine-tooth comb and be very diligent about following the picture."
Mike Carro, 33, owner of Undead Ink NY, specializes in black-and-gray realism because he feels it's real and tangible.
"Black and gray is something everyone can get behind and enjoy. People instantly recognize it. Plus, it has more longevity," says Carro. "You have to put the right amount of contrast with shading. It's a very popular style on Long Island."  
THEMES
After 16 years of tattooing, Po Zhang finally opened his own shop, World Famous Tattoo Art Gallery in West Babylon, this year. "Popo," as he is affectionately known, has built a reputation for his original custom theme tattoos, which are full scenes created on an arm, leg, back or chest with subjects ranging from religion to "Star Trek."
"I help people create a story," says Zhang, 40, who grew up as an oil painter. "I don't copy anybody's work. My customers tell me what they want and I create a new design for them. People are tired of the one-piece tattoo. They like to go big." SUMMER VIBE TATTOO & ARTS FESTIVAL

Building demolitions
to help create parking
The North Hempstead Town Board has approved the demolition of two buildings in Westbury to create more nearby parking for a commercial building at 1025 Old Country Rd.
At its Thursday meeting, the board voted 5-0 (two council members were absent) for the proposed site plan, which would add 108 off-site parking spaces at bordering 19 State St., in Westbury.
Kathleen Deegan Dickson, attorney for 1025 OCR LLC, said at the meeting that the goal was to build "one cohesive parking lot that will serve present and future tenants." She said one building is being used partly as an office building and data center.- CHRISTINE CHUNG
HUNTINGTON STATION
Samuel Teich Housegets landmark status
The Huntington Town Board approved naming The Dr. Samuel Teich House in Huntington Station as a local historic landmark.
The building at 1090 New York Ave. was once used as the office by a doctor who delivered generations of Huntington residents.
The board voted 5-0 at its meeting last Wednesday to make the designation.
The building is used as a residence with attached office space. That is not affected by the designation, but it does prevent the building's demolition or revisions to its exterior architecture, town officials said.
The town's Historic Preservation Committee recommended the designation for the property, where Teich, a physician and obstetrician, worked from 1935 to 1985.
In April, Teich's parents' home, The Max and Rosie Teich Homestead on Academy Place, was granted historic designation by the town.

HUNTINGTON TOWN
Filming permits, fees
amended by board
The Huntington Town Board has voted to tighten rules for production companies that want to film in the town.
The amendments clarify insurance requirements, amend fees for the processing of applications and issuance of film permits and create additional penalties for offenses.
Town officials said the changes would mitigate the impact that film productions have on the town.
They also said the changes would provide more flexibility for issuing filming and production permits and the ability to charge fees without passing town board resolutions first.
The resolution passed 3-2 at last Wednesday's town board meeting.
Board member Gene Cook, an Independent, voted no as part of his protest to vote against the majority of that meeting's resolutions in response to what he says is the mishandling by his board colleagues of the town's lawsuit with the Long Island Power Authority over the Northport Power Plant.
Republican board member Ed Smyth, who sponsored the resolution for the public hearing on the film production amendments, also voted against the measure. He said that while he agrees with the intent of the changes, the language in the resolution was too broad.
"The resolution was very poorly drafted and probably unenforceable," Smyth said. "It included still photography, meaning it requires commercial photographers to get a permit. If somebody wants to go to Heckscher Park and photograph ducks for a wildlife calendar, they would need to come to Town Hall to get a permit. Should code enforcement start questioning anyone with a camera in a public park or beach what the purpose of the photographs will be?"
The board also approved by a 3-2 vote to set fees for film permits and permit applications. The fees will include a nonrefundable application fee as well as full- and half-day permit fees per location.

BROOKHAVEN TOWN
Redesigned website for town debuts
Brookhaven Town has redesigned its website, making it easier for residents to report a problem and get involved in community activities.
Near the top of the home page, brookhavenny.gov, are four options for town meetings, online services, reporting a problem and getting alerts and notifications about town issues.
The tabs allow residents to easily sign up for alerts regarding emergencies or flooding.
Residents can also inform officials about abandoned homes, dog complaints, dead animals in the road and street lighting issues.
The homepage has added links for free environmental programs, the farmers market at Town Hall and the Brookhaven Country Fair this weekend.- DEON J. HAMPTON

We're learning philosophy, thanks to high school kids

Full text: At school we are learning about philosophy. The Oceanside High School kids who are taking philosophy class came into our school to teach us.
Philosophy is the study of knowledge. When they first came into our classroom, they told us the rules of having a discussion in philosophy. The rules are to be nice. If you disagree with someone you say, "I beg to differ," or "I respectfully disagree."
Then the high school kids read us a short book, such as "Frog and Toad," "Frederick," and "The Important Book." The books that they read to us all have philosophy in them. "Frog and Toad" is about being brave. "Frederick" is about teaching a family that there is more to life than just the basics, such as food, water and shelter. "The Important Book" is about the importance of objects. The author wrote about the importance of an apple, saying that it is important because it is round. Also they wrote about a spoon, saying it is important because it is mirrored on the front and back.
After that, we went into smaller groups. Then the high school kids asked us questions like "Is it brave to stand up to a bully?" or "Do you have to have a job to be doing work?" We could never get the answer wrong because there is no wrong answer. The high school kids were always respectful, even though they might not like our answers.
Philosophy is a great thing to learn about. It was a great experience to see how older kids teach younger kids. We hope we can learn more philosophy in the future.

Denise A. Cicione, whose love of nature inspired students, dies: As a science educator at Great Hollow Middle School in Nesconset, she sought to make the world a better place, her family said

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Denise A. Cicione was the type of teacher who would take her students in Nesconset to a nearby park to examine birds and area trees in addition to teaching about such lessons from a book.
She was inspired by the natural world around her, those who knew her said, and brought that love of nature to the students and staff at Great Hollow Middle School, where she was a seventh grade science teacher. Cicione, of Nesconset, died March 30 of a brain aneurysm at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 53.
"Anybody that knew her was touched by her. She was unlike anybody else," said her sister, Teresa Noto, of Nesconset.
Born in Brooklyn, Cicione moved with her family to Oceanside and graduated from Oceanside High School. She studied to become a teacher and received her bachelor's degree in 2007 and her master's in 2009, both from Dowling College.
She worked in the Smithtown school district since 1998, starting as a computer lab assistant. Over the course of her career there, she served as computer lab assistant at Great Hollow, a science teacher assistant at Smithtown High School West and returned to Great Hollow as a science teacher in 2007. In 2012, Cicione became an instructional specialist at the school, officials there said.
She married Neil Cicione in the early 1990s, her sister said. The couple has a son, Joseph, of Nesconset.
Noto recalled that Cicione conducted a classroom project involving bobwhite quails, which are known to eat ticks. She bought quail eggs and using an egg-hatching machine, she raised the quails who were then released nearby.
"She was always looking for ways to make the world a better place," Noto said.
Her colleagues at Great Hollow described Cicione as an inspiration to both students and staff. She had attended workshops at the Manhasset-based Greentree Foundation where she learned more ways to bring nature directly to students.
Cicione led an effort to take the entire seventh grade class - about 300 students - and educators to Charles P. Toner Park for a full-day curriculum spent entirely outdoors. Cicione and assistant principal Cindy Nocero also transformed an empty interior courtyard at the school into an open learning space.
"She was a standout teacher and a leader," Nocero said.
English teacher Nanci Hennes had worked with Cicione for 20 years in the district. Both educators started out in the computer lab.
"She would spend hours after school helping anyone who needed help and always with a smile on her face," Hennes said.
In addition to her husband, son and sister, Cicone is survived by another sister, Grace Zazzaro, of Mystic, Connecticut, and her mother, Lillian Vissichelli, of West Palm Beach, Florida.
A wake was held April 4 at St. James Funeral Home and a funeral Mass was celebrated April 5 at Parish of the Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church in Nesconset. Burial followed at St. Patricks Cemetery in Smithtown.
Contributions in her memory may be made to the Denise Cicione Scholarship Fund, Smithtown Children Foundation, P.O Box 799, Nesconset, N.Y. 11767.

Grand Slam Challenge: Copiague's Franklin Parra has decisions to make soon: The 6-2, 187-pound lefthander will have to choose between attending San Jacinto or playing minor league ball with whatever team drafts him

Full text: Franklin Parra is a busy guy. The last few weeks have had the Copiague senior's head spinning.
The 6-2, 187-pound lefthanded pitching prospect is juggling pre-draft invites from a variety of major league teams. He along with his potential college baseball coach at San Jacinto are anxiously awaiting the MLB amateur draft on Monday.
His draft slot will determine whether or not San Jacinto loses one of Long Island's top prospects to the pro ranks.
Everything in Parra's future hinges on the immediate future.
"I'll have some big decisions to make very soon," Parra said. "And I've been studying like crazy, so I can graduate on time. That's been the most important thing for me."
On top of everything, Parra was selected to the 14th Grand Slam Challenge pitting Nassau's blue-chip seniors against Suffolk's at 7 p.m. on June 8 at St. Joseph's (L.I.).
Gates will open at 5:30 p.m. and tickets are $10 each with most of the proceeds to benefit the Cohen Children's Hospital.
Parra, who struck out 74 batters in 34 innings this spring, is slated to start the game. The lefty with a 92-mph fastball and nasty curve has been targeted as a top prospect by the Royals, Mets, Phillies and Yankees.
Parra's batterymate will be St. John the Baptist catcher Logan O'Hoppe, the CHSAA Player of the Year, who hit .511.
O'Hoppe, an East Carolina scholarship commit, is also high on MLB draft boards as one of the top catching prospects in the northeast.
Parra and O'Hoppe hope to join a long list of Long Islanders who've played in this game and gone on to professional baseball, including major leaguers Nick Tropeano (Angels), Danny Barnes (Blue Jays), Marcus Stroman (Blue Jays) and Steven Matz (Mets).

Officials: Long Island students swept up in statewide data breach: NY Attorney General's office opens investigation after information of 52 students statewide was accessed after 2017 test

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An unauthorized user accessed personal information of 31 Nassau students and 21 others statewide who took a computer-based exam last spring administered by a Minnesota-based testing firm, company and state education officials said Thursday.
The state Attorney General's office has opened an investigation into the data breach that occurred after Questar Assessment Inc. of Apple Valley, Minnesota, administered the statewide test to elementary and middle school students, officials said.
Questar administers New York State standardized tests in English Language Arts and mathematics for elementary and middle school students in grades three through eight.
The data breach was confined to five schools and 52 students, including 21 at John F. Kennedy School Elementary School in Great Neck and 10 more at the Oceanside school district's School #2, state officials said.
Students' names, grade levels, teachers, schools, and their education department identification numbers were viewed in the data breach, said New York State Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia during an afternoon conference call with reporters. However, Social Security numbers and addresses were not accessed, she said.
"This represents a fraction of one percent of the students who were registered for the computer-based testing in the spring of 2017," Elia said. "Any data breach is unacceptable, particularly when we're talking about children's information."
She added that while "this is not something that should put off a red flag for any parent about safety of a child," parents need to be informed of the specifics of the breach, and that the department was "taking steps to hold Questar accountable."
Elia's office has demanded that Questar hire an independent third party to conduct a security audit of the company's protocols and submit those results to the education department by Feb. 20. A corrective action plan, detailing steps taken to remedy the matter and ensure that such a breach doesn't occur again, is due Jan. 26.
Amy Spitalnick, press secretary for State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said, "Families deserve to know that their children's information is safe. We've opened an investigation into the Questar data breach."
In a statement, Questar officials said they intend to cooperate with New York State education officials and implement any recommended changes to prevent another data breach.
"Questar has recently become aware that an unknown person made unauthorized access to Questar systems and to data in our care," the statement said. "Even though access was to a very minor amount of data any unauthorized access to data is unacceptable. Questar took immediate action to address the unauthorized access."
Oceanside Superintendent Phyllis Harrington said in an email that the breach affected sixth graders and praised Elia's office for acting "swiftly."
"This is an unfortunate situation, and of course we are disappointed that such an occurrence took place," she said. "At the local level, our district will make a contact to each family directly once we are given specific names of those affected."
Officials with the Great Neck school district could not immediately be reached for comment.

Aidan Caggiano double-winner in Nassau 'A' Championships: Caggiano takes 3,200 and 1,600 and Manhasset teammate John Cyprus captures 1,000

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Manhasset's Aidan Caggiano knows what he's capable of doing. Thanks to a dominant cross-country season, so does the rest of Nassau County. Caggiano is among the top distance runners, and perhaps the best in the county, and he proved it again Tuesday night.
Caggiano sprinted with 600 meters left to break away from a tightly packed field, coasted the rest of the way and won the 3,200 meters in 10 minutes, 3.3 seconds at the Nassau Class A Championships at St. Anthony's High School. He also won the 1,600 in 4:34.48.
Caggiano was confident about his prospects in both races. So, even when he found himself toward the back of the pack in the 3,200, not a speck of worry appeared on his face.
"I knew if I let them take it out that I'd have enough of a kick at the end," Caggiano said.
A slow pace at the beginning of the 3,200 helped Caggiano conserve energy for the 1,600. The field went through the first 1,000 meters in 3:13 and the first 2,000 in 6:29.
"That's relatively slow," Caggiano said. "As of now, my is around a 9:20, so jogging at that pace felt very easy. I knew at the end that I would be able to push through."
As important as the county championships are, Caggiano has bigger plans. He is looking at the state qualifiers and beyond.
"This isn't really the goal right now," he said after the 3,200. "Me and my coach are focusing on states."
Caggiano's Manhasset teammate, John Cyprus, held off Syosset's Andrew Lafferty in the 1,000. Cyprus ran 2:41.07 and Lafferty was right behind him in 2:41.80.
"I was just trying to close," Cyprus said of the final 60 meters. "I was running with the fast seeds, so I knew I had the kick and the strength for it. I just went out there and raced."
In the field, Massapequa's Kevin Cetin cracked the 50-foot barrier in the shot put for the first time, notching the victory with a 50 foot, 7 inch toss.
"50 feet has always been this magical number that shot putters want to reach before they keep moving on. It felt pretty good," Cetin said.
Oceanside's Anthony Romeo won the 55-meter hurdles in 7.47 seconds, currently the fastest time in the state, according to milesplit.com.
On the girls side, Syosset's Reilly Siebert won the 3,000 in 10:26.44. Siebert spent most of the race locked in a battle with Oceanside's Andria Scaglione and South Side's Carly Woelfel. With 150 meters left, Siebert, done with leaving things to chance, decided to sprint the rest of the way. Scaglione was second in 10:29.44 and Woelfel was third in 10:39.26.
"I wanted to make sure I wasn't going too out of control at the end," Siebert said. "I wanted to the distance, so I could just focus on my form in the last few meters."
Uniondale's Zaria Fuller won the 55-meter hurdles in 8.52 seconds and the 300 in 41.60 seconds. Brianna McGregor won the long jump, flying 17 feet, 1 3/4 inches.

Long Island Vegan Extravaganza coming to Huntington Station: More than 50 exhibitors will be selling cruelty-free wares

Author: Hirsch, Corin

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When people hear the word "vegan," they may immediately think of meatless foods - portobello burgers, nut cheeses and soy products galore.
Yet not eating meat, eggs or dairy is only one facet of a vegan lifestyle - and the upcoming Long Island Vegan Extravaganza Winter Session at Huntington Station's Walt Whitman High School will offer a deep dive into vegan products and wellness, as well as plenty of vegan snacks.
CRUELTY-FREE SHOPPING
On Saturday, Feb. 10, over 50 exhibitors - from restaurants and bakeries to those that make apparel, art, jewelry and cosmetics - will gather inside the school's gymnasium to share food, products and information, with yoga classes and health presentations taking place in classrooms.
"Veganism is the way you live your life, and it's about health, the environment and animals. I wanted to bring those all together," says Christopher Muller, an organizer. Because vegans strive for a cruelty-free life by choosing food and products that do no harm, they may avoid leather and wool, and even makeup that's tested on animals. "Our vendors represent all aspects of that," he says.
Muller stopped eating meat eight years ago, he says, and then became vegan three years ago: "When I went vegan, I lost 50 pounds. It's just a healthier lifestyle."
This is the second Long Island Vegan Extravaganza session; the first, also at the high school, was an outgrowth of the group's organized meetups. "A couple of us were going to events and thought, why don't we have one on Long Island?" Muller said.
The August event attracted 600 people, double the number of people expected - a testament, perhaps, to swelling numbers of vegans (and the vegan-curious) on the Island.
SAMPLING OF VEGAN FARE
Among the food vendors at the upcoming event is Pleasant Petites, a raw and vegan wholesale bakery based in Amityville. Owner Bobby Nagelberg, also a co-organizer of the event, plans to sell lemon bars, peanut-butter brownies and his Ultimate Cocoa Krunch - "my version of a Kit Kat," says Nagelberg, who uses raw cacao powder and raw cacao butter in his products.
"I've always loved dessert-type foods, but as a vegan, I couldn't find any that weren't full of refined sugars. So I started messing around" with baked goods, Nagelberg says.
He began selling his products two years ago and found an audience: "As the vegan movement has grown, more and more people are aware of what they're putting into their bodies, and where the ingredients come from."
Other food and drink vendors include Coastal Craft Kombucha of Oceanside, Nautilus Roasting Co. - a coffee vendor based in Huntington - and Rocky Point's Beers Burgers Desserts, which will offer pitas filled with gyro-spiced falafel, dehydrated olives, vegan tzatziki and vegan cheese, cucumbers and a house-fermented hot sauce made from red jalapenos.

Full text: East Hampton's Turner Foster and Port Jefferson's Shane DeVincenzo know how important it is to make putts. Both are juniors who enjoyed successful sophomore seasons.
Only one stroke separated the super sophomores in the Suffolk championship. Foster won the Suffolk boys golf title when he defeated DeVincenzo on the first hole of a playoff. Both felt the difference came on the green where consistent putting proved crucial.
Both golfers qualified for the state championships, with DeVincenzo finishing sixth and Foster finishing 26th in a field of 99 golfers.
To help solidify their already strong skill sets, DeVincenzo and Foster both purchased new putters for the season.
"I can't wait to use my new putter in matches because it fits my eye perfect," Foster said. "I think it will lead to consistent lower scores."
Foster's father, Eden, is a golf professional at Maidstone Club in East Hampton and has significantly helped his son with his game, specifically improving his ball flight.
"I have played in many tournaments this summer and my dad and I have concluded that I need a consistent ball flight," Foster said. "I have been working on that lately and it seems to be helping."
DeVincenzo focused this summer on improving his bunker shots, and putting more consistently. In addition to the putter, he also added a new lob wedge to his bag.
"Both clubs are TaylorMade, which I like very much," DeVincenzo said. "They are very forgiving and I feel as though I am making a lot more putts with the new putter I have."
Sayville, which finished second at the county championships in 2016, will aim to make more putts as well.
Senior Sean Haselton and Brendan Smith are back for the Flashes, a year after finishing third and seventh, respectively, at the county tournament, and qualifying for the state championships.
Defending county champions, Northport, have aspirations of capturing a second consecutive county title. The Tigers have two key pieces returning in seniors Anthony Parziale and Spencer Ruthkowski.
In Nassau, there are a handful of teams that have aspirations of a county title.
Massapequa only lost one match in Conference IV last season and is off to a 2-0 start. Sophomore Tom Fasano shot 1-over 36 on the front nine on the Yellow Course at Bethpage during Massapequa's first match.
South Side and Oceanside are two teams to watch in Conference V. Senior Sean Griffen and junior Tim O'Brien both played on last season's South Side county qualifying team and are hoping for a repeat this year.
Oceanside coach Sean Keenan is excited about the multitude of young talent this season.
"We will start two eighth graders and three sophomores," Keenan said. "We should be very tough going forward."
Senior Charlie Mitchell will lead the way for Roslyn in Conference VI. Mitchell has been to the counties three straight years. Andrew Huang and Kevin Cheng are also up-and-coming juniors who have caught the eye of coach Bob Gerula.
A year after sharing the conference title with Roslyn, Locust Valley has opened its 2017 season with two impressive wins against Hicksville and Herricks.
Jon Kasday has been a member of the Falcons varsity team for the past five seasons and during the team's first match of the season he shot even-par 35 on the front nine at Engineers Country Club.
"We are hoping this can be the year to capture the conference title," Locust Valley coach Julie Feltman said. "Our goal for this season is to earn that title on our own."

2 Manhasset seniors win Stockholm Junior Water Prize

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two Manhasset High School seniors were honored in Sweden as winners of the grand prize in a prestigious international competition that explores water and environmental issues.
Rachel Chang and Ryan Thorpe took the top honor at the 2017 Stockholm Junior Water Prize, a weeklong contest open to students ages 15 to 20 who have conducted water-related projects of environmental, scientific, social or technological significance. It is administered by the Stockholm International Water Institute.
Chang and Thorpe, both 17, who represented the United States and vied against entrants from 32 other countries, were awarded $15,000 as well as $5,000 for their school by Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden. They also received $10,000 for winning first place at the national level during the summer in North Carolina.
The competition was held in conjunction with World Water Week in Stockholm, a global water conference.
"This is definitely a validation of the work we've been doing over the past two years," Chang said. "Water scarcity is such a huge issue."
The duo created a system to detect and purify bacteria-contaminated water through use of graphene biosensors. They worked on the project in a lab at their high school under the guidance of research teacher Alison Huenger.
To reach the international level, they first won at the regional, state and national levels - the latter of which, in June, included top projects from 48 states and Puerto Rico.
"Being able to interact with people from all over the world was a victory in itself," Thorpe said. "Each round was the prize for us."
EAST ROCKAWAY
Interim principal
Neil Lederer is the interim principal of East Rockaway Junior-Senior High School. He replaced Joseph Spero, who now is principal of a high school in Cortlandt, New York.
Lederer has held multiple interim superintendent and principal positions across Long Island since retiring from a seven-year stint as superintendent of the Lindenhurst school district in 2009. He began his administrative career as assistant principal of Lindenhurst Junior High School in 1976.
"I am thrilled to be joining the East Rockaway school district as its interim junior-senior high school principal," Lederer said. "I hope to build upon its fine programs so as to further enhance the academic experiences of our students."
LEVITTOWN
New principal
Daniel Keegan has been named principal of Island Trees Memorial Middle School.
Keegan, who replaced Roseann Cirnigliaro, most recently was an assistant principal at Oceanside Middle School; before that, he taught social studies for 17 years. He also has been a varsity basketball coach for the Oceanside school district.
"I am excited by the opportunity to lead Island Trees Memorial Middle School in so many areas, but I am most excited to help our students recognize the champions in themselves and in the teachers and staff who walk the halls with them each and every day," Keegan said.
SEAFORD
New superintendent
Adele Pecora has been appointed superintendent of the Seaford school district. She replaced Brian Conboy, who retired.
Pecora most recently served six years as assistant superintendent for curriculum, instruction and assessment K-12 for the Commack school district. She also has been director of curriculum, assessment and technology in Island Park, an assistant principal in Garden City and a social studies chairwoman in Massapequa.
"I look forward to working with the board and the entire Seaford community to foster intellectual curiosity and expand student opportunities by providing an exemplary education program for all Seaford students," Pecora said.

Superstorm Sandy babies: Checking in with two Long Island families

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As Long Island recently noted the fifth anniversary of superstorm Sandy, some families were marking a simultaneous milestone: the fifth birthday of their babies born during the storm.
"He's a terror. I say that because of the storm," jokes Yolanda Almonte, 34, about her son, Cecilio Jr., born at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Islip on Oct. 30, 2012.
Almonte says her memories of the birth have been especially vivid this year, because the family - which also includes twin siblings Lillyana and Christian, 7, and dad Cecilio, 35 - recently moved from Bay Shore to Kissimmee, Fla., and weathered yet another storm: "We just went through Hurricane Irma," Almonte says.
Margarita Udall, 34, of Oceanside, also gave birth on Oct. 30, 2012, to son Eli. She has a children's picture book she reads to him all the time called "On the Night You Were Born," by Nancy Tillman, which coincidentally is about a baby born during a tempest.
"He's still a little too young to fully understand what happened," says Eli's dad, James, 42. Eli, who just started kindergarten, loves sea creatures and dinosaurs, James says.
The Udalls have since experienced another birth: Eli's little sister, Isabelle, is 2. Her birth was quite uneventful compared to her big brother's. "It was during the day, it was sunny out, it wasn't raining," Margarita says.
After Eli's birth, the Udalls couldn't return immediately to their home, because their house had flooded. They had to live temporarily in Margarita's grandmother's one-bedroom apartment in Queens.
It was different with Isabelle. "I was able to bring her home afterwards, which was really great," Margarita says.

Lindenhurst's Jeremy Ruckert co-winner of 58th Hansen Award: Ohio State-bound standout excelled on offense, defense and as a kicker

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jeremy Ruckert wanted to leave a lasting impact on Lindenhurst's football program, and the four-year starter stamped his career by winning the Long Island Class I title as a senior.
In the Class I championship game against Oceanside, he was larger than life when the Bulldogs needed him most.
Ruckert made an acrobatic one-handed catch for a first down. He caught a touchdown pass. He caught a pass in triple coverage. He blocked. He kicked four extra points and two field goals. His kickoffs sailed out of the end zone.
As a defensive end/linebacker, he made tackles for a loss. He intercepted a pass. He blocked a field-goal try and returned it 61 yards to set up a score.
That not only was one game but a season-long story line, and Ruckert was named a co-winner of the 58th Carl A. Hansen Award, given to Suffolk's top football player, on Monday night at the Suffolk County Football Coaches Association dinner in Hauppauge. He shared the award with Westhampton's Dylan Laube.
Ruckert and his undefeated Bulldogs ran off a school-record 12 wins, capping a glorious season with a 40-23 victory over Oceanside at Stony Brook University.
"Could Jeremy do anything more to bring a title to Lindenhurst?" coach Nick Lombardo said. "This kid dominated every facet of the game. He willed us to the win."
Ruckert put on a clinic in his final game that left fans in awe. "He was a leader in every sense of the word," Lombardo said. "He could have cruised through his senior season with his Ohio State scholarship in hand. But he is a Lindy Bulldog through and through and he loves his hometown. All he talked about was winning an LIC."
The 6-6, 225-pounder did it all. He had 61 catches for 1,094 yards and 13 touchdowns against double- and triple-teams.
"I knew when we were faced with a third-and-long situation, Jeremy was going to make a big play," quarterback Nick Anzalone said. "I just needed to get the ball near him and it was his ball."
Ruckert gave Anzalone, a first-year starter, the confidence to throw into tight spots. "He's so athletic," Lombardo said. "He has the long reach, strength and he's also very tough to cover downfield."
On defense, Ruckert disrupted by coming off the edge. He scored six seconds into a regular-season game against Connetquot when he grabbed a batted pass and returned it for a touchdown. "It could have been the fastest touchdown in Long Island history," Lombardo said.
Ruckert made 61 tackles, including 13 sacks, and had the leg of an NFL kicker. He made 48 of 50 extra points and six field goals and had 42 touchbacks on kickoffs.
"Without this town, I wouldn't be where I am today, going to Ohio State. I love this town," Ruckert said. "My dad grew up here; I grew up here. I bleed green and white."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Tara Dunleavy took the stage as a Radio City Rockette in the "Christmas Spectacular" earlier this month, there was one tiny pair of eyes in particular that she was looking out for in the audience: those of her 11-month-old daughter, Ava.
Dunleavy, a first-time mom, has been a part of the 80-member precision dance team since 2006, after graduating from Hofstra University with a degree in dance.
Determined to reclaim her spot in the iconic kick line this holiday season, Dunleavy performed in the short-lived summer production, the "New York Spectacular," until she was five months pregnant. As soon as she got the OK from her doctor, six weeks after giving birth, she got back into rehearsal mode and resumed her pre-baby workout routine of yoga, spin and dance classes.
Come annual casting time, her preparation delivered. This year, she is one of just four moms in the legendary dance company.
"You never know how long you'll be able to do this for and to be able to now say that I can come back and share it with my daughter, is just kind of incredible," says Dunleavy, 35, of Oceanside.
A dancer since age 3, Dunleavy had long dreamed of being a Rockette after seeing the "Christmas Spectacular" as a young girl with her family. As she approached 18 - the age of eligibility to become a Rockette - Dunleavy feared it might be too tall an order.
"I'm 5-foot-6, so I didn't think I was tall enough," says Dunleavy, who is now in her 12th season. "So I was intimidated to go to the Rockette audition."
Rockettes must be between 5-6 and 5-10 1/2 and be proficient at ballet, tap and jazz.
TRAINING FOR THE TROUPE
Dunleavy tried out for a spot as an ensemble dancer in the "Christmas Spectacular" in college. She didn't get the job and instead finished her senior year at Hofstra. In 2006, she auditioned for a role as a Rockette and was cast on her first try.
For Long Island natives Eleni Gavalas and Kristen Smith, training alongside the Rockettes as teenagers helped them have a literal leg up on the competition years later.
Gavalas, who grew up in Manhasset, and Smith, who got her start as a dancer at age 3 at Tap to Pointe Dance Center in her hometown of Malverne, where she trained until she was 18, both took part in a Rockette summer intensive dance program at Radio City for three years in their teens.
"I would definitely say learning the technique and the style and getting to see a bit of the lifestyle of being a Rockette before I became one really helped me at the audition," says Smith, 24.
The one-week program - designed for advanced dancers - is entering its 16th season and has produced more than 70 Rockettes. It provides intensive training with the Rockettes and a director or choreographer from the production. It culminates in a showcase.
"My third year at the Rockettes summer intensive, I had also auditioned for the 'Christmas Spectacular,' and that was the same year that I got cast," says Gavalas, 24. She can still vividly recall looking out at her family in the audience. "That was really special, to have my parents there when I got offered the job."
Gavalas, Smith and Courtney Rottenberger, a Bethpage native, all tried out three times before being cast as Rockettes.
"I kept on coming back and it's been my dream come true," says Rottenberger, 32, a sixth-year Rockette.
PRACTICING AND PERFORMING
In the six weeks leading up to the launch of the "Christmas Spectacular," which runs through Jan. 1, the Rockettes practice six days a week for six hours a day. At the height of the holiday season, the Rockettes can perform in up to 17 shows a week and as many as four a day. The women average about 300 kicks per show. Since 1933, they have delivered such iconic numbers as the "Parade of the Wooden Soldiers," in which they don wooden soldier costumes and rigidly cascade to the floor. It's that kind of legacy that these Long Island women say keeps them kicking.
"Since I'm from Long Island, I was able to come to the city every year with my family and see the show and it's always such a special memory for us," Rottenberger says. "And now for me to be able to be part of other families' holiday traditions, is just really rewarding and special."

Hunter Sabety's 14 points, 15 rebounds lead Hofstra to big win: Transfer from Tufts fills in for injured center Rokas Gustys Justin Wright-Foreman leads way with 22 points

Author: Herrmann, Mark

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]03 Feb 2017.

Abstract: Filling in for injured center Rokas Gustys, Sabety - a transfer from Tufts who is listed at 6-9 and 290 pounds - had 14 points, 15 rebounds and enough strength to lift a team that needed a victory desperately. The Pride made seven of its first eight shots, boosted by a solid game by Eli Pemberton (10 of his 12 points in the second half) despite a swollen ankle. Sabety, who had a 48-point game...

Full text: The difference for Hofstra from the first half to the second was night and day, rags to riches, low to high. Choose any description.
Coach Joe Mihalich worked on the latter theme, saying, "We had to look up to see a snake's belly at halftime. But we responded."
The entire Pride team raised its game to turn an 11-point halftime deficit into a 73-65 win over Delaware at Mack Sports Complex on Thursday night. No one did it more than Hunter Sabety of Oceanside, who has gone from Division III to Division I and had the college game of his life.
Filling in for injured center Rokas Gustys, Sabety - a transfer from Tufts who is listed at 6-9 and 290 pounds - had 14 points, 15 rebounds and enough strength to lift a team that needed a victory desperately.
"Hunter was big tonight," said Justin Wright-Foreman, who led the team with 22 points, his eighth game of at least 20 this season. "He just stepped up to the plate. We just fed off him because he brought the energy to the game."
It was the second game in a row that Gustys missed, which put Sabety in an unaccustomed leading role. He was ready.
"Me and Rok battle each other in practice every day, so I knew whenever I had the opportunity, I was going to be able to step up to the plate," said the squad's only Long Islander. "But everybody really did. The first half was pretty slow, but at halftime in the locker room, we really spoke to each other, really trying to get in each other's head, saying it's now or never."
Hofstra (11-13, 3-8 in the CAA) was coming off two losses and was in a three-way tie with Delaware and Drexel for last place in the conference. In the first 20 minutes, its defense was porous and its offense was poor (29.6 percent). Wright-Foreman said that at halftime, "Chairs were flying."
Performance spoke loudest after intermission. The Pride made seven of its first eight shots, boosted by a solid game by Eli Pemberton (10 of his 12 points in the second half) despite a swollen ankle.
No one, though, stood out more than Sabety, who earned his degree in December and will take graduate business courses the rest of this season and next. Sabety, who had a 48-point game against Massapequa and six triple-doubles during his senior year at Oceanside, augmented his first college double-double with three blocks and three steals.
He liked Tufts, but this is a different level. "I was playing some summer ball around here and I started talking to the coaches," he said. "The opportunity arose and I took it. I took a swing. I always wanted to see what it was like to play D-I basketball. I love the coaching staff, I love the team, I love playing with the guys. I love being here now."
On Thursday night, he took another swing and hit one out of the park.

Feds arrest 10 alleged members of Bonanno crime family

Author: DeStefano, Anthony M

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]29 Mar 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1881676044?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Federal agents early Tuesday rounded up 10 reputed members and associates of the Bonanno crime family, including one from Long Island, on racketeering conspiracy charges in the latest effort by investigators to mop up the mob group and grab its assets, officials said.
Among those arrested were Ronald Giallanzo, the nephew of Bonanno crime family captain Vincent Asaro, 82, and allegedly an acting captain in the crime family.
Asaro was acquitted in November 2015 of charges related to the infamous nearly $6 million Lufthansa heist at Kennedy Airport in 1978, but he was arrested last week on a separate federal arson charge.
Also charged in the federal indictment Tuesday were Nicholas "Pudgie" Festa, 36, of Oceanside, and Howard Beach residents Michael Palmaccio, 45, and Michael Padavona, 48. All three were identified in court papers as soldiers in the crime family.
The charges in the indictment included 30 acts of racketeering, including one count of attempted murder in 2006, as well as numerous loan-sharking and illegal gambling charges. It also included allegations of arson, narcotics and robbery conspiracy.
The attempted murder charge involves a crime family dispute with a drug dealer identified as "John Doe # 5" who was shot and wounded in 2006.
One of the defendants, Robert Tanico, 49, of Queens, was accused of lying during his federal grand jury testimony. He will be arraigned Wednesday. The indictment also charged a total of 37 separate counts of overt acts.
The charges show that La Cosa Nostra is still present in the community, acting Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde said in a statement.
Giallanzo, 46, a man with a significant criminal record, is depicted in the indictment and a government detention letter as a major player in the Bonanno family. The warrant for Giallanzo's arrest was based on him violating his supervised release in a different case.
He has been a member of the crime family for almost 20 years and has held the rank of acting captain since 2014, court papers stated.
Giallanzo is alleged to have had over $3 million in loan shark money out on the street and allegedly used Festa to manage some of his portfolio of loans, which pulled in $10,000 a week in interest, according to court papers.
Although Giallanzo reported little income, his loan-sharking and gambling operations pumped out enough money that he was able to spend millions to purchase and design a "gargantuan" house on 86th Street, court papers stated. Prosecutors said the huge house was a reminder to his Howard Beach neighbors of Giallanzo's wealth and power.
If Giallanzo is convicted, prosecutors said in the indictment that they will try to seize his home. Court records show they also want to seize the home of Festa in Oceanside and the Howard Beach properties of Padovona and Palmaccio, court records show.
Giallanzo was ordered held without bail by a magistrate, while Festa, Palmaccio and Padavona were ordered held without bail at their arraignments Tuesday in Brooklyn federal district court.

Court to begin case of Marine's discharge over unsecure email: Major Jason Brezler sent a classified document He says it was an attempt to save fellow Marines' lives

Author: Kessler, Robert E

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]14 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828456657?accountid=37869

Abstract: The 2013 decision of a Marine board of inquiry to expel Brezler from the Marine Corps reserves, albeit with an honorable discharge, is on hold pending the outcome of the case before U.S. District Judge Joseph Bianco in Central Islip.

Full text:   A major in the Marine Corps is scheduled Friday in federal court to fight an attempt to boot him from the service because he sent a classified document over his personal Yahoo account in an effort, he says, to save the lives of fellow Marines.
Major Jason Brezler says he sent the classified document, about an allegedly corrupt Afghan police chief, on the unsecured account that was available. However, if his email had been acted upon, it might have prevented the killing of three Marines in Afghanistan in 2012, including that of Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. of Oceanside, according to court papers and his attorneys.
The 2013 decision of a Marine board of inquiry to expel Brezler from the Marine Corps reserves, albeit with an honorable discharge, is on hold pending the outcome of the case before U.S. District Judge Joseph Bianco in Central Islip. Brezler, of Brooklyn, is a FDNY firefighter who graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and has served four tours of duty in Afghanistan.
Brezler and his attorneys have maintained that an initial investigation determined that he should get no punishment. But when Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford), who represents Buckley's area, began asking the Marines why the inquiry board had been convened, Brezler's expulsion was ordered. This is an attempt to cover up a Marine commander's failure to act on the confidential report, they say.
King, in an interview earlier this week, called Brezler's treatment "a travesty of justice."
"Here you have Marines killed, and the only one who did the right thing - he's being punished," King said.
Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District, which is defending the Marine Corps and the Navy in the case, declined to comment. Though the case is being heard in the Eastern District on Long Island, Southern District prosecutors are defending the government to avoid a conflict of interest because the Eastern District has a separate criminal investigation into the deaths of the three Marines.
Government attorneys say in court papers that Brezler received a fair hearing, and the decision was reviewed and approved by Marine and Navy officials. Government attorneys also noted it is highly unusual for federal courts to intercede in military decisions.
But Brezler's attorneys, Michael Bowe and Kevin Carroll, have said that the Brezler hearing was filled with procedural errors and the retaliatory motive behind it was clear, so civilian federal courts should intercede in this instance.
The classified email Brezler sent involved the background of an Afghan police officer named Sarwar Jan. Brezler had been instrumental in 2010 in expelling Jan from a Marine base when he was in Afghanistan because of his corruption and his keeping young boys as sex slaves, the court papers said.
When Brezler left Afghanistan to attend graduate classes in Oklahoma in 2012, a fellow officer emailed him to say that Jan had returned to work at a Marine base and asked Brezler if he had any information on Jan. The confidential file on Sarwar Jan was what Brezler emailed back. Several weeks later a 15-year-old boy who accompanied the police chief to the base took a rifle and shot Buckley and the two other Marines to death, according to court files and defense attorneys.
Brezler's attorney Bowe only would say earlier in the week: "We have presented compelling evidence and are looking forward to having the court pass on the propriety of the Marine Corps actions."
The family of Buckley, the Oceanside Marine, has filed a separate civil suit in the Eastern District asking the courts to order the Marines to turn over all records of the case, which they say they are entitled to as relatives of a deceased service member. That case is pending.
George Buckley Sr., the father of the dead Marine, could not immediately be reached for comment.

Ryan Hilke hits OT game-winner for Calhoun versus Massapequa: Calhoun stuns Massapequa in Nassau Class AA championships

Author: Kramer, Ari

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]03 Nov 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835763920?accountid=37869

Abstract: Hilke had scored just one goal in the regular season.

Full text:   Ryan Hilke is earning quite a reputation for himself.
For the second time this postseason, the Calhoun sophomore netted an overtime winner. The first one defeated No. 6 Oceanside in the quarterfinals. The second, on an unseasonably warm Wednesday evening at Hofstra, carried a bit more weight.
Hilke's goal 51 seconds into overtime upset No. 1 Massapequa, giving No. 3 Calhoun a 1-0 win in the Nassau Class AA championship. In the 14 seasons since Calhoun last won a county title in 2001, Massapequa had won or shared nine championships.
"That was unbelievable," senior captain Joe Thomann said. "That kid is always in the right place at the right time. I just saw it bouncing around right to him, and he tapped it in. He did it in the Oceanside game, and it was amazing to see again. It was awesome."
Hilke had scored just one goal in the regular season. His only goals in the postseason have been overtime winners. The one that sent the Colts into Sunday's Long Island championship - where they will face either Brentwood or Newfield - came off a scramble in the box.
Nealson Gil sent a long free kick into the box. Massapequa could not clear the ball, and Thomann headed it from the right post toward the center of the 6-yard box. Eric Stewart's one-touch shot ricocheted off Massapequa's Steven Mahan (five saves) and onto Hilke's foot by the left post.
All Hilke needed to do was tap it in. After he did, he ripped off his jersey and sprinted to the southeast corner of the field to celebrate in front of the parking lot instead of the opposite side where Calhoun's fans were jumping and screaming.
"No," Hilke said when asked if he knew where he was running. "It was just a lot of emotion at the time."
If not for spectacular defensive play by Massapequa (12-5-1), Hilke would not have needed to answer that question. The Colts (12-2) created several chances near the middle of the second half but could not capitalize.
In the 54th minute, Calhoun's Michael Harten sent a free kick into the box. Mahan came out of goal but could only bat the ball away. An ensuing header was on trajectory for the open net, but Tyler Hutchinson rose as the last line of defense and headed the ball into space.
Jake Bresnihan made a nearly identical play eight minutes later, and Mahan dove to save Alex Sipos' shot to the left corner in the 66th minute.
But despite Massapequa's effort, the Colts persevered. They were rewarded early in overtime, thanks to a sophomore with a burgeoning reputation.
Said Stewart, " always comes up big in overtime in the right place, right time."

Couple says UPS delivered assault rifle, not toy for grandchild

Author: Yan, Ellen

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 Dec 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1849136282?accountid=37869

Abstract: Cradled in foam was a semi-automatic rifle with a sophisticated scope, a stand, an ammo clip and a copy of an Arizona man's driver's license and his concealed-weapons permit, Berman said.

Full text:   An Oceanside couple expecting a United Parcel Service delivery of a toy plane instead got a surprise - a package containing an assault rifle.
Joel Berman said he opened the keyboard-sized case Wednesday night in front of his wife and 6-year-old granddaughter, wondering how it could be the Kohl's toy.
"Her mouth popped open," said Berman, 66. "It definitely was not a toy gun. . . . We had to explain to her Santa delivered the wrong thing."
Cradled in foam was a semi-automatic rifle with a sophisticated scope, a stand, an ammo clip and a copy of an Arizona man's driver's license and his concealed-weapons permit, Berman said.
The UPS label, which had Kohl's in Ohio as the sender, had been pasted over another UPS label from the Arizona resident to a gunsmith in upstate Woodbourne.
"I have a receipt from the UPS driver showing . . . 3.4 pounds as the weight of the package, but it was 51 pounds," Joel Berman, a trade-magazine publisher, said. "It's funny, but at the same time, it's sad.
"This could have been delivered to a home that had either someone with ill intentions who would have loved to have something like this. Or it could have been delivered to a home with kids."
They shuffled their granddaughter to another room and she immediately hugged her new puppy, Berman said.
The couple called 911 - the operator told him "Oh my God" - and three patrol cars arrived within minutes.
Nassau police said they will get the rifle to the upstate gunsmith.
A UPS spokesman said late last night he did not know about the incident and could not immediately get details but would look into it.
The UPS driver had arrived with the case Wednesday just as Berman's wife Anna was about drive off to pick up her granddaughter, the couple said. So she asked the driver to put the package into her car, and for the next several hours as she did errands and chauffeured her granddaughter, an assault weapon was sitting in the car, the couple said in looking back nervously.
Police took the rifle, filed a UPS claim for the couple, and Thursday, the right package somehow arrived from the "overgoods" department.
The plane is for their friend's son.
Berman can't figure out how a 51-pound package passed for a 3.4-pound one and UPS didn't notice.
"Sometimes in our holiday season," Berman said, "things aren't as well covered as they should be."

Vietnam veterans from LI honored - 50 years later

Author: Ruud, Candice

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]06 Mar 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770588944?accountid=37869

Abstract: Republican state Sen. Jack Martins of Old Westbury presented medals to the veterans with Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) and Col. Thomas Owens, commander of the 106th Rescue Wing of the Air National Guard in Westhampton Beach.

Full text:   For Hugh Reyes, the emotional release was a very long time coming.
As he stood outside the Cradle of Aviation Museum on Saturday, clutching a black handkerchief, the tears wouldn't stop coming.
"It feels good," he said. "I feel really good."
Reyes, 72, of Uniondale, was among 39 Vietnam veterans honored for their service - a recognition by all accounts that was decades overdue.
The ceremony, marking the more than 50 years that have passed since the war began, was organized by the Long Island Air Force Association and held in the sun-streaked atrium of the Garden City museum. Scores of the veterans' family members and friends attended, many dabbing away tears of their own.
"The veterans gathered here today came home . . . and were often scorned for their service to their country," retired Air National Guard Col. Bill Stratemeier told the audience.
Republican state Sen. Jack Martins of Old Westbury presented medals to the veterans with Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) and Col. Thomas Owens, commander of the 106th Rescue Wing of the Air National Guard in Westhampton Beach.
"We as a country missed an opportunity 50 years ago, and here we are 50 years later taking the opportunity to say, 'Thank you, God bless you,' and to welcome you home with open arms and recognize the sacrifices you made and the sacrifices your families made," Martins said. "It's long overdue."
Reyes, who served in Vietnam and earned the Combat Infantry Badge, said thoughts of fellow Army soldiers who died in the jungles and the anti-war resentment he encountered back in America still haunt him.
"I'm honored to have fought for my country and to come home alive and with all my limbs," Reyes said after the ceremony. "I'm blessed."
"I was hurt, the way we were treated when we came home," he said. "My unit, the first four months I was in Vietnam, 80 percent of my company got wiped out."
"My wounds are up here," he added, pointing to his head.
Alfred Bosco, 69, a decorated Vietnam combat veteran, said he is still nursing emotional wounds.
But he likes how veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan today are hailed as heroes, and is grateful that the thank-yous for his generation's service and sacrifice are finally being said.
"It took a long time, a lot of healing," said Bosco, who lives in Oceanside. "Fifty years. It's about time."

Todd Kaminsky, Christopher McGrath tout endorsements: Rep. Kathleen Rice says Kaminsky would 'clean up Albany' Rep. Peter King says McGrath would make sure LI 'gets its fair share'

Author: Brodsky, Robert

Abstract: Democrat Todd Kaminsky and Republican Christopher McGrath, who will face off in an April 19 special election to fill the seat of former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, each touted endorsements on Monday from Long Island members of Congress.

Full text:   Democrat Todd Kaminsky and Republican Christopher McGrath, who will face off in an April 19 special election to fill the seat of former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, each touted endorsements on Monday from Long Island members of Congress.
Kaminsky, a state assemblyman from Long Beach, was endorsed at his Oceanside campaign office by Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City).
McGrath, an attorney from Hewlett, was endorsed by Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) in a news release.
Kaminsky and McGrath are vying for the 9th Senate District seat, which was vacated in December when Skelos was convicted on eight counts of bribery, extortion and conspiracy charges. He and his son, Adam, who also was convicted in the case, are appealing.
Rice said Kaminsky, a former federal prosecutor, would "clean up Albany and restore New Yorkers' faith and trust in their state government. Todd is a true public servant who grew up here in Nassau County and knows the issues that matter most to our communities, from helping superstorm Sandy victims rebuild to holding the line on taxes for middle-class families."
Rice's 4th Congressional District includes much of the 9th Senate District.
King, whose district includes parts of Nassau and Suffolk counties, said McGrath would help ensure that Long Island schools are not shortchanged.
"Let's send Chris to Albany to fight for all of us and make sure Long Island gets its fair share," King said. "Chris will fight to keep our taxes low, and make sure the New York City politicians don't try to take money from our Long Island schools."
McGrath's campaign on Monday also criticized Kaminsky for voting in June 2015 to extend Nassau County's hotel-motel tax. Kaminsky said in a recent TV ad that he voted "110 times" against tax increases that would have affected municipalities across the state.
"Typical politician Todd Kaminsky is a hypocrite," said Marcus Povinelli, a McGrath spokesman. "He says he voted against taxes, but when it matters the most, he votes yes to allow Nassau County to continue to impose additional taxes."
The county imposes a 3 percent tax on occupancy at all hotels and motels in Nassau. That money is used to fund community events in county parks.
Kaminsky's campaign said the extension of Nassau's hotel tax was not controversial and passed the Senate 59-2, with the support of all members of Long Island's Republican Senate delegation.
"When you have no plan to clean up Albany, no plan to lower taxes and don't even think what Dean Skelos did was wrong, you find a new, creative way to grasp at straws," said Kaminsky spokesman Evan Thies.
Laurence Hirsh, an accountant from Valley Stream, is also running for the seat on the Green party line.

Readers honor their gardening dads for good food, memories

Abstract: [...]Wolkoff is such a presence on the Long Island dahlia scene that the Dahlia Garden at Bayard Cutting Arboretum is named after him.

Full text:   With the arrival of Father's Day, what better way to honor all the gardening dads out there than with a nod to their efforts and the positive impact they've had on their families? From hauling and digging to planting and pruning, these dads not only work hard, they've made lasting memories for their loved ones.
My own father, Anthony Pace, grew roses (and romantically clipped bouquets for my mom every weekend during the growing season). He grew figs and planted grapevines in our Queens backyard, too, and tended never-ending crops of juicy tomatoes, hot peppers, eggplants, zucchini, herbs and - my favorite - cucuzza squash that grew taller than me. He also instilled in me an interest, which grew into a love, in watching things grow. These readers' families have similar stories to tell:
William J. Wolkoff Sr., 93, Brightwaters
"My dad, William J. Wolkoff, is a World War II veteran, a member of the Long Island Dahlia Society, Mid-Island Dahlia Society, the Horticultural Society and a master gardener," writes Phyllis Wolkoff.
In fact, Wolkoff is such a presence on the Long Island dahlia scene that the Dahlia Garden at Bayard Cutting Arboretum is named after him. He is also active with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County in Riverhead, and he received an award in September from the American Dahlia Society.
Philip Grombliniak, 58, Levittown
"My dad's tomatoes are a tradition in our family," says Dara Marciano. "Our family gathers each Sunday for Sunday sauce made with his delicious tomatoes. We eat and laugh for hours. This summer is especially special because my daughter was born last month. My dad, a custodian, is now a grandfather, and the tradition of dad's Sunday sauce using his homegrown tomatoes is being passed to the next generation. We also enjoy his zucchini, cucumbers and basil."
Mitchell Ribera, 34, Oceanside
"My husband loves our garden!" says Lauren Ribera. "When we moved into our home a little over four years ago, the backyard was a mess. Overgrown shrubs, dead trees and ivy as far as the eye could see. Mitchell, however, saw past all that. As he cleared the yard, he uncovered old car batteries, a propane tank, lawn cushions and even a surfboard! More importantly, as the yard seemed to grow bigger, so did his passion for gardening. You name it, he grows it - typical home garden fare like beans, tomatoes, lettuce, kale, carrots, broccoli, peppers, squash, zucchini, potatoes, asparagus and pumpkins, as well as veggies I had never heard of like nasturtium and Jerusalem artichokes. The fruit plants include strawberries, grapes, blueberries, currants, Goji berries and watermelon. Fruit trees are abundant, too - Mitchell grows cherry, plum, peach, apple and fig.
"It's not always easy for Mitchell to find time to garden with our busy family, which includes 4 1/2-year-old twins, Natalie and Julia, and James, 2, plus baby No. 4 arriving this fall. The easiest way to find time is to include the children in the garden, and oh how they love it! They eat things I never would have touched as a kid, and the credit goes to Mitchell.
"He has expanded far more than their palates in the garden: Our children delight in watching the plants blossom and grow. They have learned about root systems and the responsibility of caring for living things. They think nothing of picking a snack while they are outside playing or picking vegetables for dinner. As a family, we have made our own tomato sauce, pickles and grape juice.
"What began as my husband's interest in gardening has become a fun-filled activity in which the whole family can participate!"

LI Children's Museum's fairy tale exhibit for young readers: Kids test senses with a "Beauty and the Beast" activity Chinese, French versions explored

Author: Whitehouse, Beth

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]18 Nov 2015.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1733600781?accountid=37869

Abstract: The gallery looks at seven fairy tales: "Beauty and the Beast," the Chinese fairy tale "Lon Po Po" - meaning "Granny Wolf" - the African spider story "Anansi and the Talking Melon," "Jack and the Beanstalk," "Cinderella," "Thumbelina" and "The Elves and the Shoemaker.

Full text:   Jessie Celestin, 8, a third-grader in the Oceanside School District, stuck her hand through a cloth barrier and into a box at the Long Island Children's Museum.
"It feels like a glove," she says.
Good guess, but it's wrong. It's velvet.
"This one is easy! I think it's a bracelet," she says, sticking her hand in a second box.
Close enough - it's a beaded necklace.
The guessing game is part of the museum's current traveling exhibit, "Once Upon a Time: Exploring the World of Fairy Tales," which will be at the museum through Jan. 3, 2016, and is included with museum admission.
During a school field trip, Jessie is trying to reach in and determine the gifts that Belle received from the Beast in the fairy tale "Beauty and the Beast."
The gallery looks at seven fairy tales: "Beauty and the Beast," the Chinese fairy tale "Lon Po Po" - meaning "Granny Wolf" - the African spider story "Anansi and the Talking Melon," "Jack and the Beanstalk," "Cinderella," "Thumbelina" and "The Elves and the Shoemaker."
"Fairy tales are the quintessential storytelling format for children," says Erik Schurink, museum director of exhibits. And one of the goals of the gallery is to promote literacy.
Even parents may learn something they didn't already know - for instance, that the story of Cinderella has more than 1,500 versions, with Cinderella being named Yeh-hsien in a Chinese version and Cendrillon in a French telling.
Other interactive elements of the gallery let kids hammer nails into the soles of shoes as part of "The Elves and the Shoemaker" story, hoist a wolf in a basket up a tree as part of "Lon Po Po," don a dress to ride in a pumpkin coach like Cinderella, and more.
"You really do step into the stories," says Maureen Mangan, museum director of communications. "If you can inspire a child to want to read, they'll read for the rest of their lives."
Kids also have a chance to "write" their own fairy tale at the exhibit, by filling in the blanks in a computer template they can print out to take home.
Priscilla Abadia, 8, a classmate of Jessie's, chooses a troll as her main character "because it looks funny," she says. He falls in a "river" and is rescued by a "woodsman" who uses a "fishing pole" to yank him out. - Beth Whitehouse

Mosquito samples test
positive for West Nile
With a mosquito sample collected July 21 at Blydenburgh County Park in Smithtown testing positive for West Nile virus, officials have advised suspending park activities from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m., the Suffolk County health department said yesterday.
The parks commissioner has been notified, officials said in a release.
Six other mosquito samples, all Culex pipiens/restuans, also tested positive. The samples were collected July 21 and 22 in West Islip, East Northport, Lindenhurst, West Babylon and Copiague. That brings to 19 the total number of mosquito samples for the year in Suffolk, along with three birds.
Nassau County reported three positive mosquito samples this year, a spokeswoman said.

Husband, wife get prison
for evading $350G in taxes
Dr. Jeffrey S. Stein, a vascular surgeon who practiced in Manhattan and at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, was sentenced yesterday to 18 months in prison for tax cheating.
His wife, personal-injury lawyer Marla Stein, was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.
Together, the duo pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to evading $350,000 in taxes by claiming phony professional expenses and then creating false documentation to thwart an IRS audit.
Jeffrey Stein, 58, and Marla Stein, 52, live in Manhattan. U.S. District Judge Denise Cote agreed to stagger their sentences so one will be able to care for the couple's teenage children while the other is serving time.

Murray also won the 200 free (1:47.23) and 500 free (4:51.01) both in state-qualying times. Youssef Ibrahim won the 1-meter diving event (291.22) for Bellmore-Merrick.

Full text: Newsday is opening this story to all readers as we provide Long Islanders with news and information you can use during the coronavirus outbreak. All readers can learn the latest news at newsday.com/LiveUpdates
Facing the challenge of keeping children entertained while at home, Long Islanders have turned to free nightly story times - and some are even hosting their own.
Bethpage elementary school teachers and parents have created a rotating weeknight bedtime story effort, featuring readings of children's books on live video.
"They're cute little stories - it's just nice," says Kramer Elementary School PTA president, Michele Devine of Bethpage. "They're relaxing, they're not talking about coronavirus." Books that have been read so far include "Waiting Is Not Easy!" by Mo Willems and Dr. Seuss' "If I Ran the Rain Forest" and "One fish two fish red fish blue fish," among others.
Devine explains the bedtime story effort is meant to temporarily replace the PTA's Pick A Reading Partner program that was in effect prior to the schools' shutdown - a national literacy effort that encourages people to read together and involves parents and grandparents reading to classes in person. Since they're not in school, the effort has moved to Facebook.
GETTING INTO CHARACTER
She adds that instead of having their own parent read to them, "it's nice to see other parents or someone special since they're cooped up" with their own parents these days, and she notes that "some of the readers really get into it" and almost do acting jobs while reading the dialogue of characters in the books.
One of the "readers" who takes his bedtime story job quite seriously with accents and all is Mike Corcoran, a physical education teacher at Seaford Harbor Elementary School. He read "Pirate Pete" by Kim Kennedy. He has four daughters: Sarah, 25, Katie, 10, Allie, 8 and Maggie, 6, and says all his girls loved him reading the book to them, so he's had a lot of practice.
"I think it's a great idea," he says of the new effort. "You can promote reading with kids and bring the community together - we want to do anything we can to bring the community together in a time like this."
Devine's daughter, Katie, says the bedtime stories help because, "I miss my friends, my school and my teachers."
The Bethpage parents' bedtime videos are posted at about 7 p.m. on the PTA's Facebook page.
BOOKS WITH A MESSAGE
On her own public Facebook page, Roslyne Johnson, a social worker at Oceanside High School, is sharing uplifting story-time videos, too. "Storytime with Mrs. J." happens from 7 to 7:30 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. Johnson reads two story books to viewers, typically one featuring an African American character and the other with a social theme. The half-hour of reading is as much for the moms as for the children.
"These moms need a break," Johnson says, and she hopes this will give them a chance to sit down after dinner with a cup of tea while their children watch.
Johnson, 54, who lives in Hempstead, is choosing books that she owns from when her three children were growing up - her youngest is now in college, the oldest is 35. To illustrate her Facebook page where visitors see the story time, she chose a photo of an African American woman blowing the dust off the pages of a book.
"It's definitely geared toward the African-American children because it's important for children to see characters who look like them," Johnson says of the story time.
Reading choices so far have included "We're Going on a Lion Hunt" by David Axtell, "Leola and the Honeybears" by Melodye Benson Rosales and "Armadillo Tattletale" by Helen Ketterman.
"My granddaughter is 3 years old. She was glued to my phone," says Nichelle N. Rivers, 48, of East Islip, director of grants for the Roosevelt School District.
Johnson says she is organically growing a group of young viewers. "I asked parents to send me names of their children so I can use their names to greet them and to connect with them," she says. "The children like to hear their names being said."
Attend "Storytime with Mrs. J" at Facebook.com/Roslynedjohnson.

Satisfy your cravings with orders from LI's best artisanal pizzerias

Author: Marcus, Erica

Abstract: None available.

Full text: These days, we're all giving our local pizzerias a workout. But if you're looking for a special treat and are inclined to take a drive, here are some of Long Island's best artisanal pizzerias. By "artisanal" I mean establishments whose ovens are often fueled by wood or coal, whose toothsome crusts are the result of a long, cold fermentation process and whose toppings - fresh mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes, imported prosciutto - tend toward the luxe. It's true these pies are best straight out of the oven. But there's nothing stopping you from eating them in the car. (Otherwise, a few minutes in a 450-degree oven can restore their crisp bottoms and gooey tops.)
Like everything right now, pizzerias are in flux. Some are working through their traditional days off, some are taking extra days to restock. Call first.
Centro Cucina (43 Glen Cove Rd., Greenvale): This modest little trattoria does pretty much everything well and Centro Cucina's pizza is no exception. The prosciutto pie, topped with an abundance of prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and shaved Parmesan, is my pick, although a customer favorite is the white pie (not on the menu), laden with mozzarella, ricotta and truffle oil. More info: 516-484-3880, centrocucinacafe.com
Donatina Pizza Cafe (18 West Ave., Patchogue): They're doing it all at Donatina, John Peragine's new Patchogue pizzeria. In addition to a Neapolitan wood-burning oven, he has a wall of deck ovens for both traditional New York- and Detroit-style pies. (The latter is, essentially, a Sicilian beneath whose toppings is a crust of melted and browned brick and mozzarella cheeses.) Don't miss the open-faced calzone, whose torpedo shape maximizes the proportion of well-browned crust. It arrives heaving with a molten filling of fresh mozzarella, ricotta, sausage and marinara sauce. More info: 631-730-7002, donatinapizza.com
Grimaldi's Pizzeria (980 Franklin Ave., Garden City): When Frank Ciolli bought Grimaldi's coal-fired pizzeria in Brooklyn in 2001, a dynasty was born. Ciolli and his partners have gone on to open Grimaldi's all over the country, but the one in Garden City, opened by Ciolli's late son Russell, was the first East Coast location opened outside of New York City. As befits its parentage, the Margherita pizza here is classic New York, almost lavishly topped with chopped tomato and fresh mozzarella. More info: 516-294-6565, grimaldisgardencity.com
The Gristmill (144 Main St., East Rockaway): The Gristmill's co-owner and pizzaiolo Jerry Miele has solved the age-old problem of choosing between pizza and calzone with this nifty hybrid, dubbed "the combo." The calzone "handle," filled with ricotta, mozzarella, pecorino and a little roasted red pepper oil, is the perfect counterpoint to his elegant, Neapolitan pie, dotted with coins of piquant pepperoni. Miele and partner John Orphanos opened their casual "brick oven bistro" last year and immediately vaulted into the top echelon of LI pizzerias. New this year is a liquor license, so you can sit at the bar and unwind while Miele plies his trade. More info: 516-792-6104, thegristmillbob.com
King Umberto's (1343 Hempstead Tpke., Elmont): John Cesarano grew up at King Umberto, the iconic Elmont pizzeria established by his father, Ciro Cesarano, and partner Rosario Fuschetto. But young Cesarano (nom de pizza: "Giovanni Chez") was determined to create something on his own and, last year, he settled on a variation of Roman-style pizza that is baked not in a pan but directly on the floor of the oven. His "metro" pie is a puffy, crusty pizza that's about 10 inches wide and 3 feet long (metro is Italian for "meter"). The metro is all about the crust, chewy yet filled with pockets of air, the result of a long, slow fermentation and gentle handling. More info: 516-352-8391, kingumberto.com
La Margherita (1231 Station Rd., Medford): When he opened La Margherita on a bucolic stretch of road in 1991, Giuseppe Illiano recalled that neither the Town of Brookhaven Building Division nor the Suffolk Department of Health had ever seen a restaurant with a wood-burning pizza oven. But he was a proud son of Naples and was determined to make proper pizza Napoletana in his second restaurant. (The first, Tony's, had opened in Medford a decade earlier.) La Margherita also makes traditional American-style pies in a deck oven, but it's the 12-inch pizzas, crafted with housemade mozzarella and canned Italian tomatoes that are closest to Illiano's heart. More Info: 631-924-0048, lamargheritapizza.com
La Pala (246 Glen St., Glen Cove): When New Yorkers travel to Naples, they invariably find fault with the pizza there: the crust is too floppy and soft, they say, the topping is too soupy. But La Pala in Glen Cove makes pizza the way it's made in Naples. The crust is puffy and light, the mozzarella and tomatoes meld beautifully - if a bit soupily. Go ahead, eat it with a knife and fork. La Pala takes its name from the paddle used to get pizza in and out of the oven. You can see a lovely old pala hanging next to the wood-burning oven. More info: 516-399-2255, lapalany.com
Naples Street Food (Franklin Square and Oceanside): Naples Street Food's pie is unapologetically Neapolitan. It is bordered by a puffy rim ("cornicione" in Italian) whose texture - pillowy but chewy - is the result of a long, cold fermentation and superfine "tipo 00" flour. Since 2016, when he opened his tiny pizzeria in Franklin Square, Naples-born pizzaiolo Gianluca Chiarolanza has tightened up his pies, making the crust crisper and the toppings less soupy than is traditional in Italy. The original Naples Street Food has a wood-burning oven imported from Italy and, as of December, a macaroni menu overseen by pasta savant Gigi Sachetti, formerly of Da Gigi in Lynbrook. The the new Oceanside location, which opened last year, uses an Italian-made electric oven that mimics and possibly (dare I say) improves upon its wood-burning cousin. More info: 970 Hempstead Tpke., Franklin Square, 516-673-4630, naplesstreetfoodmenu.com; 2905 Long Beach Rd., Oceanside; 516-442-1692
Pazzo (6278 Route 25A, Wading River): Dean Sackos is a recent convert to the cult of wood. The Lake Ronkonkoma native started working the gas-fired deck oven (standard equipment at Long Island pizzerias) across the street at Cara Mia when he was 14. Two years later, he bought the pizzeria and ran it for the next 16 years. When he teamed up with Pazzo's owner, Maria Tranchina, in 2017 the two decided to install a wood-burning oven right next to the deck ovens, and Sackos enrolled in a course to learn how to use it. He was smitten at once. "Pazzo" means crazy, and the toppings there do not disappoint. Pies are topped with braised short ribs and portobellos in a Cognac cream sauce; rosemary-fig jam with Gorgonzola, Fontina and prosciutto; spinach, artichokes and bacon in a cream sauce. This is also the rare wood-burning pizzeria that makes vegan pies with dairy-free cheese. More info: 631-929-3939, pazzorestaurantwadingriver.com
The Pie at Salvatore's (120 E. Main St., Bay Shore): When Fred Lacagnia opened this Bay Shore pizzeria, it was a collaboration between the original Port Washington location and The Pie, another coal-oven operation in Port Jefferson. But by the end of the first year, the Port Jefferson restaurant relinquished its partnership and, in 2017, Lacagnina sold the Port Washington store. More information: 631-206-1060, salvatorescoalfiredpizza.com
Pizza Rita (55 Middle Rd., Mattituck): Last year, Jeff Marrone's Pizza Rita graduated from mobile catering truck to bricks-and-mortar store, taking over a workaday slice joint that had never seen this level of artistry. Marrone, who named his pizzeria after his grandmother, is pretty much a one-man show, making the pies, bussing the tables, answering the phones, making his own gelato. All the pies display chewy, leopard-spotted rims and just-this-side-of-lavish toppings; the cannolo (randomly named; bearing no relationship to the dessert) is a symphony of mozzarella (made by the chef), ricotta, sausage, oyster and button mushrooms, finished with pecorino, and extra-virgin olive oil. More info: 631-315-5557. Open Thursday to Sunday.
Pomodorino Rosso (47 Franklin Ave., Valley Stream): At Pomodorino Rosso, Sal Apetino has modified the Neapolitan pie to suit his gas-powered oven. The Naples-born pizzaiolo started learning his craft at Angelo's in Flushing, one of the first wood-burning pizzerias in the city. He went on to work at Il Forno and La Pala in Glen Cove before teaming up with Antonio Bove, the chef-owner of Pomodorino Rosso. Apetino has modified the traditional cornicione - he forms a rim, but it's not as high or puffy. Instead of the traditional leopard spots of char, his crust has a more uniformly golden hue, and the pie is altogether crisper and less floppy than you'd find in Naples. More info: 516-812-6171, pomodorinorosso.com
Salvatore's (124 Shore Rd., Port Washington): Only a coal-burning oven can make an eight-slice pie with this soulful combination of char and creaminess and Salvatore's, which opened in 1996, was the first Long Island pizzeria to use the method pioneered by New York's very first pizzerias, Lombardi's, John's, Totonno's and Patsy's (from which Salvatore's is descended). The pizzaioli here use an unorthodox technique for stretching the dough - rolling pins instead of hand-spinning - but what comes out of the 900-degree oven is the classic New York coal-fired pie. The crust is a dream, crisp but pliant, the topping is a balanced meld of fresh, milky mozzarella and chunky chopped tomatoes punctuated with little nubbins of crumbled sausage. In 2017, ownership of Salvatore's passed from founder Fred Lacagnina to brothers Pat and Dom DeSimone, with no discernible change. More info: 516-883-8457, salvatorescoalovenpizzeria.com
San Marzano Brick Oven Pizzeria (38 Merrick Ave., Merrick): This resolutely nontraditional pie pays less homage to Italy than it does to French and California cuisines. The surprisingly harmonious assemblage brings together Fontina, goat cheese, caramelized onions, shiitake and button mushrooms, garlic and truffle oil. What really puts it over the top is the excellent crust, tender and full of good, wheaty flavor. More info: 516-546-3300
Taglio (85 Mineola Blvd., Mineola): Roman-style pan pizza is the main event at Taglio ("slice" in Italian). The puffy, rectangular pies may look Sicilian but when you examine a slice in cross section, you'll see large air pockets; take a bite and note the elastic-chewy texture, the deep wheaty savor. All of this is the result of a wet, hard-to-handle dough and a dayslong process of fermentation. Chef-owner Rob Cervoni satisfies his customers tastes with "chicken bacon ranch" and eggplant Parm, but the best pies are inspired by Rome's great Pizzarium Bonci. These rotate from week to week but include prosciutto with arugula, and mortadella with artichokes and, the one I wish they had every day, potato with rosemary, a refined combination that, in turn, perplexes, entrances and obsesses. More info: 516-741-0379, tagliopizzany.com
Wild Side Organic Bistro & Bar (1551 Montauk Hwy., Oakdale): When Jay Jadeja and Raquel Wolf moved their restaurant from Hicksville to Oakdale in 2016, they installed a wood-burning brick oven in the new space. Jadeja spent the first few months mastering the Neapolitan art of pizza making; now Wolf has assumed the mantle of chief pizzaiola. Wild Side is a haven for restricted diets, and the vegan marinara pizza here is one of the best, topped only with San Marzano tomatoes, poached garlic, fresh oregano, olive oil and crushed red pepper. For adventurous diners looking for a little Indian-Italian fusion, try the chicken tikka masala pie, silky, mild chicken curry garnished with coriander and cumin seeds, fried green chilies and curry leaves.

9/11 hero Luis Alvarez honored at remembrance

Author: Chayes, Matthew

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Luis Alvarez, the cancer-stricken detective whose congressional testimony is credited with helping secure health care benefits for thousands of fellow Ground Zero responders, was honored at a Brooklyn ceremony Tuesday marking the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
His son David, 28, helped light a memorial candle at the Brooklyn Borough Hall ceremony. The family also accepted a proclamation and received an ovation for Alvarez's NYPD service and his legacy in the fight for health benefits for responders sickened by toxins at the Ground Zero site.
Separately, in Alvarez's Long Island hometown of Oceanside, a park will be renamed in his honor, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran announced Tuesday. 
"This is the first year of 9/11 that we don't have him with us," Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said of Alvarez, 53, a father of three who died June 29 of colorectal and liver cancer tied to his work at Ground Zero.
In June, Alvarez gave gripping testimony during a televised appearance in Washington, D.C., about the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund amid congressional resistance to extend it. Alvarez testified beside activist/comedian Jon Stewart, with both making emotional pleas to extend the health care funding for first responders. 
Alvarez joined the Marines at 18, started at the NYPD in 1990 and was later assigned to the bomb squad. He retired in 2010.
Alvarez's brother Phil Alvarez, speaking at Tuesday's ceremony, recalled getting the call three years ago that his brother was sick.
"He said, 'Bro, I got stage four cancer.' You're not supposed to get that call about your little brother," Phil Alvarez said, adding: "It took 15 years for this thing to catch up with him."
Phil Alvarez described how his brother then went about reaching out to fellow 9/11 responders to urge them to get checked out - a mission he continued on social media.
"You gotta be there for each other," he recalled his brother saying. "You gotta stand tall for one another." 
On Facebook, he would send out details of his chemotherapy: "You know 'Chemo number 5, Chemo number 15, Chemo number 40,'" Phil Alvarez said.  
Phil Alvarez drove with his brother to Washington and sat behind Stewart and him during the testimony. Luis Alvarez had a pump delivering chemotherapy to the liver and could not fly. 
In Oceanside, Curran said, Terrell Avenue Park is to be renamed Detective Luis G. Alvarez Memorial Park.
"This park will serve as a symbol and reminder of his sacrifice and unwavering fight for 9/11 first responders," she said in a statement issued by her office. "We look forward to working with his family to create a tranquil neighborhood space and memorial dedicated in his honor."
Alvarez, Stewart and others noted that the $7 billion fund was being drained and benefits being slashed by up to 70 percent. For years, some Republicans had said they were reluctant to sign such legislation without finding a way to pay for it.
This summer, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill to replenish the victim compensation fund to provide financial support for people who were hurt or who developed diseases after responding to the terror attacks. It will last until 2090.
Alvarez went into hospice soon after testifying before Congress.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking later in the day on the Fox Business Network, lamented that 18 years after the attacks, "We keep losing first responders."
"We've lost first responders, it seems like, every week - there's another person who was there trying to help people, save people, trying to find the bodies of those we lost on that day of tragedy," the mayor said.

Full text: Lido Beach, N.Y. - An 18-year-old man from New York's Long Island was arrested Wednesday and charged in the murder of a 16-year-old student who was stabbed outside a pizza shop earlier this week.
Police charged Tyler Flach of Lido Beach, N.Y., with second-degree murder in connection with the death of Khaseen Morris. Flach will be arraigned on Thursday morning, Nassau County police officials said.
Morris was stabbed once in the chest during an after-school fight Monday near Oceanside High School. Flach was allegedly one of about eight from a nearby high school. The fight may have been in retaliation for Morris spending time with one of their ex-girlfriends.
Police said between 50 and 70 teens watched the bloody brawl, at least some of them recording the fight on their cell phones, all while failing to do anything to defend Morris from his attackers. Morris was rushed to a hospital where he died, Newsday reported.
"Kids stood there and didn't help Khaseen," Detective Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick of the Nassau County Police Department said at a news conference Tuesday. "They videoed his death instead of helping him."
Also Wednesday, Nassau County police assigned extra officers to Oceanside High School in response to a threat made against the school.
Hundreds attended candlelight vigils Tuesday and Wednesday evening held in the parking lot where the fatal brawl took place, Newsday reported. A second teenager was hospitalized with a broken arm and swelling to his head after Monday's fight.

Full text: Naples Street Food in Franklin Square already makes some of Long Island's best pizza. Now owner-pizzaiolo Gianluca Chiarolanza is making a bid for the best pasta. He's brought on board a partner, Gigi Sacchetti, and the Florence-born chef is in the kitchen making more than two dozen authentic Italian pasta dishes. He's also in the restaurant's basement, making his own busiate, corzetti, lasagna, pappardelle, pici, strozzapreti, tonnarelli, tortelloni; the list goes on.
Sacchetti, who helmed the Manhattan restaurants La Cantina Toscana and La Cippolla Rossa in the early 2000s, made a splash on Long Island in 2017 when he headlined at Da Gigi in Lynbrook, and earned three stars from Newsday. A year later he headed south to Oceanside where he upped the pasta ante at Noble Kitchen & Cocktails. (Da Gigi was recently transformed into Abbracciamento.)
Naples Street Food suits him better than either restaurant. First, there's the Italian-born Chiarolanza, who is as uncompromising about ingredients and traditional methods as he is. There's no need to explain why the Pecorino Romano must be Fulvi brand, why pancetta (cured pork belly) can't be used in place of guanciale (cured pig jowl). He's more at home in the super-casual pizzeria than in a fancy restaurant, and with only about 20 seats, he can do most of the cooking with his own two hands.
Sacchetti's menu is an object lesson in regional Italian pastas: From Emlia Romagna, lasagna Bolognese; from Sicily, busiate Trapanese with tomato-almond pesto; from Sardinia, spaghetti alla bottarga; from Rome, spaghetti alla carbonara, bucatini all'Amatriciana and tonnarelli alla gricia; from Naples, paccheri al ragu Napoletano; from Liguria, trofie Genovese; from Umbria, strozzapreti alla Norcina. Again, the list goes on.
Of course Chiarolanza's superb pizza Napoletana is also available, along with oven-baked panozzi sandwiches and starters such as panelle (chickpea fritters) and arancini (rice balls).
Naples Street Food (which opened a larger Oceanside location in May) plans to expand the original, Franklin Square space in 2020, at which point seating will more than double and wine and beer will be available.

New Chinese eatery opens in East Setauket
The Stony Brook Chinese-restaurant boom, which has spread east to Centereach and Selden, is now making inroads north into East Setauket. Jiang Hu has opened in the little peaked-roof building that used to be Little Joe's III pizzeria (where it shares quarters with Cupeez Drive-Thru).
The menu concentrates on the authentic Chinese cuisine of a number of regions: soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, seaweed-pork soup red-braised pork belly with chestnuts, salt-and-pepper shrimp, cumin lamb and spicy kidneys. A specialty of the house is whole fish braised in a hot pot at your table. Starters are all under $9; most mains stay below $20. (Diners looking for what the menu calls "American dishes" will find General Tso's and Kung-Pao chicken, shrimp with broccoli, orange chicken and more, almost all priced below $15.)
Jiangnan Zheng owned three restaurants in his native Fuzhou, in southeastern China, before moving to New York three years ago. After buying a house in Miller Place, he spent a year looking for and hiring staff for his first Long Island restaurant, which he hopes will appeal to both Chinese immigrants, like himself, and American-born customers. "If Americans order four dishes, I will try to get them to order one authentic Chinese dish." He's had luck introducing newbies to sliced pork with onion and pepper, chili beef and spicy shrimp.
Both types of customers are well advised to come by for lunch where select "American" dishes can be had for $9.50 plus soup and rice; select authentic Chinese dishes are served, over rice, for $11.95.
It's an attractive little place, done up in shades of pickled wood, teal and aqua. For now, the pizzeria's deck ovens are still in situ, between dining room and kitchen, but they are hidden by a row of curtains. 
Jiang Hu is at 30 Route 25A, East Setauket, 631-364-9811, jianghu.us.

HONORING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS: AN ANNUAL GIFT OF A HEARTFELT SEDER

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Not a day goes by that Rachel Epstein doesn't remember how the Nazis took away her mother and father.
Still, there are days for Epstein that shine with a brightness that reminds her how good people can be.
Wednesday was one of those days.
Epstein, of Roslyn, and some 85 other Holocaust survivors and their guests attended a pre-seder meal to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Passover.
The feast is now in its ninth year, started by Ellen Grossman of Great Neck to help her mark a special birthday. She tells the story the best.
"I decided to do something meaningful to me, as opposed to just having friends get me some new pocketbook or necklace," Grossman said. "We decided to do something for Holocaust survivors. For some reason, it touched me."
Grossman joined forces with the UJA-Federation of New York, where she has been a volunteer for years, to pull together the celebration. She reached out to friends for money. With $10,000 in donations, she catered a robust spread for about 100 survivors and guests at the Barry and Florence Friedberg Jewish Community Center in Oceanside.
Over the years, Grossman has come to know the survivors - and appreciate them. They have deepened her understanding of the Holocaust.
"Look at everything they have sacrificed so we as Jews can continue to give to the world," she said,
Grossman marvels at their resilience, both in wartime and now later in life. Some, she has learned, have no family to join with on Passover, which commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. Their children are far away, and many loved ones have died.
And yet they have a zest for living.
"They don't say, 'Poor me,' " Grossman said. "They say, 'I'm happy I'm here. Thank you for another day.' That's a role model."
For Epstein, who was 10 when the Nazis invaded her homeland of France, the seder let her reflect and give thanks.
"The people are so wonderful to us," Epstein said. "I've met such wonderful people."
Epstein recalled how the French police, working with the Nazis, took away her parents. Her father, a tailor, had known the officers. The police acted like her father and mother were strangers, she said.
She never saw her parents again. They died at Auschwitz, the largest of the Nazi concentration camps.
Epstein and her younger brother were taken in by a Christian family that lived in their building. The family raised the pair "like we were born to them," she said. After the war, they went to live with an aunt and uncle.
Epstein sat at a table near Edmund Rosenblum, 98, of West Hempstead. Rosenblum and his family had to live in hiding in Vienna.
His father had served in the army during World War I; when the Nazis started rounding up Jews, an old war friend of his father's came to the family's aid, he said.
"They hid us on the top floor, where the laundry was done," he said. He couldn't even go outside to play.
When his family arrived in the United States, they sailed past the Statue of Liberty "with tears in our eyes," Rosenblum said. He went to night school and was drafted into the Army during World War II.
On Wednesday, Rosenblum wore a black ball cap that proclaimed his status as an American veteran. All around him, the other survivors feasted on salmon, hard-boiled eggs, potatoes, gefilte fish and matzo. Cantor Ofer Barnoy, of Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights, offered a service and played traditional songs on an acoustic guitar.
Grossman intends to keep marking her birthday every year with the seder. The survivors, in a way, have become her extended family. When one isn't feeling well, she sends a card. If someone misses the seder, she sends a plate of food home.
"This is something I've promised to do until there are no survivors left," she said. "Now I have a connection, an awareness. These are people."

Full text: If it's true that sixth-grader Bella Moscato's teacher discouraged her from writing about her hero, President Donald Trump, for a class assignment, then the teacher acted inappropriately ["Student gets letter from her hero Trump," News, April 25]. However, Bella's mother may wish to address the teacher's rationale with her daughter.
I teach at a public charter school in Brooklyn with a heavy immigrant population where it would be unlikely for children to write about Trump as their hero, but I'd support any student who chose to do so.
Even my school's youngest students are aware of other children who share their ethnicity being interned and separated from their parents at the Southern border as a result of Trump's policy. Our Muslim students understand the implications of the president's fiery rhetoric, as do students whose families hail from African nations the president has described with an expletive.
Given the chance, I'd ask Bella's mother, who said she doesn't care what Trump did 20 years ago, whether she was concerned with the lewd comments he made on a 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape. Would she address with Bella the president's profanity-laced tweets, and would she let Bella use such language so as not to censor her daughter's First Amendment rights?
Jason Gorbel,
  Oceanside
People can vote for whoever they believe represents their policy priorities, including Donald Trump. However, encouraging a child to hero-worship a serial bully is both sad and scary. Knowing what we now know about the insidious effects of bullying, and especially the sometimes life-threatening toll it takes on young people, I would hope that responsible adults would encourage children to admire and emulate those who display a high level of respect, compassion and tolerance, regardless of their political preferences.
Linda Lesner,
  Oceanside
An article taking up a full page about a letter a student received from President Donald Trump? Obviously, this child was coached by the parent who said she didn't care what Trump did, 10, 20 or 30 years ago.
Well maybe her daughter will care when she realizes what he did. Trump encouraged Bella to show her leadership. Maybe he should show his.
Elizabeth Leyser,
  Hicksville
Utility of Vivitrol is often overstated
We are only now hearing about Vivitrol as a treatment for opioid addiction because of past problems in its marketing and price ["A drug to help addicts," News, April 14].
Vivitrol's aggressive marketing initially targeted habitual opioid users, who were unlikely to inject themselves to decrease the effects of their high. Functioning chemically like Narcan (naloxone), Vivitrol blocks all types of opioid receptors.
Various medication assisted treatments (MAT) are necessary to combat the opioid crisis. However, the utility of Vivitrol is often overstated. It can be difficult for those who seek MAT to rely solely on Vivitrol due to its sudden action and intermittent use: Patients are deprived of the guidance through the gradual decline that will keep them off opiates for years to come.
Concurrently, the abuse potential of Suboxone is grossly overstated. It is a partial opiate combined with Naloxone, a drug with the same chemical action as Vivitrol. The abuse potential of Suboxone is low; it suppresses all activity on every opioid receptors but one, where it acts at low strength in only some receptors.
The benefits of Vivitrol should be considered more realistically: More medical oversight and a gradual detox are a benefit, not a detriment.

Sanzone's 2 HRs lift East Meadow: Rightfielder has five RBIs; Kelly goes distance

Full text: The East Meadow softball players and coaches tried everything they could think of to stay ready for whenever their first county final game would be played.
With two weather cancellations, the days off between the semifinals and finals mounted.
"Itching and waiting," outfielder Julianna Sanzone said. "Practice indoor, at the batting cages, you name it, we're doing it."
And when the time came to step back on the field, the Jets were ready - nobody more than Sanzone. The junior rightfielder went 3-for-4 with two home runs and five RBIs as top-seeded East Meadow defeated No. 2 Oceanside, 7-2, in Game 1 of a best-of-three Nassau Class AA championship Friday afternoon at Hofstra.
"As the season gets later, she gets better," coach Stew Fritz said. "She's a big-game player."
Sanzone had a three-run home run in the third inning to give East Meadow a 4-2 lead, and followed with a solo home run in her next at-bat in the fifth inning to give the Jets a 6-2 advantage.
"On the first home run I was like, 'Wow, that felt really nice' and the second one felt just as good," Sanzone said. "I just stayed up there and relaxed and it was amazing."
East Meadow (17-4) and Oceanside (14-10) play Game 2 at 4:30 p.m. Saturday at Hofstra, with the Jets one win away from their third straight Nassau Class AA crown.
Alex Kelly tossed a complete game, surrendering two runs (one earned) on four hits with no walks and one strikeout for East Meadow. Isabella Shepherd and Stephanie Christoforatos each scored two runs and Grace Pohalski added an RBI single for the Jets.
East Meadow also had key defensive contributions, including a diving catch in foul territory by catcher Rosanna Cuttone for the final out of the fifth inning with runners on first and second and the Jets leading 5-2.
"She made a great play and they were rallying," Fritz said. "To me, at the time, it was a game saver."

Full text: A group of Long Island knitters gathered in Roslyn on Sunday to send their love and sympathy to the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh the best way they know how - via their knitting needles and bundles of yarn.
The two dozen women at the Old Northern Boulevard store Knit Long Island will create an Afghan featuring Jewish imagery in honor of the shooting victims. The event was part of a worldwide movement of knitters doing the same as a response to the Oct. 27 shooting when a gunman walked into the synagogue during Shabbat morning services and opened fire, killing 11 people and injuring seven.
The Roslyn knitters each crafted a 9-by-8.5-inch square featuring the Star of David or the Tree of Life symbol using a cashmere and merino wool blend donated by Great Neck-based yarn supplier Knitting Fever. Store owner Cheryl Levanhar will continue to collect squares until Friday and plans to sew them into a blanket to be delivered to a Pittsburgh-area knitting shop, Yarns By Design, on Dec. 1.
"This is a very Jewish community, and there are a lot of people who were touched by [the synagogue shooting] on a religious level," said Levanhar, who is Jewish.
The movement began with social media posts by Yarns By Design a day after the shooting asking for squares as a show of solidarity. Posts on knitting social media site Ravelry.com show that knitters from around the globe answered the call.
"I don't think that store in Pittsburgh has any idea what they've taken on," Levanhar said.
Knitter Kim Kantor, 35, of Oceanside, said this is not the first time her knitting has paired with an event of national note. She knitted pink hats for the Women's March in January 2017.
The latest craft is also an inherently giving act, appropriate for sending positivity to a shattered community, she said.
"Knitters love making stuff for people. Once you have your own hat and glove set, it's like "OK, who else needs one,'  " said Kantor, an Orthodox Jew. "And while you're knitting, you're thinking about that person."
The Old Northern Boulevard store is a hangout where knitters, including widows and retirees, gather to talk, snack and create. One square can take up to six hours to complete, Levanhar noted, but the labor is part of the gift.
"It's a way to show my love," said Patti Morgese, 54, of Garden City, a frequent patron of the store, who is not of the Jewish faith. "It's a horrific thing that happened, and if this can bring just a little peace to someone's heart ... it's a wonderful thing."
Beverly Osrow, 81, of Great Neck agreed.
"Not that this is going to change anything," she said, "but it's an expression of how people feel."

Full text: Suffolk finances got worse after 2011
The Nov. 18 news story on Suffolk County's operating debt, "Debt takes bite out of budget," included examples of borrowing over the past decade. I wish to make it clear that my administration, which ended in 2011, rejected borrowing for salaries or selling buildings we owned outright, only to rent them back.
Cost-saving measures cited in the story, including trimming the workforce by 1,000 people, stemmed from my budget, and it was my administration that began privatizing health care facilities and selling the county nursing home.
The article cited five bond rating downgrades. All occurred in the succeeding administration. Not mentioned was that the fiscally responsible measures we employed led to an unprecedented seven straight bond rating upgrades during my tenure.
Steve Levy,
Bayport
Editor's note: The writer was Suffolk County executive from 2004 through 2011.
The trouble with early snowstorms
I watched as New York Mayor Bill de Blasio defended his response to the snowstorm on Nov. 14. Let's face it, New Yorkers: Accidents that contributed to traffic jams were not caused by the mayor or a few inches of snow . Common sense dictates that we slow down in bad weather. Drivers in a hurry put all at risk. Much of the chaos could have been avoided with a little caution.
Linda A. Petrizzi, Oceanside
Please explain why the go-to response from officials for the inadequate snow preparation is always, "Well, it was the first snow of the season." News flash: This was not the first snowstorm ever.

JFK assassination shook Americans
I am quite surprised that Newsday gave so little attention on Nov. 22 to the 55th anniversary of the assassination of our 35th president, John F. Kennedy. It was noted only on Page A14 in your "This date in history" feature.
My wife and I recall the day as if it were yesterday. I was 18. You cannot imagine how people felt then. How sad that the anniversary did not get more attention. I fault educators for not giving history more emphasis in U.S. schools.

Treehouse fuss is municipal overreach
Leave the treehouse and the Lepper family alone! The story of the Babylon homeowner being fined for an illegal treehouse is a clear example of municipal overreach and a simple money grab .
Local codes and ordinances are written in a cumbersome and convoluted manner to give municipalities the advantage and the citizen no option but to comply with illogical decisions.
James T. Rooney, Centerport
End practice of cross-endorsements
With the 2018 election over, two things are very clear: The way New York handles ballot access, especially for minor parties, is hurtful to outside viewpoints, and fusion voting must end.
While it is hard to blame minor parties for putting forth candidates who would ensure the 50,000 votes they require to remain on the ballot for the next four years, the fact remains that state law that allows individuals to take multiple ballot lines permits parties to look for the stronger candidate, not the best candidate. For example, the Working Families Party switched from supporting actress Cynthia Nixon for governor to incumbent Andrew M. Cuomo, although the governor did not change any policy positions. Moreover, the election actually saw three parties secure future ballot access by not cross-endorsing: the Libertarian, Green and Serve America Movement parties.
By allowing cross-endorsements, New York says to voters that there are only two viewpoints. This suppresses views outside the mainstream that could have a substantial impact on an election. End fusion voting and let the people's voices be heard.
Gavi Hoffman, West Hempstead
Christmas overtakes Thanksgiving
On Nov. 22, I turned on the TV to watch the Thanksgiving Day parade, though admittedly not at the beginning .
I was under the impression that Thanksgiving is a holiday dedicated to giving thanks for what we have in our lives. Instead, all we saw were things associated with Christmas. There were Christmas floats, Christmas songs from celebrities and all sorts of Christmas decorations.
I have nothing against the celebration of Christmas, but this was supposed to be a Thanksgiving celebration. If it is just a general holiday celebration, where were the mentions of Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and other holidays of the season? If it is only a Christmas parade, call it a Christmas parade.
In my youth long ago, I recall that Santa's arrival at the end of the parade marked the beginning of the Christmas season. Now, it seems that we have been in it all along. I wonder when it started. Perhaps Jan. 1?

Full text: An Oceanside man was arrested early Sunday morning after he allegedly knocked on a man's door and pointed a shotgun at him, Nassau County police said.
Ryan Mueller, 26, and the victim, 26, knew each other, police said, but a spokesman was not familiar with the nature of their relationship. The spokesman also did not have information about what may have led to the incident.
Mueller allegedly knocked on the door of the man's Pearl Street home in Oceanside and pointed the weapon at him, police said in a news release. The man closed the door and Mueller fled. He was found at his Davis Street home and arrested shortly before 1 a.m.
Police found two assault rifles, six high-capacity magazines, a long gun, a switchblade knife and fireworks at Mueller's home, the release stated.
He is charged with eight counts of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, two counts of criminal possession of a firearm, second-degree menacing, fourth-degree possession of a dangerous weapon, fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon and unlawfully dealing with fireworks, according to the release.
He was arraigned Monday in First District Court in Hempstead and held on $22,500 bond or $15,000 cash, according to online records.

 - PETER M. GIANOTTI HED HERE Flaky empanadas filled with roasted plantains, jackfruit and the more traditional beef or chicken have landed in a swath of Westbury often brimming with shoppers looking for a quick snack.
The second location of Jessy's Pastries, owned by former teacher (and current vegan) Jessy Nahmias, opened in mid-September in a sunny corner space on Old Country Road, across from the Source Mall. A chalkboard lists Jessy's core empanadas of beef, chicken, spinach and mozzarella, mac-and-cheese, and black bean. In a glass case is an expanded roster of both meat and vegan empanadas stuffed with jackfruit and sweet potato, roasted vegetables with pineapple, and soy chorizo and plantain.
Savory empanadas - which are baked, rather than fried - cost $3.75 each, or two for $6.50. The cafe has a handful of tables; order the pastries to go and the empanadas will be packed into individually labeled paper sleeves and tucked into a white box along with a vivid cilantro-jalapeño green dipping sauce.
On the sweet side are empanadas filled with Nutella or guava and cream cheese, or Nahmias' Peruvian-style pastries, such as the buttery sandwich cookies known as alfajores, plus vegan banana bread, brownies, macaroons and cannolis. Alfajores can come powdered with sugar, filled with Nutella or rum-infused dulce de leche, or rolled in coconut flakes, and cost $1.50 each or 12 for $15.
Lima, Peru-born Nahmias - who got started by selling alfajores on Etsy, and empanadas at food festivals and school fairs - opened her first brick-and-mortar location on Long Beach Road in Oceanside in 2016. Production remains in Oceanside, but the empanadas are baked on site in both places daily.
Jessy's Pastries is at 469 Old Country Rd., Westbury; 516-280-4220, jessyspastries.com

NASSAU FACES $19M JUDGMENT: LATEST COURT AWARD AGAINST STRAPPED COUNTY STEMS FROM 2014 COLLISION

Author: Eidler, Scott

Full text: Nassau County faces a $19 million judgment after a jury found the county and a motorist liable in connection with a 2014 collision that left a motorcyclist seriously injured.
The suit from Roni Kota, 55, of Port Washington, said the county should have installed a traffic light at a busy Port Washington intersection where he was struck by a car in 2014. A jury last week ruled against the county and the driver, Erin M. Reilly, for the crash at Shore Road and Harbor Road. Last week a jury awarded Kota $4 million for past pain and suffering, and $15 million for future pain and suffering. Kota's left leg was amputated below his knee after the crash, said his attorney, David Dean of Manhattan.
The verdict is among several hefty, unbudgeted judgments threatening the county's precarious finances. In February, Nassau County paid a $45 million legal judgment to Dennis Halstead and John Restivo in a wrongful imprisonment case after serving 18 years in jail. The two were exonerated, along with another man, for the 1984 rape and murder of 16-year-old Theresa Fusco of Lynbrook.
On Wednesday, a county legislative committee approved a $25 million settlement with the family of Nicollette Iacone, of Oceanside, 11 years after a car accident left her with a traumatic brain injury. She was 17 in 2007 when the car she was driving collided with a pickup truck driven by Salvatore Passanisi, who later pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated. Iacone's suit alleged the county failed to maintain the Oceanside intersection where the crash occurred. Hedges, an electrical box and signage blocked the view of the intersection, the suit said.
Kota's lawyer, Dean, said the county has received complaints about the intersection and that previous county traffic studies were inadequate.
Kota was driving north on Shore Road when he collided with Reilly, who was driving in the opposite direction, Dean said. Kota, now 55, lived in Port Washington with his family, and commuted to Manhattan on his motorcycle for a construction job.
"It's a real county screw-up, and the jury understood it right away," Dean said in an interview Thursday.
Karen Contino, a Nassau County spokeswoman, said, "The county cannot comment on pending litigation and is exploring its options."
County Executive Laura Curran earlier this week announced a "comprehensive assessment of traffic information" and criticized past staffing reductions in the Department of Public Works. Curran, who took office Jan. 1, has funded new positions in that department in her 2019 budget proposal, including professional engineers in the traffic engineering unit.

Full text: Nassau County police said two off-duty NYPD officers saw a man climbing the fence outside an Oceanside home, beginning a chain of events that led to the arrest of the man on several charges.
But first, the man hit the NYPD officers with his car, police said.
The NYPD officers called 911 after they saw the man climb the fence and enter the home on Anchor Avenue about 1:05 p.m. Wednesday, Nassau police said.
While the NYPD officers waited for Nassau officers to arrive, the man came out of the house with a knife on his hip, pushed past the officers and got into a 2007 Nissan Sentra that had a woman and a child inside, police said.
"The subject sped away, striking both officers with his car, causing injuries. Both officers were transported to a hospital for treatment," police said in a news release.
The car was registered to Nicholas Ulip, 24, who was arrested at 2:40 p.m. at his home on Harvey Avenue in Oceanside, police said.
Ulip was awaiting arraignment Thursday in First District Court in Hempstead on charges of assault, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal trespass, leaving the scene of an accident and endangering the welfare of a child, police said.
Police said Ulip knew the woman and child in the car, but police did not know his relationship to them.

Full text: A homeless man is responsible for 15 thefts from Rite Aid and Stop & Shop stores in Nassau County within a seven-week period, police said Wednesday.
Andre Christmas, 49, faces multiple counts of grand larceny and petit larceny, Nassau police said. Christmas was arrested Tuesday afternoon after the latest theft at a Stop & Shop store on Atlantic Avenue in Oceanside, police said.
Christmas allegedly took merchandise from the store without paying and then took a cab, which officers stopped, police said.
"The defendant was observed in the rear passenger seat with the merchandise and placed under arrest without incident," police said.
The cabdriver was not aware the merchandise had been stolen, police said.
Police said detectives determined Christmas was responsible for 14 other thefts from Rite Aid and Stop & Shop stores since April 21. The stores are located in Oceanside, Carle Place, West Hempstead, North Bellmore, Levittown, Franklin Square and Elmont.
Police did not say how they linked Christmas to the thefts.

Long Beach search for swimmer, 8, continues overnight: The boy and his brother struggled in rough waves near Ocean Beach Park, then became separated, city officials say

Full text: The boy missing in the waters off Long Beach is 10 years old and the beaches are fully open for the summer on Saturday. The age was incorrect based on information provided by authorities and the opening day was incorrect in a story Wednesday. (Pg. 18 6/21/18)
By John Asbury Ellen Yan

An 10-year-old Hempstead boy disappeared while swimming off Long Beach Tuesday, and the Coast Guard planned to search by boat through the night.
The Coast Guard called off its air search late Tuesday night and was to go back up in the air at daybreak.
"The child may not be able to wave his arms, but we'll do our best to find him," said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Steve Strohmaier.
Long Beach city officials, who called off their search just before 9:30 p.m., were also to return in the morning.
"We'll be back in the morning to scour the shoreline," Long Beach lifeguard chief Paul Gillespie said.
The boy and his 11-year-old brother were swimming near Ocean Beach Park, off Edwards Boulevard, when they became separated just before 6 p.m., Long Beach city officials said.
The water started getting rough and they both began struggling, police and fire officials said. As the older brother returned to shore, he looked back and didn't see his brother, they said.
After about two hours of searching, Long Beach fire and police officials had deemed the effort a recovery mission. They pulled all lifeguards from the water, leaving divers, boats, Jet Skis and helicopters in the canvass.
The search, also conducted by the NYPD, Coast Guard and Nassau police, covered about a quarter-mile from shore and in water coves about 15 feet deep at the end of the jetty, authorities said.
The surface water was about 62 degrees, authorities said.
Long Beach Fire Commissioner Scott Kemins said the water wasn't particularly rough, but choppy water and riptides always exist. "It's the Atlantic Ocean. You never put your guard down," he said.
The 11-year-old was taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, where his mother joined him, officials said.
Police said they had many unanswered questions, including how the boys got to the beach. It appeared the children did not get there with their parents, police said, because officers had been trying to find their parents early in the evening.
Lifeguards aren't on duty full-time until Friday, when the beaches are fully open for the summer, city officials said.
Long Beach police and fire departments had been searching since they got a call about the missing boy about 5:50 p.m.
At one point, about 30 off-duty lifeguards also were in the water, along with Hempstead Town lifeguards, public safety officials and first responders from the Island Park, Wantagh, East Rockaway and Atlantic Beach fire departments.
The Coast Guard dispatched a small boat from its Jones Beach station, and two helicopters, one from Atlantic City and another one from Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Sparkler safety concerns on LI: Local bans aim to save children, seen as most vulnerable

Author: Griffith, Janelle

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]01 July 2018: 7.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This Fourth of July, not a single spark will fly on Long Island.
Nassau and Suffolk counties have both banned sparklers in response to concerns from fire officials, volunteer firefighters and medical experts.
"Nobody untrained should be touching fireworks, and that's of any kind," said John Murray, 68, who has been a Rockville Centre firefighter for more than 50 years. "Sparklers look so innocent, but they aren't."
Medical and some industry experts agree.  
Across the country, records show nearly every firework-related injury to children 4 and younger is due to sparklers, which can be ground-based or handheld.
Their colorful and simple nature make them especially alluring to young children, experts say. But a sparkler's tip can burn at around 2,000 degrees.
In his 14 years as a burn surgeon, Dr. Steven Sandoval has treated only children for sparkler-related injuries.
"All it takes is a second to have a second-degree burn," said Sandoval, director of the Burn Center at Stony Brook University Hospital.
Sandoval, along with Suffolk County fire houses and volunteer firefighters, are among the most vocal against local sale of sparklers. In Nassau, Murray, chief instructor at the Nassau County Firefighters Museum and Education Center, and Steven Klein, vice president of the Firemen's Association for the State of New York, pushed for the ban.
Klein, a 50-year member of the Oceanside Fire Department, said  improperly stored fireworks can also pose a hidden danger to firefighters responding to a fire.
"There's potential for injury all year round," said Klein, 71.
Dan Creagan, of the Michigan-based Pyrotechnic Guild International, said sparklers are one of the most dangerous consumer fireworks because they burn at an incredibly high heat.
"I'm kind of surprised that people haven't become concerned about them earlier," said Creagan, who has worked in the fireworks industry for almost two decades. "I think New York's laws can sometimes be limiting, but I think in this case, I completely understand it."
In 2017, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that 68 percent of the total estimated fireworks-related injuries in 2016 occurred in the month surrounding July Fourth, with nearly one-third of those injured being children.
Sparklers are legal to sell in New York State around the July Fourth and New Year's Eve holidays, except in counties that have placed their own bans. Nassau and Suffolk both did so in June. New York City also prohibits them. 
When sparklers are easily accessible at certain times of year, people may feel they are safe to put in the hands of children, Creagan said.
Now, using a sparkler on Long Island can result in a fine of up to $500. Anyone selling the devices could face 15 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Creagan's only fear with the ban is it will hurt the entire fireworks industry.
"There's always the worry that there will be a domino effect against all consumer fireworks and there shouldn't be," Creagan said.  
Consumer fireworks revenue rose to $885 million in 2017 from $825 million in 2016, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association.
Natalie Iovino-Schoenfeld, a Miller Place resident, said she thinks the ban overreaches. Her young daughter Abby got a small burn on her foot last summer when a stray spark from a sparkler landed inside her shoe.
Iovino-Schoenfeld said if there wasn't a ban, she would allow her children - ages 2 and 4 - to handle sparklers with supervision around age 7, when she believes they would be old enough to understand the risks involved.
Sparklers, when used properly, are no  more dangerous than a candle or match, said Iovino-Schoenfeld, 35.
Sandoval said he sees 4 to 8 young patients admitted to the hospital for sparkler and other fireworks-related injuries each year.
Incidents involving sparklers are often the result of sparks hitting a child in the face or setting fire to clothing.
"Some of the worst we have seen is hand burns or burns to the body," Sandoval said, adding the latter would require a child wear special clothing while their burns healed.  
Some parents think allowing kids to play with sparklers is a safer alternative to fireworks, experts say.
"The problem is they're giving them something more dangerous than a firework," Sandoval said. "The firework - at least you light it up and throw it. With a sparkler, you're meant to hold on to it."

One scary-looking beetle

Full text: Hi Jessica: I found these insects in my pool today, and the dark one with the long antennae really gave me pause. I'm not sure you are also the "insect detective," but thought maybe you could help. - John Carter, Oceanside
Dear John: Every now and then an insect (or plant disease) gives me pause as well. This long-horned beetle certainly is a looker. I checked with Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann, a senior extension associate and entomologist with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County in Babylon. She believes your visitor is a prionus beetle.
With its spiked horns and large size, the insect certainly appears menacing, and not without reason: as a root borer, it has very strong jaws. Handling these insects is not advisable.
Several local critters, particularly skunks, regularly hunt them for food. The good news is that prionus beetles don't hunt humans. 
Dear Jessica: My tomato plants are losing the bottom leaves. They brown, then dry up. They are watered with soaker hoses on a timer. - Bruce Keeler, Malverne
Dear Bruce: Without a photo or more details, I can't properly diagnose your plants, but from your description and the timing of your email (late June) my best, educated guess would be that your plants are suffering from either early blight, or verticilium or fusarium wilt. Regardless, your plants still should be producing, despite their ratty appearance.
Practice good sanitation by cleaning up fallen leaves and clearing beds of diseased plant parts at the end of the season. Avoid overhead watering, which encourages the growth of mold, mildew and fungi - and spreads disease - and instead use soaker hoses or at least direct the hose water at the soil, not plants. Be sure to allow ample space between plants, and stake or cage them properly to keep them off the ground and allow for proper air circulation between and wit

The power behind the pretty: Symbols of growth, hope and healing add something extra to LI jewelers' pieces

Full text: Peek in the back of Kathleen DiResta's shop in Sea Cliff, and you may find her polishing a new piece of jewelry. Sometimes, she admits, it's just pretty. Other times, it's something more.
Her Lotus Leaf pendant, for instance, is inspired by the lines of a lotus flower, which in Buddhism "symbolizes enlightenment, purity and growth," says DiResta. She believes the Zen qualities of the pendant can help a person feel grounded and improved clarity (if she adds a white topaz bead) or positivity (from turquoise).
East Moriches designer Rebecca Dolber's crystal stacker bracelets address emotional or spiritual needs - smoky quartz, to increase intuition; or amazonite, "the stone of female warriors - always a hit," says Dolber.
DiResta and Dolber revel in the "something more" of jewelry design, creating pieces that they believe do more than look good - they DO good, the women say, with special components reputed to help the wearer feel more inspired, energized, balanced, maybe even healthier.
THERAPY OR SHOPPING?
For some customers, this may sound too out there - perhaps more like therapy than shopping.
"It is like therapy," Dolber admits. "People are pulled in by the color in a display, but they often open up to me."
For other designers, the drive to create jewelry with purpose stems from personal strife.
Like Manhasset designer Simone I. Smith - wife of actor and rapper (and Bay Shore native) LL Cool J. Diagnosed with a rare bone cancer in 2004, she underwent surgery that left the lollipop tattoo on her leg looking "like someone took a bite out of it," she recalls. She created A Sweet Touch of Hope, a line of lollipop pendants in that same bitten shape, as a way to inspire other cancer survivors, who are "some of the most resilient people I've ever met," she says.
Then there's 24ave, another Manhasset-based brand specializing in inspirational apparel and jewelry, run by North Shore natives Kerri Kahn, Francine Aulicino and Gale Federman. Back in 2013, Kahn, a recovering drug addict and alcoholic, was in search of a gift to celebrate the anniversary of a friend's sobriety - and couldn't find anything appropriate. The brand she co-founded now offers hand-stamped necklaces and bracelets with meaningful messages (like "ODAAT" - one day at a time). The brand has since grown beyond sobriety, with gear celebrating empowerment of all individuals.
This is jewelry that goes beyond the sparkle.
"Our mission," says Federman, "is to provide customers with beautiful products and positive, inspiring messages to live their lives by."
DO CRYSTALS REALLY WORK?
Yes, they're pretty, but whether crystals - chunks of quartz and other minerals - can actually affect your health or mood is debatable.
"I've always been intrigued by crystals and gemstones," says Oceanside jewelry designer Idayne Kaye particularly when it "comes from Mother Earth."
Adherents believe energies in stones can interact with human energy fields, or chakras, but there's no credible scientific research backing that up. Sensations people feel are likely a placebo effect - mind over matter, say scientists. But here's the curious thing about placebos - they can actually work.
In a 2016 study, Stony Brook University neurologist Anat Biegon and colleagues found that 15 percent of patients responded to a placebo treatment; other studies go as high as 70 percent. So wearing crystals may not be so crazy after all.

Long Beach needs $12 million more to start Bay Park sewage project: The city has received $6 million so far in grants to build a pipeline that would transfer treated sewage away from Reynolds Channel

Author: Asbury, John

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Beach has received $6 million in grants to build a pipeline to send treated sewage to Bay Park in East Rockaway, but the city remains $12 million short of its initial goal.
City officials were awarded $2.5 million last month in grants by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's Regional Economic Development Council to convert the city's wastewater treatment plant into a pumping station that can ultimately send sewage to Bay Park.
The city also received a $3.5 million water infrastructure grant last year, but was turned down for a $7 million intermunicipal water infrastructure grant, city Public Works director John Mirando said.
Ultimately, the state's plan is to send treated sewage through a pipeline under Sunrise Highway to Cedar Creek in Wantagh and release it 3 miles out into the Atlantic Ocean, where it can be more greatly diluted. The wastewater now goes into Reynolds Channel, the narrow body of water between the island Long Beach sits on and Long Island proper. The total project is expected to cost about $50 million.
Long Beach and Lido Beach send 4.2 million gallons of treated sewage daily into Reynolds Channel. The city is responsible for about 5 percent of nitrogen levels in the bay, but will not be able to meet future state environmental standards for nitrogen and ammonia.
To begin transferring sewage, Long Beach must first construct a 3.5-mile pipeline to connect to an existing pipeline down Austin Boulevard in Oceanside, which is expected to cost $18 million, Mirando said.
"It's still only one part of this project," Mirando said. "It's a critical component, so we can then build the pump station and bypass our wastewater station."
Long Beach officials plan to seek additional grants this year to make up the funding shortage. The city is also pursuing an intermunicipal agreement with Nassau County for duplicate work needed.
The total project, including building the 24-inch pipe to Oceanside, switching to Bay Park and pumping to Cedar Creek using an existing New York City aqueduct, could take about seven years, Mirando said.
"The goal is to get the nitrogen and ammonia out of Reynolds Channel and clean it up significantly," Mirando said.
Officials with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation said Long Beach was selected as a "high priority project" to eliminate the discharge of treated sewage into the channel.
Converting the city's treatment plant could also potentially bring sewers to Point Lookout.
Long Beach's 70-year-old wastewater treatment plant was damaged during superstorm Sandy and remains vulnerable to future storms and flooding on the bayfront, state environmental officials said. The pumping station will be designed to operate during severe storms.
Cleaning up Reynolds Channel will not only improve the environment for fishing, and maybe someday recreational use, but could also restore dry marshes as a critical storm barrier, Long Beach Corporation Counsel Rob Agostisi said.

Lindenhurst wins Rutgers Trophy as Suffolk's top football team: The Bulldogs earn 124 points to edge Westhampton with 120

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Another long wait ended for Lindenhurst on Monday night when - in an extremely close vote - it was awarded the 2017 Rutgers Trophy as the most outstanding football team in Suffolk County.
Coached by Nick Lombardo for a ninth straight season, Lindenhurst (12-0) earned 26 first-place votes and 124 points. Westhampton, which also went 12-0 and won the Long Island Class III title, was second with 23 first-place votes and 120 points. North Babylon (10-2) was third with 21 points.
The announcement was made at the Suffolk County Football Coaches Association dinner in Hauppauge after a vote by the county's coaches.
Lindenhurst, which also won the Rutgers Trophy in 1962 and 1963, defeated Oceanside, 40-23, in the Long Island Class I championship game on Nov. 26 at Stony Brook's LaValle Stadium. It was the Bulldogs' first title in the 26-year history of the Long Island Championships.
Lindenhurst entered the season as the No. 2 seed behind Floyd but beat the Colonials twice. After a 21-7 win at Floyd in Week 6, Lindenhurst defeated the Colonials in the Suffolk I final, 35-12, to reach the Long Island Championships for the second time.
In an exciting Long Island Class I championship game, Lindenhurst scored 10 points in the fourth quarter to pull away from the Sailors. Jeremy Ruckert, the Ohio State-bound wide receiver, had five catches for 110 yards and a touchdown, kicked two field goals and four PATs, and made the key play of the game when he blocked a field goal and returned it 61 yards to set up a touchdown.
Quarterback Nick Anzalone, who completed 83 percent of his passes this season, completed 14 of 20 passes for 252 yards and three touchdowns against Oceanside.
"We made a lot of school history," he said. "It was awesome."

Full text: NEWSDAY SWIMMER OF THE YEAR
CHLOE STEPANEK
Northport, Soph.
It was a record-breaking season for Chloe Stepanek.
Competing for the combined Commack/Northport team, she won state titles in the 100-yard (49.93) and 200-yard freestyles (1:47.63), lowering her own Suffolk records. She also won the 500-yard freestyle at the Suffolk championships (5:01.53), which was also a county record.
"What separates Chloe from her competition is her ability to focus and execute her plan," Northport/Commack coach Drew Modrov said. "At the state meet she knew exactly what needed to be done and executed it. She handled everything like a professional would and it's rare to find that in a high school swimmer."
NASSAU SWIMMER OF THE YEAR

JOAN CASH
Sacred Heart, Fr.
Cash was an integral part of the Spartans' winning 400-free relay team (3:32.25) and their third-place 200-free relay team at the state championship meet. Cash also finished third in the 50-free (23.68) and fourth in the 100-free (51.51).
CATHERINE STANFORD
Oceanside, Soph.
Stanford was fourth in the 50-yard freestyle (23.84) and fifth in the 100-free (51.66) at the state championships after winning the Nassau crown in both events.

New rule allows girls lacrosse helmets - but many don't wear them: Debate remains on whether headgear makes game safer or more violent Many players find them uncomfortable or don't like how they look

Full text: Girls lacrosse players on Long Island have the option for the first time this spring to wear standardized lacrosse-specific helmets after years of debate over whether helmets will make the game safer or lead to a more violent style of play.
For Long Island high schools, the decision to make the helmets optional has created a new controversy. Most high schools are leaving the decision to buy and wear helmets up to the players. Other schools are buying the helmets and letting the players decide if they want to wear them. At least seven high schools are making the helmets mandatory.
A handful of games have been played this season, and most players are choosing not to wear the helmets. Coaches and school administrators say it's because the players find them uncomfortable and don't like the way they look. Today's high school players also have grown up playing without them and don't see the need to start wearing them now, officials say.
"You're talking about a culture change," Mount Sinai High School coach Al Bertolone said. "We have some kids that like them, some kids that hate them, a lot of kids on the fence in between."
Girls lacrosse, with more than 4,400 players on 200 varsity and junior varsity teams on Long Island, features players swinging sticks that have small netted baskets on their ends to shoot a hard rubber ball past a goaltender into a net.
"I like the game as it is, but the more I coach it, the more I see head hits than ever before," Bertolone said. "You say to yourself that the game is supposed to prevent that, but right now it's not happening. It's already become a more physical game, more physical than a traditionalist would have wanted it."
The girls game has long resisted helmets over the fear that it will become more like boys lacrosse, where physical contact - both players and sticks - is an integral part of the action. The girls' game does not allow any intentional contact and is considered, in theory, to be a noncontact sport. But the reality is players can get hit in the head with the ball or another player's stick.
As more becomes known about the damaging effects of head injuries and concussions, there has been a greater focus on the equipment that might help reduce the risk of injury.
"If I had a daughter and she played lacrosse," Comsewogue athletic director Matt DeVincenzo said, "I would want her to wear it."
West Islip coach Joe Nicolosi has another view.
"I'm not a big proponent of it for a couple of reasons," Nicolosi said. "I feel like it will make the games more aggressive. With girls wearing headgear, I feel like the girls are going to be more influenced to maybe swing their sticks because they feel like the girls are more protected. If I'm guarding someone wearing a helmet, maybe I'll take a shot at them. If I hit their head it's no big deal."
There were 65 suspected concussions among 4,431 girls lacrosse players on Long Island last season, or one per 68 players. Girls were more likely to suffer concussions in soccer (one per 41 players) and basketball (one per 54 players) than lacrosse. There were 71 suspected concussions among 5,763 boys lacrosse players, or one per 81 players.
Newsday compiled the concussion figures by obtaining incident reports from more than 100 schools via Freedom of Information Law requests and sport-specific participation figures obtained from New York State Public High School Athletic Association, the state's governing body for public school sports.
Two styles of soft helmets approved
U.S. Lacrosse, the sport's national governing body, announced its decision to make helmets optional for all levels of girls lacrosse - from youth leagues to college - in August. On the high school level, it is up to each state's athletic association to adopt the rules. Every state is allowing the new rule except Florida, which already had rules about mandatory headgear.
U.S. Lacrosse said its decision was based on six years of research, including whether to introduce hard-shell helmets like the ones boys wear into the girls game. Ultimately officials decided on a defined standard for soft helmets, which, manufacturers say, won't injure a helmetless player in an accidental collision.
The two styles of helmets approved for use by U.S. Lacrosse resemble bicycle or hockey helmets in appearance but differ because the material that makes up the shell is more flexible to the touch. The Cascade helmet, which costs $149.99, has a steel face mask that covers the player's eyes. The Hummingbird, which costs $139, fits around the goggles players normally wear.
Manufacturers must prove that the headgear can withstand a 60-mph impact from the ball. U.S. Lacrosse says that number was chosen, based on its studies, "to replicate impacts at the high-end of what is seen on the field." The helmets also must pass a deformity test to prove its flexibility upon impact.
Nicolosi said offensive players wearing helmets "will go harder and stronger" to the goal because they won't worry about possibly running into defenders or sticks.
"This is simply a very silly argument," said Dawn Comstock, a University of Colorado professor who studies high school sports injuries. "Helmets protect kids - period. Any unintended consequence associated with increased recklessness, as highly unlikely as I believe it would be, would be a problem of poor parenting, coaching and officiating rather than something that can be attributed to the helmet."
Introducing helmets into the game is such a point of contention that some people refuse to call the equipment a helmet. The preferred term is headgear.
"We feel the word helmet is inaccurate and gives the player and parent the wrong impression," said Todd Nelson, NYSPHSAA assistant director.
U.S. Lacrosse doesn't care what people call them.
"You can call it helmet, you can call it headgear, it doesn't matter," said Ann Kitt Carpenetti, U.S. Lacrosse vice president of lacrosse operations, who played at Oceanside High School. "At the end of the day if it is covering the whole head, it's essentially a helmet.
"The debate is over," Carpenetti said. "Wear it or not. It's your choice."
Different rules for boys and girls
In girls lacrosse, only the goalies are allowed to wear hard-shell, full-cage lacrosse helmets like the ones boys use. Girls are required only to wear goggles and a mouthpiece.
Boys lacrosse is more physical, with stick-to-body contact being an integral part of the game. Boys must wear a hard-shell helmet with a face guard, protective gloves and elbow and shoulder pads. Girls do not use protective pads with the exception of the goalies.
Both sports are played with the same solid rubber ball, which weighs between 5 and 5.25 ounces. In the boys game, players can shoot at any time. Girls are only allowed to shoot when the pathway to the goal is clear to protect players from getting hit by the ball.
Comstock said research shows that concussions were the most common girls lacrosse injury last school year nationwide, accounting for 34.5 percent of injuries.
Girls lacrosse players "would definitely sustain fewer head injuries, including concussions, if they were allowed to wear the same type of helmets" that the boys wear, Comstock said. She said it will take time to figure out whether the new soft helmet will have a similar effect on head injuries.
"Neither I nor anyone else yet knows if this new helmet girls are allowed to wear will be effective in reducing injuries or not," she said. "We will have to wait until surveillance data is in to answer that question."
The concussions occur most frequently because of contact from the ball or stick to the head, according to Comstock's annual report that culls injury data from a group of 100 schools nationwide. Concussion was followed by ankle sprain (19 percent) and by knee sprain (11.5 percent).
"Every time someone gets hurt, everyone on the sidelines says, 'I don't know why they don't make the girls wear helmets,' " said Jeanmarie Volkmann, whose daughter Paige is a senior on the Center Moriches team.
Volkmann said that when Paige, who is committed to playing lacrosse at Binghamton University next year, first saw the helmets, she said, "I'm not going to wear that."
"She's a typical lacrosse player," the mother said. "She has hair down to her fanny. It goes up into the messy bun on her head and the cool headband. It's the whole lacrosse girl look. And we're kind of messing with that now."
Center Moriches is among the schools that decided to make the helmets mandatory.
"We've all seen plenty of head injuries out there," Volkmann said. "I think in that regard she realizes it's a good thing. . . . I haven't seen any harder hits than before, so I don't think the game has changed at all."
On the college level, there are no players wearing helmets at either of Long Island's Division I schools - Stony Brook and Hofstra universities - according to school representatives.
"I don't like the idea of helmets," Stony Brook coach Joe Spallina said. "I feel with no helmets there is a mutual respect between players to be safety conscious."
Hofstra coach Shannon Smith said helmets provide an extra layer of safety in a game that she says is played at a faster speed than ever before.
"The game has evolved," Smith said. "It's become quicker. It's become faster. People can shoot from further out now. I think the headgear will make the game safer because the game has evolved."
To wear or not to wear
Nina Van Erk, the executive director of Nassau County high schools sports, said there was a lot of discussion among superintendents and school officials about the new helmet rule leading up to the season. She said she does not expect the majority of players to wear the helmets, at least not right away.
"I think a few teams will wear the headgear," Van Erk said. "The majority of schools will not."
Van Erk said it will become more common in a few years as younger players who are accustomed to wearing headgear reach the high school level.
In January, the Freeport school district spent $9,356 on 90 Cascade helmets, enough to outfit its entire high school and middle school programs.
"My feeling is the kids might complain a little bit, but no parent is going to complain," athletic director Jonathan Bloom said.
DeVincenzo, the Comsewogue athletic director, said his school board has been asking about helmets in girls lacrosse for years. He said that when the board was presented with buying helmets this year, "They said immediately yes, go get them."
DeVincenzo said the district spent $7,552 on 80 Cascade helmets.
"I don't think the girls are crazy about them," DeVincenzo said, "because they're a little uncomfortable from what I've heard. But like anything else, in time they'll get used to them. I haven't had any parent say, 'How come they're wearing them?' "
The Hempstead district spent $5,700 on 50 of the Hummingbird models in January. Athletic director Bob Cincotta said the district felt a responsibility to purchase the optional equipment because many families might not be able to afford to do so themselves.
"If you're asking a kid in Cold Spring Harbor, Jericho or Syosset to spend $149 on a helmet, that's different," he said. "Here, if we don't provide the product for the kid, the kids don't get them."
Some schools purchased helmets and are leaving the decision to wear them up to the players. The Great Neck district, which includes two high schools, spent $17,400 on 160 helmets, enough to outfit everyone on its varsity, junior varsity and middle school teams. Coaches said only one high school player is choosing to wear a helmet.
Smithtown chose to mandate helmets at its two high schools before the start of the season, citing safety concerns. But athletic director Pat Smith agreed to loosen the policy this week after Smithtown East coach Ann Naughton called him to say players were struggling to get used to the helmets.
"I'm open-minded to anything that happens here," Smith said, "because this is all evolving so quickly."
Most schools are taking a wait-and-see approach.
"If it becomes a mandated piece of equipment," Manhasset athletic director Jim Amen said, "then we will go out and buy all of the headgear for our players."
'They're growing on me'
Haley Dillon, a senior at Mount Sinai, said she has suffered three concussions - two playing lacrosse last season and the other playing soccer as a sophomore.
Haley was hit in the head by an errant shot last season. She said she had headaches but didn't report her symptoms.
"I figured I was probably sick or something," she said, "and I didn't want to say something just in case, because that would mean I would have been shut down."
In the next game a few days later, she was struck in the head by another player's stick. She said she instantly felt dizzy and left the game. She was diagnosed with a concussion and missed nearly two weeks.
Still, Haley doesn't want to wear the helmet.
"It hurts your temples and you have blind spots," Haley said. "I think if you give them to the younger kids, they could get used to them as they get older. But it's tough for seniors or varsity players who have been playing with goggles their whole life to start wearing these now."
Haley's mother, Tricia Dillon, wants her to wear the helmet.
"I really want them all to wear it," Tricia Dillon said. "I've been saying to my daughter and her friends: 'Wear them, wear them, wear them. Start a trend.' Because if we have enough girls wearing them, other girls will say, 'That's cool,' and they'll start, too."
Bertolone, Haley's coach, who also is on board, says of Haley, "She has been wearing it in practice, scrimmages and we are now working on games."
"Coaches like to say their girls don't get hit in the head," Bertolone said. "I'm not afraid to say my girls get hit in the head. I'm not one to rock the boat. I don't tell people what to do. But I do want them to be safer."
The girls admitted to coming around, albeit slowly.
"I didn't like them at first," senior Leah Nonnenmann said. "They're growing on me."
Senior Julia Markey added, "It's obviously something that takes some getting used to. I think it's good because I think it's a lot safer. I know as a defender people get checked in the head a lot."
Asked for a reason not to wear the helmets, Markey thought for a few seconds. "I don't think there's any reason not to wear them," she said.

Full text: An Oceanside man faces drug charges after driving on the Northern State Parkway Tuesday without tires on the passenger side of his BMW, State Police said.
Richard Rider, 31, was charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs, criminal possession of a controlled substance, criminal use of drug paraphernalia, possession of a hypodermic instrument, controlled substances not in original container, and traffic violations, police said Wednesday.
Shortly before 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, a trooper from the Farmingdale barracks saw the BMW going eastbound on the Northern State near the Wantagh State Parkway in Westbury, according to a news release.
"The operator of the BMW was driving without tires on the passenger side of the vehicle and was swerving across the lanes of traffic without using turning signals," the release said.
After initiating a traffic stop and while approaching the BMW, the trooper saw Rider place "contraband" inside the glove compartment, police said. The release added that Rider showed "obvious signs of impairment" and was arrested.
A search of the BMW yielded narcotic prescription pills, envelopes containing heroin, a hypodermic needle, and a scale, the release said.
His arraignment information was not immediately available.

Town to appoint special prosecutor in code officer case

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Hempstead Town deputy attorney said in court Thursday that the town is appointing a special prosecutor to take over a case against a municipal code enforcement officer who allegedly let debris pile up outside his Oceanside home.
Deputy Town Attorney Brad Regenbogen said during an appearance in District Court in Hempstead that the town is working to appoint a special prosecutor in the case against Roy Gunther Jr.
Regenbogen did not say why the town is seeking a new prosector during his brief remarks in front of Judge Paul Meli. Gunther and his attorney, Michael Elbaz of Manhattan, declined to comment Thursday after the court appearance.
The appointment of a special prosecutor is to "avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest," town spokesman Mike Deery said. The town will hire an outside private attorney to handle the case, he said.
The case has been adjourned until Sept. 19.
Gunther was charged in May with a violation after he allegedly let garbage and construction debris pile up at his home during renovations to repair superstorm Sandy damage from 2012.
An "on-site field inspection" at his Riverside Drive home by a co-worker found "brick piles, milk crates, a sink, a toilet bowl, and varying garbage and construction debris stored on the property at the exterior of the dwelling," court documents state.
Gunther received two other summonses for not having a permit to disconnect a gas meter, but the charges were dropped because the building inspector wrote the wrong date on the ticket, Deery said last month.
Deery said a contractor, James Marinello Construction Co. Inc. of Merrick, left the debris there after working to raise Gunther's home, but charges are always filed against the property's owner, not the contractor.
On Wednesday, James Marinello said his company has not worked at the home since November, and added that his employees only did framing for the house, not the demolition.
Gunther is not believed to have been living at the home at the time and may not have been aware of the violations, Deery said. The debris was cleaned up soon after the summons was issued. Fines for the violation could reach $500 but are set at the court's discretion.
Gunther has worked for the town since 1999 and is listed as a "code enforcement officer III" in the building department at an annual salary of $125,333, according to 2016 town payroll records.
Daniel Russo, a Garden City attorney who is chairman of the Nassau County Bar Association's Criminal Law and Procedure Committee, said the town's appointment of a special prosecutor at the beginning of the case avoids any potential future allegations of impropriety.
"It levels the playing field before anyone can ask questions," he said.
If Gunther got a different outcome in his case than "a Mr. Jones who was cited for the same thing, Mr. Jones would say, 'Well, that guy got a better deal than I did because he works for the town,' " Russo said.
The special prosecutor is supposed to have "full rein" in litigating the case, he said.
"The town is completely hands-off," Russo said. "They will have absolutely no say in how the case is resolved."

Jack Rosen's pin sparks Dalers to wrestling win

Author: Boell, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]07 Jan 2017.

Abstract: Rosen could only recall one other occasion in his four-year varsity career when he opened a match.

Full text:   Jack Rosen usually has anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to prepare for his wrestling matches at 195 pounds.
But the Farmingdale senior got some unexpected news from coach Artie Weidler just before the Dalers match against Oceanside last night.
"He told me, 'We're starting in two minutes, and we're beginning at 195 (pounds)," Rosen said.
It's usually the waiting game for the heavier weights in wrestling, but the 195-pound weight class was picked first to begin the match.
"I wanted to work for the pin and get us six early points," Rosen said. "I was hoping everyone else would follow."
Indeed they did. The host Dalers rattled off three straight pins - led by Rosen - and defeated Oceanside, 69-12, in Nassau I-B.
Rosen could only recall one other occasion in his four-year varsity career when he opened a match.
"It's definitely a lot better to go first than to wait to face an opponent," Rosen said. "It was exciting because we had a packed house."
After Rosen's pin in three minutes, Josh DeSousa (220) and Ryan Charleston (285) also recorded pins as Farmingdale (2-0) led 18-0. Joseph Simons (120), Jalees Briggs (152) and Darrin Simons (182) also registered pins for the Dalers. Tyler Sullivan (138) earned a hard-fought, 4-2, decision over John Cannella in the match of the night, according to Weidler.
"We didn't let up, and we didn't make any mistakes," said Weidler, in his first season as head coach. "We wrestle as hard as we can, and as long as we wrestle our best, whatever happens, happens."

South Nassau Communities Hospital deemed Level II trauma center

Author: Lam, Chau

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 July 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1805206140?accountid=37869

Abstract: The center is staffed with a trauma team that, for the first time, includes an on-site surgeon 24 hours a day to care for patients involved in motor vehicle crashes, falls, drownings, fires and burns and violence such as gunshot wounds.

Full text:   After years of preparations and a $2 million investment, South Nassau Communities Hospital has been certified as a Level II trauma center, allowing the Oceanside medical facility to continue treating life-threatening and disabling injuries.
The center is staffed with a trauma team that, for the first time, includes an on-site surgeon 24 hours a day to care for patients involved in motor vehicle crashes, falls, drownings, fires and burns and violence such as gunshot wounds.
"Having a surgeon here around the clock, who is employed by the hospital, has made tremendous improvement in the response time," said Richard J. Murphy, the hospital's president and chief executive officer. "That trauma surgeon is in the ED when the ambulance arrives."
South Nassau Communities Hospital - which serves about 900,000 residents - is the only medical facility on Nassau County's South Shore that has received the approval of the American College of Surgeons, the Chicago-based accrediting body, according to a list on the group's website.
Up until September 2012, the state Department of Health was responsible for designating trauma centers. At that time, the state moved toward a national verification system overseen by the American College of Surgeons, whose verification process is more rigorous, hospital officials said. The accreditation, awarded this month, is good for three years.
Other requirements demanded by the accrediting body include having a supply of certain blood products, such as platelets, on hand, and dedicating an operating room for trauma cases.
Trauma centers are ranked I to IV, based on their resources and level of care.
Three hospitals on Long Island are classified by the surgeons group as Level I trauma centers: Northwell Health system in Manhasset, Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola and Stony Brook University Hospital. Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow is undergoing the review process.
Last year, the Emergency Department at South Nassau Communities Hospital recorded about 60,000 visits, and of those, 1,338 were classified as trauma cases, said hospital spokesman Joe Calderone. Forty-four percent of trauma cases resulted from falls, mostly in the older adult population. The second largest volume of trauma cases, 17 percent, resulted from vehicular crashes.
"We have more capabilities to treat those patients more effectively," said Dr. Joshua Kugler, chairman of South Nassau Communities Hospital's Emergency Medicine Department. "We have better outcomes. We are saving more lives."

Sandy repairs progressing, but much work still ahead, LIRR says

Author: Castillo, Alfonso A

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]02 Nov 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1834749210?accountid=37869

Abstract: The railroad's post-Sandy improvement efforts have been focused on the four areas hit hardest by the October 2012 storm - rail yards in Long Island City and on Manhattan's West Side, the East River Tunnels leading into and out of Penn Station, and the Long Beach branch, which residents and officials say may never fully be out of harm's way.

Full text:   The Long Island Rail Road is making progress on repairing, rebuilding and hardening its system devastated four years ago by superstorm Sandy, officials said.
However, they say some projects are still years from completion, including several along the LIRR's vulnerable Long Beach branch.
The railroad's post-Sandy improvement efforts have been focused on the four areas hit hardest by the October 2012 storm - rail yards in Long Island City and on Manhattan's West Side, the East River Tunnels leading into and out of Penn Station, and the Long Beach branch, which residents and officials say may never fully be out of harm's way.
"When Superstorm Sandy roared across the New York/Long Island region . . . the effects were devastating, but preparation paid off," said LIRR spokesman Salvatore Arena, adding that the railroad's pre-emptive shutdown before the worst of the storm allowed it to move trains to higher ground to protect them. "However, although LIRR personnel planned carefully for Superstorm Sandy, there was substantial damage to the infrastructure due to greater-than-expected storm surge."
Some efforts have already made considerable progress.
New electrical substations - elevated to protect them from flooding - have already been installed in Long Island City, near the East Rockaway station and in the Oil City section of Oceanside. A contractor has finished 13 of 15 new elevated platforms, which will protect new signal and communication huts from flooding.
Improvements to the Wreck Lead Bridge, which carries the LIRR over Reynolds Channel, are well underway and expected to be finished by April. The bridge has already gotten a new emergency generator, walkway lighting, high-tension poles and other electrical equipment.
Other improvements, however, are far from being finished.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board on Friday awarded a $2.4 million contract for new signal equipment for the Long Beach line - part of a broader effort to replace signal, switch, communications and third rail equipment along the line that isn't expected to be completed before September 2019.
"There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. But then again, a lot of work has been done," said John Molloy, the Nassau County representative on the MTA Board. "I think the MTA has done nice work moving this thing along . . . You just can't do it overnight. It's a lot of work, and a lot of pieces that have to be put together. "
Nowhere did the LIRR's system get hit harder by Sandy than on the Long Beach line, where tracks and delicate electrical components were submerged under 4 feet of corrosive saltwater and sewage, three electrical substations were damaged, and nearly two dozen boats and personal watercraft washed up on tracks.
It took nearly a month for the LIRR to restore full service on the line, used by more than 20,000 riders each weekday.
"It was very difficult. We were the last It's highly insulting, but what can you do about that?" said Island Park Mayor Michael McGinty, who commended the LIRR for its work modernizing electrical substations on the line, but said the agency hasn't done enough to seek input from local government on the problems facing local commuters, including over drainage. "The line is very important to the residents of Island Park, as well as Long Beach, Lido Beach, Point Lookout and, believe it or not, some from Oceanside."
Fran Kravitz, who commutes from Island Park for acting classes and jobs in Manhattan, recalls her husband having to move into Manhattan for weeks after Sandy because of the service problems on the Long Beach line.
Four years later, Kravitz, 56, said the branch remains particularly susceptible to flooding.
"If we get a storm on a full moon in high tide, those train tracks are under water . . . The tracks are still on the ground, so it's still going to flood, just like the rest of Island Park."
William Henderson, executive director of the MTA's Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, which includes the LIRR Commuter Council, said although the MTA has done substantial work to repair and fortify its system over the last four years, the work may never be fully done, in part because it will have to keep up with rising sea levels and other major weather events.
"I think they're going to be doing hardening for years - probably for our lifetime," said Henderson, who singled out the Long Beach line as a particular challenge. "At the end of the day, you've got tracks that are going over and basically next to water. If there's a storm that comes up and across the water, there's going to be impacts."
Other flood-prone parts of the LIRR's territory are also in line for improvements. The LIRR is putting $100 million in Federal Transportation Administration grant funding toward several planned projects to fortify its West Side Yard, the Queens portals of the East River Tunnels, and the tunnels themselves. Those efforts are in their early stages, with the MTA currently working out cost estimates, officials said.
The LIRR has also begun flood-protection work on its Atlantic Avenue tunnels along its Brooklyn line and at the Long Island City yard.
The Federal Transportation Administration also in June awarded the MTA $432 million to make critical repairs inside the East River Tunnels, which were badly damaged by corrosive saltwater from Sandy flooding. Amtrak, which owns the tunnels and is responsible for the repairs, has said the work won't begin until the end of this decade, and take several years to complete.

SPCA investigating 'disturbing' video of man shoving pole at dog

Abstract: The Nassau County SPCA is looking into a widely shared video that allegedly shows a person at a dog-training facility aggressively shoving a pole into an animal crate.

Full text:   The Nassau County SPCA is looking into a widely shared video that allegedly shows a person at a dog-training facility aggressively shoving a pole into an animal crate.
The video, posted late Friday night, shows a man shoving the pole repeatedly into the crate as the dog inside cowers and yelps.
The SPCA said it believes the video took place at a Nassau County board-away dog training facility.
"We are aware of it and we are looking into it at this time," SPCA head Gary Rogers said. "At face value, the video is very disturbing."
The video originated in a private Oceanside-based Facebook group for crime prevention, but group administrator Tommy Marrone, who previously boarded his German shepherd at the facility, later shared the clip to his own profile. It racked up more than 60,000 views as of Saturday evening and more than 2,800 shares.
Multiple attempts to reach the owner of the dog training facility on Saturday were unsuccessful.
Marrone, 43, of Oceanside said he and his wife sent their German shepherd Zeus to the facility for two weeks of training in June and found the video disturbing. The clip raised questions for the family.
Lauren Marrone, 32, said she didn't know whether her dog was harmed during his stay at the facility.
"It's unnerving," she said.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
State authorities have received information alleging that the medical record of a Nassau County jail inmate was tampered with in an attempted cover-up of health care decisions made before his heart attack and May death, according to sources with knowledge of the case.
Investigators were told a note was allegedly removed from the jail medical chart of Antonio Marinaccio Jr., 53, of Levittown after his collapse and before his death after days on life support, sources said.
Marinaccio's jail health record was further falsified, according to the allegations, to say a medical test had been ordered before his heart attack in jail.
The information has emerged after a year in which the jail's private medical contractor, Armor Correctional Health Services, was the subject of scathing state Commission of Correction reports on inmate deaths, civil litigation in New York and elsewhere, and calls for the company's county contract to be suspended.
Armor's practices at the jail also are the target of an investigation by State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman's office, which Newsday first reported in October. Armor has since received subpoenas in connection with that probe, according to a separate source with knowledge of the investigation.
The state commission, which investigates all inmate deaths, is looking into Marinaccio's death.
Nassau County Attorney Carnell Foskey said in a statement in response to the allegations regarding Marinaccio's jail medical record that the county doesn't comment on pending litigation. He said a question about subpoenas "should be directed to Armor."
The Marinaccio family's attorney, Harry Demiris Jr., said he believes Armor is trying to cover up its actions.
"I've learned from what I deem a credible source that the record was doctored," Demiris told Newsday in an exclusive interview.
He and another person familiar with the case said the potentially incriminating information involving the documents was given to authorities.
Demiris and Marinaccio's family have said he brought records with him to the jail showing he had heart abnormalities and herniated disks and needed substance abuse detox.
The attorney and another source with knowledge of the case said the note that allegedly disappeared from Marinaccio's jail medical record said the inmate had a substance abuse history and had gone on an alcohol and drug binge right before going to jail, but a jail doctor didn't want an EKG performed and didn't want Marinaccio sent to the facility's infirmary.
After the inmate's hospitalization, that note went missing, and Marinaccio's chart also was falsified to say that a chest X-ray had been ordered, Demiris and another source with knowledge of the case said of the allegations.
Armor defends its standard
Armor said, in response, it "has EKG machines in every facility and this test is administered by nurses to those requiring it."
"There is no incentive for us to withhold such a test which is administered in-house as dictated by the needs of our patients on a consistent and routine basis," the company added.
Armor, which has repeatedly defended its standard of care in the past year, also said in a statement that a privacy law prohibits the company from commenting specifically on any inmate's case.
"With respect to the allegation, this is another example of media manipulation by those with their own agenda such as plaintiff attorneys, disgruntled former employees, or organized labor unions," the company also said. "Further, the company provides multiple sources where a sincere concerned employee can communicate such concerns anonymously. There were no such communications."
Care found to be inadequate
The attorney general's probe is said to include looking at allegations of poor patient treatment, along with how Armor handles medical emergencies. The investigation began as the Miami-based company, which reports providing health care to about 40,000 inmates in eight states, repeatedly came under fire in 2015 from the Commission of Correction.
The commission declined to comment on Marinaccio's case.
"We wouldn't comment prior to its conclusion," spokeswoman Janine Kava said of the probe. "If the commission comes across any information that should be referred to another entity . . . including a law enforcement agency, those referrals would be made."
The state attorney general's office declined to comment.
The commission, which has oversight of the state's jails, found in September that Armor has engaged in a broad pattern of negligent medical care and questioned the company's ability to provide sufficient inmate health care.
The agency also found then that the 2014 jail custody deaths of Nassau inmates John Gleeson, 40, of Oceanside, and Kevin Brown, 47, of Far Rockaway, may have been prevented and that both got deficient care from Armor.
The commission's findings marked at least the fourth time the agency found Armor's care inadequate in Nassau inmate fatalities since the county first inked a two-year, $11 million-a-year public-private partnership with the vendor in mid-2011 in an attempt to cut costs. County Executive Edward Mangano, a Republican, has put the savings at $7 million a year.
In June, the county legislature's Republican-led Rules Committee extended Armor's contract for another two years. That happened despite questions from Democrats who pointed to concerns about poor inmate medical care from a former bar association president, a judge and the New York Civil Liberties Union, which Newsday reported in May.
Directed to do inquiry
In its September findings, the commission also directed county legislators to do an inquiry into Armor's fitness to provide inmate health services in the Nassau jail. The commission said lawmakers should specifically look at Armor's pattern of failing to properly manage patients' chronic medical needs, maintain proper and organized patient records and provide needed hospitalization for patients.
In October, Sheriff Michael Sposato refused to answer a Democratic legislator's questions about Armor during a public budget hearing, days after the commission's September findings about the jail medical contractor became public.
A spokesman for Sposato has said amid criticism of Armor that the jail medical contract - previously held by Nassau University Medical Center - has enhanced overall public safety since a greater number of inmate health services are provided in-house. The East Meadow hospital is down the block from the jail.
In the wake of the commission's findings, Mangano's administration also rejected a call from inmate advocates and county Legislative Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport) to suspend Armor's contract.
While Mangano referred the findings to Foskey's office, Foskey later issued a statement saying Armor's contract couldn't be canceled "without subjecting taxpayers to significant liability as the allegations have not been substantiated to date."
Family's plans to sue
In the meantime, Marinaccio's family is moving forward with plans to sue the county and Armor.
Demiris filed a notice of claim in July on behalf of Marinaccio's family, citing the county, the jail and correction officials among parties responsible for the man's wrongful death. The family has claimed Marinaccio became brain dead after not getting proper medical care and suffering the heart attack in jail custody.
Their notice of claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, also alleged officials at the jail failed "to employ appropriate care and resuscitation efforts" while the inmate was "totally reliant upon his warders."
Marinaccio's collapse came two days after he surrendered on April 24 to serve a 1-year sentence after pleading guilty to charges including felony DWI and resisting arrest.
On April 26, a sheriff's department official called Marinaccio's family and said he'd been found in his cell at 3 a.m. in cardiac arrest, before he was brought to Nassau University Medical Center and then transferred to North Shore University Hospital, relatives have said.
Marinaccio's family said he died May 2 after they gave permission to turn off life support after tests showed he was brain dead.
But the family also has said they learned Marinaccio wasn't brought to the first hospital until 4:18 a.m., what Demiris previously called "a significant delay."
The family also had alleged in August that law enforcement officials beat Marinaccio while he was in custody. In contrast, the head of Nassau's union for correction officers has said officers were actually the first people to give emergency first aid to Marinaccio.
Legal action from Marinaccio's family comes as the county and Armor also are embroiled in a federal wrongful death lawsuit filed in November by the family of Gleeson. The father of two died after allegedly not getting proper treatment for a medical condition in which swelling episodes can lead to breathing emergencies.
The family of Brown, a former car service dispatcher who suffered seizures and whom the commission found got inadequate medical and mental health care before his custody death, also is planning litigation.
Meanwhile, a federal lawsuit from the family of Bartholomew Ryan, 32, who served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq before hanging himself at the jail in 2012 in a case where the commission found Armor's care inadequate, also is ongoing.
How the story developed
- May: Concerns about inmate medical care at Nassau's jail become public, but a sheriff's department official says the county intends to keep health care vendor Armor Correctional Health Services.
- June: The county legislature's Republican-led Rules Committee extends Armor's contract for two years.
- July: Inmate Antonio Marinaccio Jr.'s family starts litigation after his May death after a heart attack in the jail that led to days on life support.
- August: Family of John Gleeson, who died in jail custody in 2014 and had a condition called angioedema, says his pleas for more medical help were ignored.
- September: State commission finds Armor engaged in a pattern of negligent medical care and the 2014 deaths of Gleeson and inmate Kevin Brown may have been prevented. Orders Nassau legislature to conduct Armor inquiry. Calls soon come for county to suspend Armor's contract.
- October: State attorney general opens probe into Armor's practices. Nassau sheriff refuses to answer questions about Armor during budget hearing.
- November: County Executive Edward Mangano's administration reviews commission findings, but says Armor's contract can't be canceled "without subjecting taxpayers to significant liability."
- November: Gleeson family files federal lawsuit.

Behaviorist can help with dog's boundary issues

Author: Morrone, Marc

Abstract: (Just because the dog listens to such a person through fear does not mean that the feelings will be transferred to you when the trainer leaves.) Plus, it is never a good idea to use force or dominance on an animal that is stronger than you.

Full text:   Q: We have a 2-year-old collie shepherd mix who loves us, offers hugs and kisses and is loyal. But, when the dog and I are on the bed and my 20-year-old son enters the bedroom, the dog growls. Sometimes it's a bit scary. Last week he went too far. My wife and I were lying on the bed watching TV. The dog joined us with his head on her belly. When I got up to go to work, he growled his usual low growl. When I went to kiss my wife goodbye, he growled so close to her face that she thought he was going to bite her. The dog attended training successfully when he was 6 months old, never had a problem with company, and gets along well with the cat. Neighbors love to see us walk down the block while he holds his leash in his mouth. Do you think he just hates to see me leave or see my son enter the bedroom when it is our time?
A: Have a dog behaviorist who uses positive reinforcement methods work closely with this dog. He is just too big to take any chances with. He obviously has some issues with boundaries.
If you no longer allow him on your bed, that issue would be gone. However, the main problem is in the way he is thinking. By using positive reinforcement, the behaviorist is teaching the dog that if he obeys, something better will happen, such as a food reward.
It is important not to use a trainer who uses dominance or force in such a situation. (Just because the dog listens to such a person through fear does not mean that the feelings will be transferred to you when the trainer leaves.) Plus, it is never a good idea to use force or dominance on an animal that is stronger than you. When used correctly, the proper behaviorist -- not a trainer -- will be able to tighten up whatever screws are loose in his head.
Q: When we moved into our home it had a 4-foot-high chain link fence around the backyard. After we moved in, we got a golden retriever puppy and thought we could allow her to run around free in the yard. However, as soon as she got big enough to get her front paws on top of the fence she realized that she could climb over it -- and away she went. So we replaced the 4-foot fence with a 6-foot fence. She climbs up it like a squirrel and is over it in a flash. We cannot put up a higher fence due to zoning and we do not want to put up a smooth white plastic fence as our property borders the Oceanside nature preserve and we like the view. Apart from building a separate enclosure for her, is there anything we can do?
A: You can try putting a baffle of wire mesh on the top of the fence leaning inward into your yard to prevent her from going over it, but such a thing always looks messy. A better option is one of those radio fences. This is a wire that goes along the ground near the base of the fence that corresponds to a radio-controlled collar that your dog wears. The collar emits a mild corrective shock when she goes near the fence line. After a few months of wearing this, she most likely will get the idea that going near the fence is no longer an option and she will stop trying even when she is not wearing the collar. The problem will be solved.
Q: You advised a reader with an overweight dog to mix canned pumpkin in the dog food for weight loss. My cat eats canned food twice a day and we leave dry food down for her during the day. She is very fat. Can I mix the pumpkin in her food as you described for the dog?
A: As many cats enjoy canned pumpkin as dogs, but there is no need to do this. Just take up the dry food and give her as much canned food as she wants twice a day and she will lose weight easily. It is the texture of the dry food that cats like so much and they tend to eat more of it than what they need. When you first take the dry food away she will actually go through withdrawal and cry all the time, but in a few days she will get over it.

Long Beach's new ER gets high marks; most are treated, released: Survey found 6,710 patients seen in the new emergency room Patient satisfaction ranked in the top 94% of ERs nationwide

Abstract: South Nassau in October 2014 took over the bankrupt former Long Beach Medical Center, a 162-bed facility damaged in superstorm Sandy two years earlier, and replaced it with the free-standing emergency department at 325 East Bay Dr. The move sparked intense debate, led by the Beach to Bay Central Council of Civic Associations, with critics saying the barrier island, with its high percentage of aged and poor residents, is too isolated to be without a facility that has acute-care beds and operating rooms.

Full text:   South Nassau Communities Hospital's Long Beach Emergency Department has treated more than 6,710 patients over the past 10 months, with nearly 88 percent being treated and released without having to leave the barrier island, the hospital said Wednesday.
In addition, surveys conducted from October through December by an independent health-care consultant ranked the emergency department in the 94th percentile nationwide in overall patient satisfaction compared with other emergency departments, the hospital said. It has treated conditions from lacerations, broken bones and strep throat to strokes and heart attacks.
The hospital's statistics from the Long Beach Emergency Department's opening in August through the end of April show 87.8 percent of its patients were treated and released, while 8.7 percent were transferred to the main 455-bed hospital in Oceanside. About 85 percent of the Long Beach facility's patients arrived on their own - by car, public transportation or on foot - and 15 percent were brought by ambulance.
"The data show that local residents are increasingly depending on South Nassau's Emergency Department, have accepted it as the 'go to' facility for emergency care on the barrier island and are having an overwhelmingly favorable experience," Richard J. Murphy, president and CEO at South Nassau, said in a statement.
South Nassau in October 2014 took over the bankrupt former Long Beach Medical Center, a 162-bed facility damaged in superstorm Sandy two years earlier, and replaced it with the free-standing emergency department at 325 East Bay Dr.
The move sparked intense debate, led by the Beach to Bay Central Council of Civic Associations, with critics saying the barrier island, with its high percentage of aged and poor residents, is too isolated to be without a facility that has acute-care beds and operating rooms.
South Nassau, citing another consultant's report that a small hospital would not provide quality care or be financially sustainable, said it can meet local needs without one. It intends to replace the current emergency department with a medical arts pavilion offering a range of specialties, including dialysis, to be located on the site of the old hospital.
The civic group has objected that much of the $170 million in federal and state funds won to restore medical services to Long Beach would be spent on upgrading South Nassau's Oceanside hospital. Hospital officials, however, said Federal Emergency Management Agency rules permit expenditures as long as they benefit residents of Long Beach, and said more than a third of the total figure would stay in Long Beach.
"We'll probably have invested well over $70 million to acquire the Long Beach Medical Center, build the current emergency department, demolish the old buildings and build the new center," Murphy said. "We're dialoguing with that group and others to identify a long-term development plan. I think we've come a long way with that group."
Representatives of Beach to Bay, who met Wednesday to discuss the latest proposals from South Nassau, agreed that progress has occurred but are still pushing for an acute-care hospital.
"We're in talks with South Nassau and we're in agreement with several aspects of their proposal," said Barbara Bernardino, the civic association's president. She cited proposals to add a third floor to the medical arts pavilion, set to open in 2019, with the capability to add a fourth, and a willingness to consider making it a Level Three trauma center.
Dr. Martin Gruber, a retired orthopedic surgeon who is a Beach to Bay member, said the absence of a hospital in Long Beach has led to an loss of local medical practices. He said he isn't sure what can be expected from South Nassau.
"Their promises and statements have been vague, so I can't tell you what they are willing to consider," he said. "What we need is a Level Three trauma center, and we need a way to treat the high incidence of chronic disease on this island."
Dr. Joshua Kugler, chairman of emergency services for South Nassau, said medical practices will return to Long Beach as the medical center begins making referrals.
Murphy said primary care would be one of the main elements in the medical arts building, along with six dialysis stations, expanded radiology and a lab. A range of clinical sub-specialties, from adolescent health and obstetrics to cardiology, orthopedics and ambulatory surgery, are "on the drawing board for feasibility testing," he said.
"We have said from the very beginning, we're happy to develop clinical programs that are needed and financially sustainable," he said, noting the emphasis in medical care has been shifting from inpatient stays to ambulatory services that keep people out of the hospital.
South Nassau decided to release the patient statistics for the Long Beach Emergency Department to allay concerns over the care available on the barrier island in time for the higher demands in the summer months, officials said.
"We want people to be aware the facility is there," Murphy said. "We're seeing between 35 and 40 patients a day, and the expectation is that during summer that will surge to 50 to 60 a day."
Kugler said the objective is to provide the best care for Long Beach residents.
He said that the emergency room already is a major improvement in emergency care. "We've developed a unique and modern approach, a patient-centric approach, to health care delivery in that ER that heretofore did not exist. We can deliver diagnostic assessments at a faster rate than any other ER," including "a cardiac assessment in five to 10 minutes that would take an hour elsewhere."

Abstract: The suits - alleging inmates suffered and sometimes died because Armor Correctional Health Services' staff was negligent and underqualified, deprived inmates of medical care and denied emergency care - come as a New York State commission in September said the Miami-based firm gave "incompetent and deficient" care to a Nassau jail inmate who died in custody last year. Since May, Newsday has reported that critics, including attorneys, the New York Civil Liberties Union, and an acting state Supreme Court justice who lowered an inmate's bail after her lawyer said she hadn't gotten her diabetes medication, have raised concerns about Armor.

Full text:   The private company entrusted with providing health care to the Nassau County jail - and recently cited for giving inadequate care to inmates who died in custody - has a trail of lawsuits in multiple states alleging that it delivered substandard care.
The suits - alleging inmates suffered and sometimes died because Armor Correctional Health Services' staff was negligent and underqualified, deprived inmates of medical care and denied emergency care - come as a New York State commission in September said the Miami-based firm gave "incompetent and deficient" care to a Nassau jail inmate who died in custody last year.
Since May, Newsday has reported that critics, including attorneys, the New York Civil Liberties Union, and an acting state Supreme Court justice who lowered an inmate's bail after her lawyer said she hadn't gotten her diabetes medication, have raised concerns about Armor. Last month, advocates and one of Nassau's top Democrats intensified calls to suspend Armor's contract after the state findings about the death of inmate John Gleeson at the Nassau jail.
In addition, the New York State attorney general's office has launched an investigation of Armor's quality of care, including how the company deals with medical emergencies at the Nassau jail, sources told Newsday last week.
A review of complaints filed in federal and state courts naming Armor as a defendant, state Commission of Correction reports obtained through multiple public information requests, other documents and interviews with attorneys found:
The state commission said two inmates - Tommie Lee Jones, 51, and Daniel Pantera, 46, who died in custody at the Niagara County Jail, received "grossly inadequate" care. The agency said Pantera's death was "preventable" if he had received adequate treatment.
In Florida, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri ended the county's contract with Armor a little more than seven months into the two-year agreement. Among the issues, Gualtieri said Armor was not treating patients in a timely manner, the Tampa Bay Times reported.
Also in Florida, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office decided to no longer use Armor's services, ending a nine-year relationship. The decision came about a year after a $1 million payout to the family of a Tampa man who suffered a stroke in a jail where Armor provided health care and later died.
At a women's prison in Virginia, the state will pay for an independent monitor after inmates sued, alleging they had to stand in a "pill line" about 3 a.m. in the rain and snow to receive medicine at a facility where Armor was responsible for medical care.
Armor is among six to 10 large private correctional health care providers, said Dr. Marc Stern, a Washington state-based internist who does research on correctional health care and examines care in various facilities.
Experts say there are good and poor examples of privatized correctional health care. More government agencies appear to be choosing the privatization option, said Brenda E. Castaneda, a Virginia attorney who sued Armor and others, alleging substandard care.
The quality of care is determined more by the local health care administrators managing the private contract than the company itself and whether there is robust oversight by jail administrators, experts say. But regardless of who is providing health care, more emphasis needs to be put on improving correctional care, they say.
Stern, a former Washington State Department of Corrections assistant secretary of health care, said: "The root problem is we don't put enough money and attention into correctional health care. ... It's just not important to the public, unfortunately."
Reluctant to represent
Joanne Doroshow, founder and executive director of the Center for Justice & Democracy in New York, said lawyers are generally unwilling to take on medical malpractice lawsuits involving inmates because the damages are typically low and juries are usually unsympathetic.
In instances where attorneys take on such cases, "the harm is so egregious, it can rise to the level of a constitutional violation," she said.
Armor's contract has been renewed twice since Nassau legislators first agreed to a two-year contract for $11 million a year as a cost-cutting measure.
That deal privatized work that the Nassau University Medical Center previously handled for about $18 million in 2010. Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano has publicly said that the Armor contract has saved $7 million annually.
Records show Nassau County has paid Armor nearly $43 million since mid-2011.
Last year, Fort Lauderdale attorney Greg Lauer sued Armor, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel and others, alleging negligence in the death of Raleigh Priester, 52, a U.S. Army veteran with a history of schizophrenia, who died July 10, 2012, after 155 days in the Broward County Jail.
Armor declined to comment on specific lawsuits or patient-specific matters.
"Armor supports its caregivers who work relentlessly every day on behalf of our patients to fulfill our mission of providing quality care," spokeswoman Yeleny Suarez said in an email. She said the company has "seen a recent trend among certain attorneys attempting to manipulate the media."
The company has said that no jury has ever found it guilty of medical malpractice.
Armor, though, has recently settled at least two lawsuits involving inmate deaths that never made it before a jury.
In August, Priester's family settled its suit. The terms are confidential.
Fort Lauderdale police arrested Priester on Feb. 6, 2012, after he threw a rock at a city employee who asked him to leave a parking garage, according to the suit filed in federal court.
The suit alleged that Armor's staff had learned about Priester's medical history - including a stint in a mental hospital - and placed him in solitary confinement. He was seen standing naked, "yelling, incoherently, actively hallucinating, banging his head on the floor causing himself to bleed," the suit said.
'Slow horrible death'
Priester was denied adequate amounts of food and water and was not given medication or medical treatment while in solitary, nor was he moved to a facility for treatment, the suit said.
Priester died a "slow horrible death," the suit said. He was found dead in a cell, weighing only 120 pounds - about half what he weighed when he was admitted to the jail.
Lauer declined to comment on the suit.
In New York's Niagara County, Armor agreed to a $100,000 payout in July to settle a wrongful-death suit Jones' daughter filed.
"I think ... [the settlement] sends a message to the counties and to the jails, that proper care has to be rendered to the people that they are incarcerating," said Jones' attorney, Gregory Krull of Buffalo.
Jones was jailed on a parole violation Nov. 29, 2012. He had a history of heart disease, emphysema and gout, and told jail officials of his medical record.
Days before his death, Armor's medical director gave him medication that "should be used cautiously with patients with cardiovascular disease" and didn't follow up, the suit said.
Jones also submitted sick calls complaining that his leg was swollen and full of fluid, and gout had started to set in.
The day before he died, he told a nurse he felt like he was going to "have a heart attack," the report said.
Jones died Dec. 29, 2012 - two weeks after Armor took over medical care - of acute untreated pulmonary edema, a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe, the report said.
The report recommended that state health officials investigate Armor's medical director for "failing to examine and respond to a patient who demonstrated a need for immediate medical care" and for giving Jones improperly prescribed medicine.
Armor declined to comment on the report.
Founded in 2004, the company said it provides medical care to more than 40,000 inmates in eight states. Last October, it signed a five-year, $21.8 million contract with Osceola County, Florida, to provide care to roughly 824 inmates in the county jail - a deal that saves the county about $677,000, a county spokesman said.
Medical services are not the county's expertise, and the county is indemnified if a lawsuit is filed involving Armor's services, the spokesman said.
Suarez said Armor has grown because their clients see "a sincere effort and the results from our team to enhance patient care in a cost-effective manner."
In 2013, Armor paid $800,000 to settle with the family of Allen Hicks, 51, who died in August 2012 while in custody in Hillsborough County, Florida, court records show. Armor was not named in the suit against Hillsborough and other defendants.
The Hillsborough County sheriff's office paid $200,000, records show.
A Florida Highway patrol trooper had pulled Hicks over in May 2012 for driving erratically after the Tampa high school baseball coach was seen hitting the guardrail.
Paramedics instructed the highway patrol trooper to take Hicks to the hospital after he refused commands to get out of his vehicle, but authorities took Hicks to the Hillsborough County Jail, said his attorney, Paul Rebein of Tampa.
The left side of his body wasn't functioning and his leg dragged as he was placed in a cell where he lay face down on a mattress as Armor's nurses "stood by and watched," Rebein said.
Thirty-six hours passed before he slipped into a coma. He died about a month later.
"He's seen struggling to try to get up, clearly not using one side of his body and nobody's doing anything to help," Rebein said.
Rebein said Hicks' treatment amounts to "devaluing the life of someone who is a detainee."
In 2014, the Hillsborough County sheriff's office ended its relationship with Armor after its contract expired and awarded a new contract to Alabama-based NaphCare.
Hillsborough sheriff's Col. Ken Davis, commander of the detention services, didn't specify why the county rejected Armor's bid for a new contract.
"If we had been thoroughly pleased with the delivery of service ... we could have renewed the contract," Davis said.
He added: "Obviously, there were good days and bad days."
Davis said Armor's "effort wasn't lacking. We just went with a different direction - a different model, a more of a front-loaded care model as opposed to a reactionary care model."
Also in 2014, Gualtieri, of Pinellas, and Armor agreed that a 30-day notice was enough to cancel the contract the two entered into in September 2013, according to a copy of the letter to Armor CEO Bruce Teal.
Praise from Oklahoma
The correspondence didn't specify why the contract was canceled. Suarez said it was a "mutual agreement to terminate due to the unique staffing nature of the agreement."
Gualtieri declined to comment.
He told the Orlando Sentinel at the time: "Based on this experience, we're going back to doing it in-house, and we're not going down that path again."
In Oklahoma, Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel praised Armor, which provides health care for between 2,200 and 2,800 inmates at the county jail in Oklahoma City.
"We are very satisfied with Armor. They provide excellent care for our inmates and we've been more than satisfied with the quality of care they've provided over the last five years," he said through a spokesman.
In Nassau County, Armor critics such as Legislative Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport) have called for the suspension of Armor's contract after the state report on Gleeson's death.
The state report said Gleeson's death in 2014 may have been prevented if not for his "incompetent and deficient" medical treatment at the jail, which houses about 1,200 inmates.
The commission questioned Armor's ability to meet the needs of inmates where it holds contracts in New York, saying Armor engaged "in a pattern of inadequate and negligent medical care."
Gleeson, 40, an electrician and father of two, suffered from angioedema, a condition that includes bouts of swelling that can escalate into breathing emergencies.
He had pleaded not guilty to burglary on the day he died.
Gleeson's family intends to sue the county, the jail and Armor.
Other Nassau inmates said Gleeson's throat had swollen tremendously hours before his death, and one inmate said he complained of serious breathing trouble, Newsday reported in August.
A spokesman for Mangano said in October the state commission report "raises concerning allegations" and he said the matter has been sent to the county "for review."
Armor has said that the majority of allegations levied against the company "have been unfounded."
Fault found elsewhere
The state Commission of Correction also has issued multiple criticisms after two other inmate deaths in Nassau's jail since the company got the county contract in mid-2011.
In 2012, Armor's care was called "grossly incompetent" by the commission after a Shirley man, Roy Nordstrom, 47, died of a heart attack in jail in 2011 after repeated chest pain complaints.
The state ordered the county executive's office to do an inquiry into Armor's fitness as the jail's medical care provider after finding the company negligent in Nordstrom's death.
In 2013, Armor gave "inadequate evaluation and treatment" to Bartholomew Ryan, 32, who served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq before committing suicide in the jail in 2012, the commission said.
Armor contends it isn't responsible for Ryan's death and that there was no indication the company disregarded Ryan's health and safety.
And the commission is also investigating the 2015 jail custody death of Antonio Marinaccio Jr., 53, of Levittown, whose family filed a notice of claim in July against Nassau, the jail, and correction and police officials.
Among their claims is that Marinaccio was the victim of wrongful death and medical negligence. The family contends the inmate became brain-dead after not getting proper medical care and suffering a heart attack while in jail custody. The family has said jail officials told them he was found in his cell at 3 a.m. on April 26 in cardiac arrest, but that a hospital official said he wasn't brought to the hospital until 4:18 a.m. Marinaccio died May 2 after the family gave permission for him to be taken off life support.
Another state commission report - this one in 2014 - said Pantera's death on Dec. 25, 2012, of hypothermia - complicated by ailments including cardiovascular disease - while in custody in upstate New York was "preventable," if he, too, had gotten adequate treatment at the Niagara County Jail in upstate Lockport.
Pantera, who suffered from mental issues, was charged with stealing a cup of coffee from a 7-Eleven.
At one point, Pantera, who was naked, ran into his cell, knocking himself unconscious; he said "he was trying to get out," the report said.
"This death was the result of grossly inadequate medical and mental health care," the report said.
Pantera's ex-wife has sued Armor and its medical director, court records show.
Buffalo attorney James Vandette, who is handling the suit, could not be reached.
Castaneda, the attorney representing inmates at Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women in Virginia, said the "movement toward privatizing prison systems" is problematic.
"You're handing over a basic constitutional right to a for-profit company," said Castaneda, of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. "Budgets are tight and state agencies are looking for ways to cut their budgets - and this is an easy one."
Fluvanna "virtually never honors" prisoners' request for emergency medical care, alleges the lawsuit, which sought injunctive relief and also named Virginia corrections and Fluvanna officials as defendants.
According to a recently finalized settlement, Fluvanna's new compliance monitor, a former medical director of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, chosen by medical experts representing both sides, will make periodic trips to Fluvanna to review and evaluate medical care.
Armor's critics, like Tulsa attorney Bob Blakemore, said Armor and other private companies are reluctant to send inmates to outside emergency care because of the cost.
"There is a financial disincentive for these staffing agencies to send inmates for outside treatment, even in cases where they're inmates that have complex conditions," said Blakemore, an attorney with Smolen, Smolen & Roytman. The firm's client, Scott Birdwell, was one of several plaintiffs who sued Armor and Tulsa County Sheriff Stanley Glanz alleging inadequate care at the Tulsa County Jail, among other things.
Complaints ignored
Birdwell suffered a serious cut after another inmate struck him over the left eye with an unknown object in June 2014, the suit said.
Armor staff ignored Birdwell's complaints of pain and his request to be hospitalized. The staff waited beyond their suggested 10-day waiting period to remove stitches, causing injury.
The case is pending.
Davis, of the Hillsborough County sheriff's office, acknowledges that inmates are a challenging population to care for.
"They're often sick. They have about as many health problems as any group of people you would find out there," Davis said. "It takes a lot of work to stay in front of their problems."
Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, whose office represents many inmates that Armor treats in the Broward Jail, said he's not sure Armor is "any better or any worse" than other private medical providers.
"If anybody you care about is in jail and is sick, and the health care treatment is provided by Armor or any of these other groups, you best get your loved ones out of jail," he said.
He added: "Because there is a chance that they will get sicker or even die under that care."

NYPD releases video of James Blake thrown to ground by undercover officer

Abstract: Blake released a statement Friday saying, "When this incident was reported in the news media, Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bratton both called me to extend their personal apologies, and I greatly appreciate those gestures.

Full text:   NEW YORK -- Retired tennis star James Blake seemed relaxed and without a care in the world as an undercover officer rushed up to him and wrestled him to the ground outside a Manhattan hotel Wednesday in a case of mistaken identity, according to a surveillance video released Friday by the NYPD.
The video footage, taken by a camera in the taxi driveway of the Grand Hyatt hotel on 42nd Street, showed a nonchalant Blake standing against a building pillar as Officer James Frascatore suddenly enters the frame from the right and grapples with him before taking him down to the sidewalk.
At one point Frascatore's right arm seems close to getting into a chokehold but appears to actually be resting on Blake's right shoulder before sliding off. Blake was then cuffed behind his back as he was face down.
After cops discovered that Blake had been mistakenly identified, the former tennis star had his hands unshackled and was set free.
The release of the video came a day after NYPD Police Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio apologized Thursday to Blake, whom police said was interviewed Thursday night by the NYPD's internal affairs bureau. The investigation is ongoing.
Thursday night, Bratton released a statement saying that he had "personally apologized for yesterday's incident ... Mr. Blake said he would like to meet with the mayor and me at a future date, which we would be agreeable to."
A law enforcement source said a number of police officials were on the line as Bratton talked with Blake in what was described as a "positive" conversation.
The apology came amid persistent questions over why Blake, 35, was detained while waiting at the Grand Hyatt for a ride to the U.S. Open.
Frascatore, 38, has been placed on modified duty and an independent watchdog group has opened an investigation.
Blake released a statement Friday saying, "When this incident was reported in the news media, Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bratton both called me to extend their personal apologies, and I greatly appreciate those gestures. But extending courtesy to a public figure mistreated by the police is not enough. As I told the Commissioner, I am determined to use my voice to turn this unfortunate incident into a catalyst for change in the relationship between the police and the public they serve. For that reason, I am calling upon the City of New York to make a significant financial commitment to improving that relationship, particularly in those neighborhoods where incidents of the type I experienced occur all too frequently."
PBA president Patrick J. Lynch said NYPD officers regret any embarrassment or injury suffered by Blake as a result. "The police officer was apprehending what he had every reason to believe was an individual who had just committed a crime. The apprehension was made under fluid circumstances where the subject might have fled and the officer did a professional job of bringing the individual to the ground to prevent that occurrence," Lynch said in a written statement.
Blake said he was outside the hotel waiting for a taxi to the U.S. Open when a man later identified as Frascatore charged him and threw him to the ground. The officer did not identify himself as a member of the NYPD at the time, Blake said.
The 60-second silent video showed Frascatore rushing up to Blake, grabbing him by the chest and forcibly turning him around. At that point an apparently startled Blake, who reportedly said he thought at first the cop was a friend or fan, appeared on the video to offer slight resistance and was quickly brought down by Frascatore.
Some passersby glanced at the two men but many on the video appeared to pay no attention to the pair as they tussled. One woman is seen on the video telling Frascatore that something fell out of his rear pants pocket, which he retrieved as he stood up with Blake in custody.
NYPD officials said a confidential witness mistakenly identified Blake during an undercover investigation into cellphone fraud. Blake told reporters Wednesday that "it shouldn't have happened and it's something that we'll deal with the police and we'll find out what they have to say internally."
Earlier Thursday in an interview on CNN, Bratton said that Blake, who is black, had a striking resemblance to a suspect in the investigation.
"If you look at the photograph of the suspect, it looks like the twin brother of Mr. Blake," Bratton said, adding that "race had nothing to do with this."
In his four years as a cop, Frascatore had four complaints filed against him with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, said a police official familiar with the case. One case led to Frascatore's exoneration, one was dismissed and another was sustained for the minor infraction of not disclosing his name tag, said the official, adding that details on the fourth complaint were unavailable.
Frascatore is also named with a number of other police officers as a defendant in two lawsuits over unnecessary force filed in Brooklyn federal court. Both cases relate to events in 2013. In a docket entry filed Friday, the court noted that the city and lawyers for the plaintiffs were in settlement discussions.
Outside Frascatore's Oceanside home Friday, reporters waited for him to appear, while neighbors on the tranquil street defended the NYPD veteran.
"I've known him to be a good cop who cares about his job," said neighbor Frank Abramo, 63, a retired restaurant owner. "I'm sure he thought he was doing the right thing."
Frascatore could not be reached for comment.
Thursday evening, de Blasio and Bratton issued a statement saying the city will try to learn from the incident and is investing millions to retrain about 22,000 uniformed service members. "This Administration will continue to vigorously implement these reforms that build trust and respect between police officers and the people they serve, while also keeping New York City the safest big city in America. And we both stand ready to meet with Mr. Blake to further discuss these issues and initiatives," the prepared statement read.

James Blake: NYPD officer who tackled me should be fired

Abstract: Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has defended Frascatore in pursuing a man he thought was a criminal and said he did "a professional job of bringing the individual to the ground."

Full text:   NEW YORK -- The NYPD officer who officials say wrongly body-slammed retired tennis pro James Blake should be fired, the athlete said Saturday.
Blake was tackled Wednesday by Officer James Frascatore outside midtown Manhattan's Grand Hyatt hotel when a team of cops mistook the former tennis star for an identity thief.
"I don't think he deserves to have a badge," Blake told The New York Post. "I hope he can never do that to anyone else and get away with it. I hope he can never do that again under the shield of the New York Police Department."
In a separate interview with the New York Daily News, Blake said of Frascatore: "He doesn't deserve to have the same title as officers who are doing good work and are really helping keep the rest of the city safe."
Frascatore, 38, of Oceanside, has a history of excessive-force lawsuits and civilian complaints. He hasn't been reachable for comment.
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton have apologized to Blake for the officer's behavior.
Bratton said the suspect being pursued in the identity-theft case that led to Blake's mistaken arrest resembled the tennis pro.
Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has defended Frascatore in pursuing a man he thought was a criminal and said he did "a professional job of bringing the individual to the ground." The PBA declined to comment further Saturday.
Frascatore's shield and gun have been taken from him and he's on modified assignment pending the department's internal investigation.
When asked about Blake's demand, an NYPD spokesman, Sgt. Carlos Nieves, said in an email that "there is currently an ongoing Internal Affairs Bureau investigation into the September 9th incident involving Mr. James Blake."
The Post, citing unnamed sources, said Frascatore gave an account in which he claims he identified himself as a cop during the takedown, shouting "Police! Don't move!"
Blake said that was false.
A surveillance video of the arrest shows Blake standing relaxed when the officer later identified as Frascatore rushes up and wrestles him to the ground.
"Yes. I'm not mincing words here," when asked if Frascatore wasn't telling the truth. "In my opinion he should never have a badge again because I think it's people like him that give the entire force a bad name."
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, speaking at an unrelated event, declined to say whether he thinks Frascatore should be fired.
"I'll leave it to the NYPD to come up with the appropriate discipline."
He added: "There is no doubt that Mr. Blake was wrongly treated. It was very disturbing to see that video, to say the least ... I think he deserved an apology from the mayor and from the police commissioner. "

Sydney Seau honors father in Hall of Fame speech

Author: Glauber, Bob

Publication info: TCA News Service ; Chicago [Chicago]08 Aug 2015.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1702263134?accountid=37869

Abstract: The other honorees were former general managers Ron Wolf of the Packers and Bill Polian of the Bills and Colts, Chiefs guard Will Shields, Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown, Vikings center Mick Tingelhoff, 49ers and Cowboys defensive end Charles Haley and Steelers running back Jerome Bettis.

Full text:   CANTON, Ohio -- Sydney Seau knew her wish couldn't come true, but she offered it up anyway. Choking back tears during an emotional on-stage interview at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where the great Chargers, Dolphins and Patriots linebacker was inducted last night, Junior Seau's daughter told a crowd of nearly 22,000 and a national television audience that she wished she could have seen her dad just one more time.
"You are a light, and I want nothing more than to see you come on stage, give the speech you were meant to give, give me a hug and tell me you love me," she said. "Dad, you gave us your time, your presence, your life, but most of all you gave us your heart."
Seau, who enjoyed a 20-year career in which he went to 12 Pro Bowls and two Super Bowls and redefined the linebacker position, took his own life on May 2, 2012, shooting himself in the chest. He was inducted posthumously into the Hall of Fame along with seven others and was presented by his daughter, who spoke in a video tribute and then during an interview with NFL Network reporter Steve Wyche.
Hall of Fame officials initially declined to have her speak at the ceremony, and though she did not speak at the podium, she offered some emotional words about her father's life and legacy. Not mentioning his suicide or the fact that Seau was late-diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head trauma, Sydney provided a small window into what her father might have been feeling in the time leading up to his suicide.
"I know at times it seems everything you accomplished in life wasn't enough," she said, "but today and every day since you held me in your arms for the first time, you were more than just enough. You were everything."
The other honorees were former general managers Ron Wolf of the Packers and Bill Polian of the Bills and Colts, Chiefs guard Will Shields, Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown, Vikings center Mick Tingelhoff, 49ers and Cowboys defensive end Charles Haley and Steelers running back Jerome Bettis.
"I know that his athleticism and talent were extraordinary enough to make it into the Hall," she said. "But it is his passion and heart that is truly legendary and is deserving of this tremendous honor. I would like to thank our family and everyone else for their support through this process. Dad, I love you and I miss you. Congratulations. You made it."
Seau, the fifth overall pick in the 1990 draft, finished with 56 1/2 sacks and 18 interceptions. He had at least 10 tackles in a game 64 times and had a career-high 155 tackles and 5 1/2 sacks in 1994, the only year the Chargers made it to the Super Bowl. He later played in Super Bowl XLII for the Patriots, who lost to the Giants after winning their previous 18 games.
"I think my father would be completely overwhelmed and honored to be elected," Sydney Seau said. "I know this isn't my speech to give. This is his. He spent 20 years in the league, and he deserves this moment. All I can do is humbly attempt to thank the people in his career that made this induction possible."
Sydney paid tribute to her father's parents, who "taught him the true meaning of love, family, how to respect one's culture and selflessness. I know for a fact that he would say this honor is yours, along with the rest of the Seau family."
The Seau family has filed suit against the NFL, claiming the league failed to properly warn the former linebacker of the dangers of head trauma. She did not reference the lawsuit during her remarks or during the video presentation.
"He's the first Samoan to make it into the Hall of Fame, and that is an accomplishment in itself," she said. "He proved that even a young Samoan boy from Oceanside can make his dreams a reality.
"I know he would thank every team, teammate, fan, the community of San Diego and the Chargers for the career of a lifetime. You guys are everything to him. Without you, he wouldn't have become the player that he was. I thank you, as well."

Coffee consumption may prevent recurrence of colon cancer, study says

Author: Ricks, Delthia

Publication info: TCA News Service ; Chicago [Chicago]18 Aug 2015.

Abstract: Daily consumption of caffeinated coffee may prevent a recurrence of colon cancer in people treated for the disease with the strongest benefits for those drinking at least four cups, according to new scientific research.

Full text:   Daily consumption of caffeinated coffee may prevent a recurrence of colon cancer in people treated for the disease with the strongest benefits for those drinking at least four cups, according to new scientific research.
The new findings come with caveats -- and for some doctors, raise a long list of questions.
Pending further research, scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who conducted the study, said people should not begin drinking coffee if they aren't already java drinkers. Those who drink it should not increase their number of daily cups, the scientists said.
The study is the first ever to examine whether coffee plays a role in preventing colon cancer recurrence and lowers mortality from the disease among U.S. residents -- who consume the most coffee globally.
Dr. Jules Garbus, co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y., said the research cannot be easily dismissed because it raises questions about how coffee affects metabolism.
"Diet and lifestyle affect people's cancer risk," Garbus said. He also noted that Dana-Farber's reputation adds credence to the findings. The study's lead investigator, Dr. Charles Fuchs, said it was unclear why coffee didn't prevent the patients' cancers in the first place.
"We only identified subjects following the diagnosis of colon cancer so we don't have their coffee consumption prior to diagnosis," he said in an email.
Fuchs, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber, said people with metabolic disorders have a higher colon cancer risk.
For example, high levels of insulin are associated with elevated risks of the cancer because the hormone can promote the growth of cancer cells. Obesity also is associated with higher colon cancer risk and higher levels of insulin in the blood.
Caffeine helps lower insulin levels and is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, Fuchs wrote in the study.
Nearly 1,000 patients were involved in the research. All had been treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Those who had the best five-year survival rates drank at least four cups of caffeinated coffee daily, consuming about 460 milligrams of caffeine. There was no correlation between a survival benefit and herbal tea consumption, the study found.
Results of the analysis were reported in Monday's Journal of Clinical Oncology. Patients who consumed four daily cups were 42 percent less likely to experience a rebound of their cancer and were 33 percent less likely to die from the disease.
Dr. Robert Amajoyi, a colorectal cancer surgeon at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, N.Y., said while the research sheds new light on a role that coffee might play, he is not yet convinced of a cause-and-effect.
"Coffee has potential anti-mutagenic properties," he said Monday, referring to antioxidants that may help prevent mutations. But it is impossible to say how java consumption affects cancer risk without stronger research, he said.
"That's why I say more studies are required," Amajoyi said, adding that rather than the questionnaire used by the Boston team, he would prefer to see a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, the gold standard of scientific research.
Dr. Peter Bach, a physician and epidemiologist who directs the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, also said more powerful data are required.
"Coffee drinking and lower risk may be related to an unseen third factor. I'm not saying that is the case, but we would only know if this were a true risk-reducing intervention with a randomized trial," Bach said.

Hopes for flight grounded

Abstract: Guretzky said he was inspired by "The Miracle on the Hudson," the January 2009 landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River, and wants to raise money for charity.

Full text:   Neighbors and officials are trying to ground a man's hopes of someday flying his propeller plane down his suburban Oceanside street.
Hempstead Town officials issued Harold Guretzky, 69, a summons to appear in court for parking his 24-foot-long, 38-foot-wide Cessna 152 in his driveway. Guretzky has a Sept. 29 court date and could face a $2,500 fine.
The disassembled plane was towed to Guretzky's home on Yale Street three weeks ago, the result of his effort to avoid the monthly $150 storage fees from Farmingdale Republic Airport.
Guretzky purchased and restored the now reassembled plane last year but recently had his flight certificate suspended due to a heart condition.
He said he plans to get it reinstated once his health improves, but in the meantime would like to have a pilot take off down neighboring Riverside Drive facing the water. He said his plane can reach the air after a 600-foot taxi, or otherwise can land in the water. Guretzky said he was inspired by "The Miracle on the Hudson," the January 2009 landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River, and wants to raise money for charity.
"I'm a 69-year-old man with a bucket list to get my pilot's license," Guretzky said yesterday. "There's no reason someone can't do it. I want to have someone who can put down a plane bring one up into the air."
Hempstead Town officials responded to complaints and served Guretzky a summons July 22 for violating the building department code. He would need a zoning variance to keep the plane in his driveway, town spokesman Mike Deery said.
"It's not an incidental use to owning a home," Deery said. "We got complaints from neighbors who considered it an eyesore. It's apples and oranges to keeping a boat at home. You don't wind up a plane and fly out your driveway."
The town's building department has already cited Guretzky several times for other items on his property, including a 60-foot and a 30-foot antenna he uses as a ham radio operator, Deery said. The town was not aware of any additional citations.
He plans to keep the plane in his driveway and fight the citations.
"I got so many summonses that I could put them up as wallpaper," Guretzky said. "Everyone has a boat. I don't understand why they say I can't have a plane in my driveway."

Hempstead Town to suspend collection of recyclables

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]03 Apr 2020: 12.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2385593587?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Town of Hempstead will stop recycling pickup for 86,000 residents as the town faces staffing shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Supervisor Don Clavin announced that recyclables normally collected by the town's sanitation department would be suspended starting Monday  until further notice. The change will affect communities including Bellmore, Bethpage, East Meadow, Levittown, Lido Beach, Point Lookout, Seaford, Uniondale and Wantagh.
The town has seen an increased number of town workers calling in sick or going into quarantine as a precaution, sanitation Commissioner John Conroy said. He would not say how many employees are ill with coronavirus.
Town officials said they will seek to restart recycling as soon as possible once staffing allows and will review the decision from week to week. Residents are asked to hold their recycling until pickup resumes.
Garbage collection twice a week for the town remains unaffected.
"My biggest concern is getting solid waste off the street, and it's getting tight with our labor force," Conroy said. "The virus is affecting guys getting sick or others getting quarantined."
The town has seen an increase in the amount of garbage put at the curb since the stay-at-home order began, Conroy said. He said homeowners are doing more spring cleaning.
The suspension does not apply to the town's five special sanitation districts or villages, which decide separately on whether to continue recycling pickup.
Oceanside Sanitation District No. 7, which serves ,000 homes and 950  businesses, suspended recycling during the duration of the pandemic.
Town sanitation officials said they are keeping men as separated as possible, including keeping two men to a truck and having a third man meet them at their route before riding on the back of the truck.
"When one guy gets sick, the other two guys go on quarantine," Conroy said. "When I lose one guy, I have to lose three guys. It's not just a couple days, it's for a couple weeks."
Oceanside sanitation stopped collection March 23, but has not seen a decrease in staffing or workers calling out sick, sanitation Commissioner Austin Graff said. The district has changed to rotating shifts three days a week to pick up earlier and get workers home faster, Graff said. Workers remain paid full time.
Oceanside residents are asked to either hold recycling until the crisis ends or add it to garbage collection, where it will be burned.
Hempstead is the only known town on Long Island to suspend recycling services.
Some communities have reduced garbage pickup to one day a week or limited yardwork c

LIers share their daily bread as homemade loaves trend

Author: Hirsch, Corin

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 Apr 2020: 4.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2390069635?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maybe you've noticed it, too. Loaves of bread have begun appearing in social media feeds - tops slashed, edges burnished - from people who you didn't know to be bakers.  Was it a passing anomaly? I thought so, until I received an unexpected text from a friend.
"How do you make yeast?"
My longtime pal had never baked - not a cookie, not a brownie, certainly not a loaf of bread. Yet here he was, on the hunt for yeast - which, let's face it, can't easily be manufactured at home. Except in one particular way. "You mean, make a starter?" I wrote back.
Yes, that is what he meant, a sourdough starter. Still, it was puzzling: Despite panic buying in March, there still seemed to be plenty of bread in supermarkets and bakeries. By contrast, flour and yeast had vanished almost overnight, and soon enough, legions of hitherto non-bakers had begun firing up their ovens.
Quarantine baking is real, but the bread offshoot is a fascinating one, because it's not an easy road. Yeast and flour have almost become contraband - hard to find both in stores and online - and the process itself can be lengthy and tricky. The first time I baked sourdough, from my own new starter (using a process I had found through Googling), it emerged from the oven looking like a baked frisbee, having hardly rose. It had taken approximately the entire weekend to produce. Still, it tasted amazing, and I had officially caught the sourdough bug.
So has Monika Robinson, a photographer in Oceanside, who had been stymied in her search for baking ingredients after shelter-in-place was ordered. "All of a sudden, everyone was baking," she said. "I went to the supermarket and there was absolutely no flour, no yeast, no nothing."
Robinson had never baked before, either, but the idea had possessed her during the first week of quarantine. She eventually scored some yeast from a neighbor and made a no-knead bread "that was the most beautiful bread ever," she said. In the meantime, Robinson also began her own sourdough starter - essentially a slurry of flour and water that you "feed" daily until it becomes a living dough, a source of yeast you draw from for future loaves.
Robinson's starter took about five days to become active, and then she tried her first loaf of sourdough. "As I kneaded the dough, I thought I was gonna pass out. My arms were killing me!" she laughed. Still, after the many hours of rising, proofing and baking, Robinson had a loaf that filled her with pride, even if she made small beginner mistakes - such as not scoring the top of the loaf to direct the oven spring, or rise. "It was so much work, but the smell when it was baking it reminded me of Poland," Robinson said - more specifically, of loaves she used to buy from a bakery in her grandmother's small Polish village. "It felt so good to have my family enjoying it, and for my daughter to say 'this is the best bread ever.'"
Robinson planned to make her second loaf for Easter, to accompany a traditional Polish soup called ?urek, or white borscht. "You need homemade sourdough, or a nice rye or country-style bread," to go with the soup, she said.
Brooke Filosa, who also lives in Oceanside, had baked focaccia before, from a family recipe (her family is from Bari, Italy) but that's where her bread-baking experience stopped. "I never branched beyond [focaccia], but I thought there was no better time than now to try different styles," she said. Filosa went all in, buying a 25-pound bag of flour from Costco. "I was having a hard time finding yeast, though," she said, until a friend hooked her up.
Filosa, who has two young children and owns her own PR company, plunged into multiple styles: A plain, white no-knead bread; an olive no-knead bread; and a Pullman loaf, aka white sandwich bread that's baked in a square pan. "I figured, why not? I had just run out of store-bought sandwich bread," she said. "Now I don't think I'll ever go back [to store bought]. I had a sandwich today, and it was so good. I can see myself making it over and over again."
Further east, in Central Islip, Jim Donahue has been baking on the regular too, but not necessarily because of quarantine: He started his practice under another kind of duress, when he was laid off from a longtime job five years ago. "I had always been scared of baking with yeast, as earlier experiments had not gone terribly well," he said. "Once I started doing it regularly, I got really good at it."
Donahue began to turn out a spectrum of breads, from artisan loaves to sandwich rolls, but also pastries and enriched breads, or those with higher fat content; he recently did a Facebook live on baking chocolate babka, and is planning another on hot cross buns. Donahue's advice for new bakers is persistence. "Be patient, don't be discouraged, even if your first attempt doesn't work out," he said. "Keep at it. Yeast can be mysterious, and every once in awhile, even if you do as you're supposed to do, it doesn't work. That's okay - I just throw it away."
That spirit of adventure seems to partly drive Gay Snow, an avid cook in Bridgehampton who recently decided to take up baking - though not before receiving a vital tool. "I was going to do it all by hand but thought, 'wait a minute, there has to be a better way,'" said Snow. She's ordered a KitchenAid for kneading (it comes equipped with a dough hook).
Snow used to go the store frequently for fresh bread for her family, but as for everyone else, those visits have dwindled. "Now that we're all housebound, I decided I should just bake bread. I know what I like, so I can make my own and play with the crust," Snow said.
Before COVID-19 arrived in the U.S., a prescient Snow stocked up on yeast, flour and other baking essentials (as well as hand sanitizer) months ago. Once she has her Kitchen Aid, she'll be rolling. "The beauty of [baking bread] is less dependency. There's so much we don't have control of right now," she said.
For Filosa, baking has also somehow brought about a deep gratification during an uncertain time. "It's fulfilling to conquer something you've always wanted to try," Filosa said. "I've also been giving loaves of bread to friends and family, and it's been nourishing my heart."
SOURDOUGH TIPS FROM AN EXPERT Ray Smith, co-owner and baker at Blacksmith's Breads in Long Beach - whose sourdough loaves have a devoted following - teaches classes on bread baking, and offered some advice for aspiring and amateur sourdough bakers: Use simplified starter: Throw out any starter recipe that has any more ingredients than flour(s) and water. You don't need honey, potato starch, sugar. Use bread flour for starter: All purpose flour works fine, but can be slack and fall quicker than bread flour when it reaches its peak. Add whole grain flour: A little whole grain flour helps to speed up the process, especially if you're starting one out from scratch yourself.  More natural yeasts are found on the bran and germ present in whole grain flour.  Find recipes that use percentages and weights: Using a digital scale is more precise than relying on volume measurements. Stay calm and carry on: "Don't overthink it, it's just bread," says

On beam vs. cystic fibrosis: Gymnasts from 20 teams bond for charity event

Full text: There weren't any final scores announced after the sixth annual Cartwheel for a Cure gymnastics meet Saturday at Oceanside.
Instead, athletes from the 10 competing teams helped break down and store equipment, while others left with smiles, recounting everything they'd accomplished during the afternoon. Because unlike other meets, this one wasn't about the numbers gymnasts posted in each event.
It was about the numbers they'll donate.
Organized by Cold Spring Harbor coach Teri Kindelmann, the teams raised money for the Boomer Esiason Foundation, funding research for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and other organs. Both of Kindelmann's daughters, 9-year-old Matison and 7-year-old Charlotte, have CF.
"The gymnastics community comes together," Kindelmann said. "This is a little stress-free competition as opposed to dual meets. It's fun for them and they love coming here and being a part of it."
Since its start, the meet has grown and this year, for the first time included all 20 gymnastics teams in Nassau. The other 10 teams will compete at Cold Spring Harbor on Monday afternoon and Kindelmann said she expects the gymnasts will have raised "about $10,000."
"My daughters go to Cohen's Children Hospital, so [the Boomer Esiason Foundation has] been working with my doctors and the CF doctors there," Kindelmann said. "They've been providing new technologies, drug trials and that's what this money we've raised goes toward."
Of course, planning an event of this size isn't easy.
Kindelmann reached out to coaches before the season began, finding "out how many girls are on each team ... We make envelopes, so kids can go ask for donations," and credited Bethpage coach Kim Rhatigan for "helping and making sure everything goes as planned." Teams spent most of December asking for donations, a tradition they've come to relish.
Oceanside coach Andrew Morris said the Sailors asked each of their gymnasts to try and raise $25. By final count, they'd raised nearly $1,400.
"We go around the school and ask our teachers and we ask our friends for the change from their lunch money, ask family members," Oceanside senior Emma Gehrig said. "We go around and see if anyone is willing to give to this cause and almost everyone is because it really means something."
Morris also credited Nassau gymnastics for coming together for a common cause, saying: "I don't think there is another sport that can say they have all of the teams playing that sport do what we've done. There's a lot of generosity here."
For many gymnasts, the meet is an opportunity to compete without much pressure and, perhaps more importantly, watch their friends, as well. Gehrig called gymnastics "a small sport," one in which most of the athletes have known each other far longer than their high school careers.
Though they might not be on the same team all the time, during a day like this, they're all rooting for each other.
"The only other event that you can see so many other teams compete is team counties," Long Beach junior Allison Cohen said. "Seeing all the other girls and how they're having fun and cheering for their team makes it even more special."
Although there wasn't a focus on scores, South Side placed first (160.950) in the meet, led by Erin Agoglia and Payton Waller. Agoglia placed first in the all-around (33.100) and floor (9.300), and Waller finished second in all-around (32.800) and floor (9.100).
In years past, all Cartwheel for a Cure athletes wrap up the meet by doing as many cartwheels as they can in a certain amount of time. The weather prevented that Saturday, with teams leaving to avoid the snowstorm, but despite the cold, nothing could damper their collective spirit or their support of Kindelmann's family.
"These meets, my girls feel like they're superstars," Kindelmann said. "They love that the girls come up to them and talk to them by name. They feel really connected to the girls."

Full text: On a typical school day, a modest gathering of students at a local pizza parlor is a common event. But Sept. 16 was not a typical day as a large number arrived at a strip mall not with an appetite for pizza, but with a hunger for spectacle. The word was out. Fight at Mario's in Oceanside.
Upon hearing this news, it would have been prudent for a student to notify a teacher or a parent or the police. That apparently did not happen. Before things went from bad to worse, it would have been helpful for all of the students to do the moral and ethical thing and stop the fight. I believe their indifference left a young man to die in a parking lot ["Teens videoed stab death, didn't help," News, Sept. 18]. Requests for paper towels from a merchant and a run to a nearby firehouse were too little, too late. Instead, we have video, some of which was not immediately turned over to authorities.
In arguing that some students tried to help, Oceanside schools Superintendent Phyllis S. Harrington sounds like an apologist ["Oceanside students tried to help," Opinion, Sept. 22]. It would be better that she serve the community as an example of public service and obligation by lamenting the behavior of the majority that chose to do nothing.

Bring back bus service to Rte. 109
Thank you for the article "Boost for Suffolk buses" [News, Sept. 19].
I am 76 and I do not drive. I used to ride Nassau County's n72 bus from my home near Route 109 to the Babylon train station. However, that service was eliminated in recent years in my area. Now, I must walk perhaps a half mile just to get to a bus stop for the Suffolk S25 bus to take me to the train station. I know other senior citizens who must do the same.
I am encouraged that officials are considering establishing a new bus route along Route 109 between the Babylon and Farmingdale train stations. We need a bus on Route 109 to the railroad. Please help us!

Charge a gas tax to fund energy options
Now that the youth of the world have voiced their opinion on climate change, and the United Nations convened a summit on the issue, it is time for political action.
The U.S. Congress should lead the way by legislating a carbon tax ["Call for action on climate change," News, Sept. 21]. I propose a 10-cent tax on gasoline per gallon. No one would be exempt. Low-income people could be given some form of a tax rebate. We could use the revenue to give subsidies to renewable energy sources and to find an alternative to fossil fuel.
Surveys show Americans want action on climate change. It is time to sacrifice. Nations of the world are pouring more than 100 million tons of carbon into the air every day. What good are economic growth and a higher gross domestic product if we have an environmental catastrophe? The cost of climate change will outstrip any economic growth based on more pollution.
The United States needs to be in the forefront of environmental protection. Carbon emissions are accelerating at a faster pace, researchers say. As the British politician and historian Thomas Babington Macaulay said, "Reform, that you may preserve."

��
The headline of your Sept. 21 news story on the New York City Climate Strike, "Climate Strike draws scores to New York City," egregiously underplayed the large attendance at this important event.
According to your own article, the event was attended by tens of thousands; and the mayor's office estimated the attendance to have been at least 60,000.
A score means 20. The headline implied that the level of attendance was shy of a hundred. I understand that headline writers are tasked with filling a space of limited dimensions, but this doesn't entitle them to sacrifice truth on the cruel altar of the letter-count god!

SANDLER gets serious: The comedian has done drama before, but his role in 'Uncut Gems' could earn him an Oscar nod in the best actor race

Author: Guzmán, Rafer

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This year's awards season chatter includes four words that might sound strange together:
Adam Sandler, Oscar nominee.
His unexpectedly searing performance as a gambling addict in the dramatic thriller "Uncut Gems" (opening Friday, Dec. 13 in Manhattan; Dec. 25, wide) could put Sandler in the running when the Academy Awards are handed out in February. Granted, this year is shaping up as a highly competitive one for the best actor race, making Sandler far from a shoo-in. But for an actor known mostly for lowbrow comedies ("Happy Gilmore," "Jack and Jill") and a multimillion-dollar, eight-film deal with Netflix that has produced more of the same ("The Ridiculous 6"), the fact that he's being mentioned in the same breath as Oscar is a remarkable development. And this isn't just media hype: On Tuesday, the National Board of Review named Sandler the best actor of the year.
"He's really great in this movie, playing a role against type of what we've come to expect," says Pete Hammond, awards columnist and chief film critic for Deadline. "I would say he's very deserving."
spGARN191204_video
Sandler has a history of making dramatic films with well-established directors: Paul Thomas Anderson for "Punch Drunk Love" in 2002, James L. Brooks for "Spanglish" in 2004, Noah Baumbach for "The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)" in 2017. Josh and Bennie Safdie, the writing-directing brothers behind "Uncut Gems," are known mostly on the art-house circuit, where they've earned critical acclaim for the drug-addiction drama "Heaven Knows What" and the heist film "Good Time," starring Robert Pattinson. The Safdies sent an early script of "Uncut Gems" to Sandler's team in 2012 but were turned down; it was "Good Time," released in 2017, that convinced Sandler to work with them.
Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a shady jewelry dealer in Manhattan's Diamond District who seems to thrive on chaos, stress and the adrenaline rush of the long-shot bet. Ratner is in some ways a Sandler-esque role - a combination of boyish charm and masculine rage - but he can also be vulnerable, even helpless. The Safdies have said Ratner was inspired by their father's stories of working in the Diamond District. (The siblings' tangential connection to Long Island - their mother was raised there - also informs the movie. They constructed the set of Ratner's shop at Gold Coast Studios in Bethpage; Ratner's wife is played by Long Islander Idina Menzel; and one of the film's odder characters, an unnamed bag-man with a deep tan and a toothy smile, is played by Oceanside-raised fashion designer Wayne Diamond.
"It's such a frenetic, tireless, tense performance - it mirrors the energy of the movie," Kevin Polowy, a Yahoo Entertainment correspondent and longtime contributor to the awards-race website GoldDerby, says of Sandler. Polowy is one of a handful of experts at GoldDerby who recently predicted Sandler would become a best actor nominee. "His character shouldn't be likeable, he doesn't have any redeeming qualities to speak of - but you can't help but root for the guy," Polowy says. "And I think that stems from Sandler's utterly desperate performance."
"Uncut Gems" has drawn Sandler out of his comfort zone not only as a performer but as a public figure. Sandler recently gave a rare interview to The New York Times Magazine and has been supporting his movie with in-person appearances at such festivals as Telluride, Toronto and - perhaps most surprising - the highbrow New York Film Festival. In short, Sandler appears to be on the campaign trail.
It's a long way from the publicity circuit to the gold statuette, however, and there are major obstacles in between. Hammond at Deadline points out that "Uncut Gems" arrives in theaters late in the year, giving Oscar voters little time to see it before submitting their nomination ballots Jan. 7. Sandler could also get a boost from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which will announce the nominees for the Golden Globes on Dec.  9. (After first classifying "Uncut Gems" as a comedy, the HFPA reversed its decision earlier this week and placed the film in the dramatic category competition.) One place Sandler might find some awards-season traction is from critics' groups, though they're not normally his biggest supporters.
All of which doesn't even factor in Sandler's potential competition, a roster of such heavyweights as Robert De Niro in "The Irishman," Joaquin Phoenix in "Joker," and both Christian Bale and Matt Damon in "Ford v Ferrari." Adam Driver, in "Marriage Story," also seems a likely nominee. And if there is a wild-card spot in the best actor race, it could go to Eddie Murphy, who earned rave reviews in his Netflix biopic "Dolemite Is My Name."
Ultimately, Sandler's Oscar chances will be in the hands of his fellow actors who vote in the acting categories, according to Hammond.
"When you see him do this role, Howard Ratner is an insane kind of part," Hammond says. "The actors watching this, they're going to be the most receptive to what he does to pull this off." 
WHO IS THAT GUY? Of the many interesting actors you'll see in the Safdie brothers' new crime drama "Uncut Gems," which stars Adam Sandler, professional basketball player Kevin Garnett and the rapper The Weeknd, one is likely to stand out: Oceanside's Wayne Diamond, making his feature-film debut. Playing an unnamed bag-man who helps a young woman (Julia Fox) carry money out of the Mohegan Sun casino, Diamond cuts quite a figure - a swaggering older fellow with a Florida tan, feathered hair and a schmoozer's smile. Appearing out of nowhere near the film's end, Diamond is likely to prompt viewers to ask: Who is that guy? The question isn't easy to answer, partly because there's little information available on Diamond and partly because he's difficult to pin down in conversation. Asked how old he was during a recent phone interview, Diamond responded with the two-word equivalent of a middle finger - then gave a hearty, hoarse laugh. "I'm a kid! I always wanted to be a kid, and I never wanted to get old," Diamond said. "I look good, that's all that matters." Here's what could be pieced together from Diamond's ping-ponging talk. He is Jewish, grew up middle-class and attended Oceanside High School, where his father taught accounting. After graduation he worked in Manhattan's garment industry and eventually formed his own clothing line, Diamonds Run, which rode the trends of the disco-driven 1970s and the puffy-shouldered 1980s. (You can still find his dresses at the vintage site Etsy.) According to Diamond, his jumpsuits were the talk of the town. "I made hundreds of jumpsuits, different styles," he said. "I was a designer, it was really fun. But in my heart, I really wanted to be an actor." After selling his business in 2001 and retiring with a $110 million nest egg, Diamond lived in Old Westbury for a time and went through a listless period. While drinking at The Spotted Pig in Manhattan one evening, Diamond struck up a conversation with a young director named Josh Safdie, who enjoyed his colorful stories and jokes. They kept in touch. Eventually, Josh and his brother, Bennie, found a role for Diamond in "Uncut Gems." "I still go to school for acting. I want to get a real part, a serious part," Diamond said. "I like Shakespeare, the Russian artists, that stuff." He added, "I'd like to do some real stuff. Something to show that I have talent."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He appears out of nowhere at the tail end of the Safdie brothers' acclaimed crime drama "Uncut Gems," playing a sleazy operator who helps a young woman ferry bags of cash to the Mohegan Sun. He makes quite an impression - the feathered hair of a 1970s rock star, a dazzling white smile and the come-hither body language of a man who has seen his share of hot tubs.
He's Wayne Diamond, a former fashion designer who hails from Oceanside. And if he has his way, you'll be seeing a lot more of him.
In a movie that features many an interesting face in an unexpected role - Adam Sandler as a gambling addict, pro basketball player Kevin Garnett as himself - Diamond stands out. It's easy to see why the Safdie brothers ("Good Time"), an audacious filmmaking duo with an affinity for the glamorous-gritty New York of yore, would be attracted to Diamond: He lived through the era and has the stories to prove it.
"If you try to describe Wayne Diamond with words, it just doesn't work," says "Uncut Gems" producer Sebastian Bear-McClard. "What you see in the movie is actually a dialed-down version of Wayne."
A natural raconteur with a zigzagging mind and a tendency toward blue humor, Diamond can be a colorful if challenging interview. (His conversation has been cleaned up for print purposes; if this were television, the bleeps would be plentiful.) During a recent visit to his Upper East Side apartment, where he lives with his wife, Helen, and an excitable Cockapoo named Sable, Diamond ping-ponged between two personalities: a classic Manhattan swinger (he still remembers all the old street names for quaaludes) and your technology-challenged grandfather ("Alexa, turn off big bulb!" he bellows, to no effect).
Diamond describes himself as a nice Jewish kid who attended Oceanside High School, where his father taught accounting. (Diamond won't reveal his age. Ask, and you'll get a friendly insult.) He worked a series of odd jobs that he still takes pride in - cabdriver, pizza delivery boy, sprinkler installer, clam shucker - until his father suggested he seek employment in Manhattan's Garment Center.
It turned out to be sage advice. Diamond worked for a series of clothing labels, learned how to sew and design women's apparel, then went into business for himself. The time was the mid-1970s, and the sci-fi movie "Logan's Run" had been a hit, so Diamond called his business Diamond's Run.
It was a good run, too: Diamond's dresses were sold at high-end department stores like Lord & Taylor (you can still find them on the vintage-clothing site Etsy), and he designed outfits for Vanna White. After work, he made the scene at such storied discotheques as Hippopotamus, Studio 54, Xenon and Limelight.
"You went to work, you got high, you went to the clubs," he says, adding fondly, "The chicks were so hot."
Fashioning a new career
Fashion lost its luster for him in the 1990s. Diamond sold his business for roughly $110 million and moved to Old Westbury but found himself bored. In his heart, he says, he had always wanted to be an actor.
Opportunity knocked about nine years ago when Diamond was hanging out at the Manhattan watering hole The Spotted Pig.
"One voice was piercing through all the din and clatter of the crowd there, and it was Wayne Diamond's voice, just cursing up a storm," recalls Bear-McClard. "You weren't sure if he was wildly inebriated or getting in a fight or just performing." Fascinated, Bear-McClard introduced himself and gave Diamond his number. A friendship developed - Diamond also wound up meeting the Safdies - and when "Uncut Gems" finally began casting, the filmmakers had an idea of who should play their bag man.
"He kind of organically worked his way into the DNA of the movie," Bear-McClard says. "The only guy you could cast in that part was Wayne Diamond."
Now splitting his time between Manhattan, East Hampton and the Delano Hotel in Miami, Diamond says he hopes to become an all-around entertainer: Comedy, television, commercials, maybe even the stage. With a little prompting, he can recite the opening monologue from Shakespeare's "Richard III."
"I've got a long future," he says. "After this, who knows?"

SUPERB SHORTSTOPS: NASSAU BOASTS THREE PLAYERS WITH OFFENSE AS GOOD AS THEIR DEFENSE

Author: O'Brien, Owen

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A trio of Nassau shortstops, featuring East Meadow's Jenna Laird, Port Washington's Maddie Gallagher and Oceanside's Emily Seaver, returns off sophomore seasons with at least a .450 batting average and playing stellar defense at one of the most important positions on the field.
And they all share the love of the control, stability and action a standout shortstop can provide for a team.
"You're in charge of the infield," Gallagher said. "You get everybody going, get them hyped up for the game and you get a lot of action over there. You're kind of like the captain in a way, I think it's an important role."
Gallagher, who hit .638 with a 1.896 OPS and 19 extra-base hits with 15 stolen bases, has played on varsity since the seventh grade. She's verbally committed to play at the University of South Carolina and plays for a travel team based in Tampa, Florida, constantly traveling back and forth.
"I wouldn't have done it if I didn't love the sport, so everything I do is because I have a love for the sport," Gallagher said. "So balancing work and softball, it's not even that big of a deal because everything I'm doing, I love."
Laird, a two-time Newsday All-Long Island selection and last year's Nassau Player of the Year, has led the Jets to back-to-back Long Island Class AA championships, and the state championship in 2017. She hit .663 with 56 runs scored, 19 stolen bases and 34 RBIs last season as a true five-tool player.
The junior will be taking on even a larger leadership role this season, which often comes natural to a shortstop. Laird is no exception to that.
"I like that I can put my positive influence on everyone else on the team," she said. "I just get to use my positive vibes and give it to them."
But when she's between the lines, Laird takes control and demands the best of herself.
"My favorite part of shortstop is that you are in charge of the whole infield," said Laird, who is verbally committed to the University of Missouri. "You can be doing anything. If you call the ball, it's yours."
And for Seaver, she even sees similarities between the mindset needed at shortstop and when at the plate. The Oceanside junior hit .455 with 12 home runs and 30 RBIs last season, showing aggression in the batter's box.
"There's some similarities, definitely," Seaver said. "I feel like when I'm at bat, I have to focus on every pitch, be ready for every pitch."
And with the three playing not only in the same county, but the same conference, friendly competitions and achievement comparisons are bound to happen. This is something the trio embraces.
"It's definitely motivating because they are both really good players," Seaver said.
Laird and Gallagher said they are close friends off the field, but the competitive natures between the two constantly come out between the lines.
"We've always had that, if you do something, I'm going to try to do something, too, so we go back and forth in competition," Gallagher said. "But we're always helping each other get better and strive off each other, competing to get to the next level and eventually get to the SEC and thrive there."
But before then, there's still two more years of bragging rights on the line. Laird is trying to keep East Meadow's championship streak alive and Gallagher and Seaver look to lead their teams to a chance to compete for a state title.
"My goal is just to win," Laird said. "I love winning and I want to keep winning throughout the whole entire season."
Other shortstops to watch: Heather Berberich, Calhoun, Sr.; Brianna Castro, Holy Trinity, Sr.; Chrissy Coan, Bay Shore, Sr.; Allison Dell'Orto, East Islip, Sr.; Jaynise Espinal, Glen Cove, Sr.; Jacquelyn Gregorovic, Farmingdale, Sr.; Julie Hilcken, Seaford, Sr.; Akemi Poyer, Elmont, Sr.; Destiny Schook, North Babylon, Sr.; Emily Van O'Linda, Wantagh, Soph.

Nielsen-Koester: Top All-Starters

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's a highly anticipated righty-lefty matchup in this year's 15th annual Rawlings Grand Slam Challenge, pitting the top seniors from Nassau and Suffolk against each other. Hard-throwing Ward Melville lefthander Max Nielsen will face Chaminade righthander Logan Koester in the all-star showcase, which is slated for a 5:30 p.m. start Tuesday at Hofstra.
All proceeds will benefit St. Jude's Children's Hospital. The admission is $10.
Nielsen, who fanned 103 hitters in 52 innings for the Patriots, will play for UConn next season.
Koester, the Catholic League's pitcher of the year, was drafted by the Phillies in the 32nd round. He decided to pass on the professional baseball opportunity and honor his baseball scholarship to attend George Washington.
"It's an honor to be recognized as one of the top pitchers on Long Island," Koester said. "The opportunity to throw the first pitch for the Nassau squad is unbelievable. I'm truly excited."
Koester is another dominant pitcher in a long line of overpowering aces to play in this game. He finished 7-0 with a 0.44 ERA in leading the Flyers to the CHSAA title.
Long Island, traditionally a pitching-rich area, has seen double digits in strikeouts in these games for the past seven years. In 15 years of some fantastic finishes, there has never been a home run.
"There's been so many great pitchers' duels in these games," said Jon Mauchan, the area scout for the Minnesota Twins and a Rawlings representative. "There's a bunch of big bats on both sides this year. I think we're going to see some real hitting."
Nassau is led by Herricks catcher Matt Yip, who had six home runs and 31 RBIs. Massapequa catcher Nick Schwartz hit five homers and drove in 27 runs.
Suffolk has Center Moriches catcher Alec Maag, who led the Red Devils to the state Class B title, homering in the championship game. It also will get some pop from Shoreham-Wading River's DJ Brown, who had five homers, and Hills West's Aidan Tornquist, who hit three homers in one game this season.
"The hitters need to be relaxed and just go up and swing it," said Suffolk coach Tom Migliozzi (Half Hollow Hills West). "It's an all-star game, let's have fun. There will be no bunting."

$1.75M gift will be used to open LI cancer center

Author: Reich-Hale, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: South Nassau Communities Hospital said it has received a $1.75 million gift that will be put toward opening a cancer center at its main campus in Oceanside.
The money was granted by the Louis Feil Charitable Lead Annuity Trust, which South Nassau said has given more than $8.45 million to the hospital in the past several years.
The new cancer center could open in three to five years, said Dr. Rajiv Datta, chairman of the department of surgery and director of cancer services at South Nassau. 
The $1.75 million donation was the largest gift the hospital received in 2018, South Nassau officials said.
"It is very gratifying for my family and me to see the gifts made by our family's Trust invested for the sole benefit of the patients that turn to South Nassau for the care they need to fight a cancer diagnosis," Jeffrey J. Feil said in a statement. "South Nassau is my hospital and it is my honor to support their mission."
Feil and his parents, the late Gertrude and Louis Feil, have been lifelong residents of Rockville Centre. Feil serves as president and CEO of The Feil Organization, a family-owned real estate investment, development and management company based in Manhattan.
The hospital is also expanding cancer care through Manhattan-based Mount Sinai Health System, which South Nassau joined last year. By aligning itself with Mount Sinai's Tisch Cancer Institute, South Nassau said its patients will have access to "cutting-edge clinical trials and leading physicians." 
Datta said South Nassau's relationship with Mount Sinai helps it take care "of all cancer patients. If the care is more advanced, they go to Tisch, but the simple follow-up appointments can be handled here. Also, Mount Sinai experts are spending time here."
In 2018, South Nassau added services for liver cancer and expanded its staff of medical oncologists. An infusion center was opened at the Oceanside hospital's main campus in 2017.
South Nassau operates the Gertrude & Louis Feil Cancer Center in Valley Stream, while a range of other services are located at the hospital and at satellite facilities along Nassau County's South Shore. The Valley Stream location would remain open once the new facility in Oceanside is built, Datta said.
Health systems throughout Long Island are building out their cancer care services. 
For instance, Manhattan-based Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center plans to open a 114,000-square-foot facility at the Hub in Uniondale in April, and Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip said it plans to open a cancer center at its hospital later this year.
Stony Brook Medicine recently opened a 240,000-square-foot cancer center on the university's East Campus.
New Hyde Park-based Northwell Health this year said it had revamped the clinical leadership in its cancer care unit. The health system appointed three deputy physicians-in-chief to lead medical, surgical and radiation oncology across the 23-hospital health system.
There were 18,000 new cases of cancer per year on Long Island, on average, from 2011 through 2015, according to the most recent data available from the state Department of Health.

Full text: The Massapequa baseball team has a motto: It's only weird if it doesn't work.
From the Little League level up to the majors, baseball players are known as some of the most superstitious groups of people. Superstitions can arise from a desire for comfort, pure enjoyment, or just not wanting to mess with something that's working.
And for the Massapequa baseball team, everything worked the final six weeks of the season. The Chiefs ended on a 17-game winning streak and won the state Class AA championship, defeating Baldwinsville, 10-1, at Binghamton University. It was the second state baseball championship in school history.
So with a list of at least 17 superstitions told by senior catcher and captain Andy Primm - ranging from specific song lyrics in a group chat, stretches, pregame routines and seating arrangements on the bus - it's no wonder the Chiefs wanted to keep things as consistent as possible to end their spring.
"It got to the point where it just started to get contagious and soon enough, everyone was making sure we didn't change one thing," Primm said. "The guys really started getting into it. We didn't care what we did or how weird it would be. If it works, we use it."
During a trip to Cooperstown, the players purchased a wooden bat and engraved "Sheedy and Caf 2018" for coach Sheedy and assistant coach Chris Cafiero. They brought it to every game, all resulting in victories, and the team plans to have a ceremony for the bat during the summer.
Other superstitions included the team's song list before games. Primm would text quotes from the songs to the team's group text at specific times on the days of games. Players also sat in the same seats on the bus every game.
Before every playoff game, assistant coach Brian Rath handed a piece of gum to every player on the team. Pitcher Kenny Galvin wore the same black and blue Oakley sunglasses regardless of the time or weather conditions until he was told to pitch. The team had specific sayings and stretching routines it never altered.
"You've got to let their personalities come out," Sheedy said. "And I'm glad they have those kinds of things."
"The superstitions, it just brings the guys together," said senior second baseman James Zupo, who had a three-run triple in the state championship game. "You know you're playing for the guy next to you and you know he wants you to succeed no matter what."
And the wins just kept following. After being swept by Oceanside and losing by a total of 20 runs in the mid-April series, the Chiefs knew things had to change if they wanted a deep postseason run.
"We got embarrassed by a good team and we were just done with losing," said senior centerfielder Aidan Cooney, who had two RBI singles in the state championship game. "We had a lot of young kids that we had to bring into the team concept and ever since we did that, we've just been rolling."
With all nine starters either scoring a run or delivering an RBI in the state final, Massapequa (22-6) proved that a slow start doesn't define a season.
"No one can tell this team that they can lose," said sophomore third baseman Johnny Castagnozzi. "We can't lose. We fight no matter what the odds are and we're state champs and it's something we're going to remember the rest of our lives."

Back for a Commander performance: A homecoming of sorts Saturday at My Father's Place for a roots music leader of the '70s

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen were founded at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, forging a unique combination of western swing country and boogie-woogie rock.
When they took that combination to San Francisco in 1968, it quickly caught on, with the band landing an audition for the legendary promoter Bill Graham within a month. In two months, they were opening for the Grateful Dead.
What many don't know, though, is that while Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen found inspiration all over the country for their wild ride, it all began on Long Island.
After all, The Commander, who was known as George Frayne then, still clearly remembers the day at Oceanside High School when he was first captivated by the piano.
"I took piano lessons, but that sucked," says The Commander, calling from his home base in Saratoga Springs. "I took music at Oceanside High School, but that was just something to do before track practice. But the music teacher Mr. O'Leary would get the class' attention by sitting in the corner on the piano playing this kind of music."
When young George first heard him play "The Army Boogie" on piano, he was hooked. Suddenly, there was more to his life than competing in the shotput and the high jump events for the track team, even when his family moved from Oceanside to Bay Shore before his junior year.
"I went home and told my mom that I heard some piano playing that I really liked," The Commander recalls. "Well, she used to hang out in Greenwich Village with Eddie Condon. And she got me the piano player from Eddie Condon's orchestra, who so happened to live in Massapequa and was teaching piano in Rockville Centre. He taught me boogie-woogie music, chords and some jazz."
The Commander remembers having trouble playing to a metronome and that his teacher told him he would never make it - something he happily never let his teacher forget, even though he remains grateful. "Without him, 'Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar' never would have happened," he says. "I took what he taught me and just played boogie-woogie music to entertain my friends."
That continued when he graduated from Bay Shore High School to study art at the University of Michigan, forming a band to play fraternity parties and bars around Ann Arbor for fun. "I was also the marijuana guy in Ann Arbor at the time," The Commander says, laughing. "I paid people in joints."
When guitarist Bill Kirchen moved to San Francisco in 1969 and found that people there would enjoy their mix of rock and country, he convinced The Commander and the rest of the band to join him out there. And Kirchen turned out to be right.
"No one had ever heard steel guitar and a fiddle there before," he says. "We played rockabilly music with a swing feel to it and people loved it right away."
Soon, Commander Cody and His Lost Pilot Airmen had a record deal with Paramount Records. When they released their debut album "Lost in the Ozone" in 1971, they quickly landed a Top 10 hit with "Hot Rod Lincoln" and set off on tour.
One of the first places The Commander wanted to play was Long Island. "I just wanted to show my high school and lifeguard friends what I was doing," he said.
They had a show at the C.W. Post campus in Brookville, but no alcohol was served so they couldn't really party. That was when they decided to try out a new club in Roslyn called My Father's Place.
"I was just trying to help myself out," The Commander says. "I wanted a place on Long Island where people could come out and see me without having to go to Manhattan."
However, for Michael "Eppy" Epstein, co-founder of My Father's Place, the Commander Cody gig turned out to be incredibly important.
"At the time, I was booking bands at a payphone," Epstein recalls. "Someone with the band told me they wanted to have the after-party at the club and that I would sell more beer than I could possibly think of so I agreed and ordered the beer. After the show, they made an announcement that the party would continue at My Father's Place. Nobody knew who we were. We had only been open three or four months. But there was a caravan of cars to the place and we really did sell more beer than ever."
"After that," Epstein says, "the floodgates opened."
My Father's Place quickly became a stop on the tours of up-and-coming rock acts, including Bruce Springsteen and Bob Marley. And Commander Cody and His Lost Pilot Airmen had a Long Island club to call home twice a year.
The Commander says he's looking forward to playing the new My Father's Place at The Roslyn Hotel on Saturday, Nov. 3. "I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of friends," he says. "It should be quite interesting. I think Bill [Kirchen] is going to jam with us."
And Commander Cody is also looking forward to the future. He has long been an accomplished painter and in recent years, painting has become his focus. But he is captivated by music once again.
"I have a new live album in the can that I will finish mastering this winter," he says. "I have a new label, Rockbeat Records, and people have been listening to our music online so much, I recently got a check from a record company. That's my first check from a record company in 45 years.... We're going to be doing some fresh material with a fresh band. That should be exciting. It's as it should be."

Full text: LONG BEACH / OCEANSIDE
Information session
on hospital expansion
South Nassau Communities Hospital will hold a public information session Wednesday about its plan to build a $40 million medical arts pavilion in Long Beach and an addition to its Oceanside hospital.
The meeting comes after residents at recent city council meetings clamored for a full hospital to return to the barrier island.
Hospital officials announced last month that the Long Beach pavilion would not house a new emergency room, but the hospital will continue to operate the 24-hour stand-alone emergency room, which opened in 2015. The medical arts pavilion is to offer radiology and treatment in primary care, pediatrics and OB-GYN, plus rotating specialists for cardiology and urology.
South Nassau officials will present its revised plans from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Long Beach Public Library on Park Avenue.
The Long Beach Medical Center was shuttered in 2012 after it was flooded during superstorm Sandy. Later, the hospital declared bankruptcy, and South Nassau bought it in 2014.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency awarded $154 million in disaster funds after the hospital was closed. FEMA approved an alternative-use plan to spend $40 million on a medical pavilion in Long Beach and $113 million in upgrades in Oceanside.

COLD SPRING HARBOR
Parking restrictedon West Gate Drive
The Huntington Town Board has approved new traffic regulations for a street in Cold Spring Harbor.
The new regulations prohibit parking on a stretch of West Gate Drive on both sides just north of Promenade Drive, near the Cold Spring Country Club.
The board held a public hearing at its Nov. 20 board meeting about the proposed regulations.
The board approved the regulations unanimously, 5-0, at Tuesday's board meeting.

FLORAL PARK
Police dept. changes,LIRR consultant hired
Board trustees in Floral Park on Tuesday promoted a village police officer to sergeant.
Dean Mayo, who spent 12 years with the New York Police Department before coming to Floral Park, was promoted following the retirements of six of the police department's senior-level employees in recent weeks, including a former commissioner.
Lt. Michael P. Reid, who served as commissioner from 1993 to 2010, retired in November along with Lt. Mike Suppe, Sgt. Ronald Gagliano, Sgt. Joseph Oswald, John Crilley, and John Marrinan. Trustees approved paying out the remaining accrued work hours for Gagliano and Suppe.
At the meeting, trustees also approved a $50,000 proposal to retain Massachusetts-based engineering firm Vertex as technical consultant for the work taking place on the Long Island Rail Road's third track project. - KHRISTOPHER J. BROOKS
NORTH FORK
Towns ponder earlier
board meeting in '19
North Fork town boards are moving toward earlier evening meetings next year.
In Riverhead, the town board voted 3-1 at its Tuesday regular meeting to set the second of two biweekly regular meetings in 2019 to 6 p.m. Town Councilwoman Catherine Kent, who voted to approve the schedule, said she favored the new schedule because she felt more people were likely to come at an earlier time.
However, Town Councilwoman Jodi Giglio, who voted against it, said she preferred keeping a 7 p.m. meeting time from April through September, as the daylight hours are longer in those months.
The Southold Town Board is also considering scheduling regular evening meetings one hour earlier next year.
The board this year usually met biweekly at 4 or 7:30 p.m.
Southold Town Councilman Robert Ghosio at the board's Tuesday work session proposed a 6:30 p.m. meeting time.
However, Southold Deputy Supervisor William Ruland and Town Councilman James Dinizio said they prefer to keep the meeting times unchanged.
Southold Supervisor Scott Russell suggested the board discuss the proposed schedule change at a public hearing at a later time.

ISLIP
Historic town photos displayed at airport
Long Island MacArthur Airport passengers have a new activity to occupy their time while waiting for flights this month: exploring Islip Town's history.
Town officials unveiled a historic photograph display at the Ronkonkoma airport last Monday during the annual lighting of the airport's Christmas tree and menorah. The photos show the town's historic and significant buildings, as well as beaches and diners.
The display is part of a yearlong celebration of the 335th anniversary of the land deal that launched the town.
"For centuries, the Town of Islip has been attracting visitors and serving as an epicenter for transportation - both air and rail," Supervisor Angie Carpenter said in a statement.
"It makes sense for our yearlong 335th Birthday Celebration, to highlight MacArthur Airport. The airfield represents both the past and the future for this region."
The photos will be on display for 30 days.
Town officials are marking the 335th anniversary with a yearlong celebration.

Full text: South Nassau Communities Hospital said Monday that the Louis Feil Charitable Lead Annuity Trust made a $1.5 million donation to help relocate the hospital's cancer services and departments to a centralized cancer center at the hospital's main location in Oceanside.
The hospital's Gertrude & Louis Feil Cancer Center is in Valley Stream, while other components of its cancer care are provided in Oceanside or at various hospital satellite facilities throughout the South Shore of Nassau County.
The hospital said in a statement the current setup can be an "inconvenience and logistically challenging for patients and their families."
"This gracious gift will be instrumental to South Nassau's continued drive to provide the most accessible, compassionate cancer care that Long Island residents deserve and need," Richard J. Murphy, president and chief executive at South Nassau, said in a statement.
Physicians will continue to see patients at the Valley Stream facility for the time being. When the cancer center is relocated, the Valley Stream building will be repurposed, a hospital spokeman said.
The new Oceanside center will keep the Gertrude & Louis Feil Cancer Center name.
The donation was made last year.
The Feil family has given more than $6.5 million to South Nassau in recent years, including $3 million in 2011 that supported the continued growth and expansion of the Feil Cancer Center.
"It is gratifying to know that the Trust continues to play an integral role in South Nassau's cancer care services and helps hundreds of residents across the South Shore have convenient access to world-class clinicians and advanced treatments that give them the inspiration they need to fight a cancer diagnosis," Jeffrey J. Feil said in a statement.
Feil, his sisters and their families, including their parents, the late Gertrude and Louis, have been lifelong residents of Rockville Centre.
Feil serves as president and chief executive of The Feil Organization, a family-owned real estate investment, development and management company.

After Parkland shooting, ex-LIer Andrew Pollack feels 'empowered': Stoneman Douglas victim Meadow Pollack's father said he will fight for school safety. He visited the White House again on Thursday

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the aftermath of the Parkland, Florida, shooting, Andrew Pollack emerged as an image of both grief and strength while sharing his heartbreak at a White House listening session.
"I'm pissed. Because my daughter - I'm not going to see her again. She's not here. She's not here," an emotional Pollack told the room in a widely shared clip of the speech. "She's in North Lauderdale, at whatever it is, King David Cemetery, that's where I go to see my kid now."
But that speech almost didn't happen, Pollack said Tuesday. In fact, he wasn't scheduled to attend the session at all. The Long Island native was at the White House for a private meeting. When offered the chance to attend the public session afterward, he decided to accept for his daughter, Meadow, 18.
"First somebody murders your kid," said Pollack, of Coral Springs. "Then you get empowered like you've never been before."
Pollack, 52, has "Long Island running through my veins," he said. He grew up in Oceanside, where he delivered newspapers as a boy. He graduated from Oceanside High School in 1984 before moving to Florida in 1999.
In the two weeks since a gunman entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and began to fire, killing 17 people, Pollack said he's taken comfort in his Long Island roots. Meadow's mother, Shara Kaplan, is also from Oceanside.
Relatives and friends still on the Island have reached out, and students he worked with as a lacrosse coach have expressed their condolences. Hofstra's men's lacrosse team, where one of his former athletes now plays, sent him a jersey and helmet signed by the team.
"No one stronger than a New Yorker," Pollack said.
Pollack never imagined he'd be one of the faces of a growing movement against school gun violence, but his face was one of the first to emerge from the scene on Feb. 14 - the Palm Beach Post had a photo of him sitting in his car, holding up a photo of Meadow displayed on his phone.
Pollack was not one of the lucky parents to be reunited with his child. Instead, Meadow was among the dead. She was shot nine times, he said, a fact that weighed heavily on him when he accepted an invitation to meet privately with President Donald Trump on Feb. 21.
Trump expressed his condolences during the 20-minute meeting, Pollack said. Because Trump has children and grandchildren, Pollack said he felt understood.
"Then they said you don't have to, but we're doing this listening session and you can come," he said.
Pollack said he got up and spoke from the heart, in his unmistakable Long Island accent. He hasn't watched his own speech or any news at all - "It's too emotional for me to watch that kind of stuff," he said.
But the New Yorker in him wants to fight and now he has a platform, he said. He's fighting for school safety and he's fighting a false sense of safety he said parents today have fallen into.
"I feel like a lion, that someone poked me and they woke me up and I'm angry," he said. "We have a failed system, every school system has failed."
Pollack said he's not interested in the partisan politics of gun-control debates. He calls his views those of "the Human Party," and he seeks to unify communities to protect children.
He returned to the White House for a meeting Thursday and also plans to visit Tallahassee, where he will show his support for Gov. Rick Scott's school-safety proposal.
The bill calls for $450 million to fund police officers, metal detectors and bulletproof glass, among other safety upgrades, on school campuses. Scott's bill would also fund mental-health programs and raise the age to buy a firearm in Florida to 21.
Pollack wants Florida to lead by being proactive about school safety, but he said he wants to see reform in New York next.
"I thought she was safe at school," he said. "If it can happen to me, a regular guy from Long Island, it can happen to anyone."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Mount Sinai High School team has taken the top spot in this year's Bay Scallop Bowl.
The five-student team - Clare Dana, Joshua Goodman, Julia McElheron, Arielle Mulé and Johnathan Yu - beat out 11 other tristate-area teams to place first in the "Jeopardy!"-style competition, which tests knowledge of oceanography and related sciences. It was held at Stony Brook University.
For winning, Mount Sinai's team members each received $250 and the team qualified for the National Ocean Sciences Bowl in Colorado on April 19-22. The school has won the local bowl 10 of the past 17 years.
Teams from Huntington and Massapequa high schools placed second and third, respectively.
"This year we sweated it out," Mount Sinai coach Glynis Nau-Ritter said. Of her team, she said: "They're a wonderful group with a lot of potential."
The competition featured a morning round-robin format in which teams were separated into divisions to determine seedings based upon overall records and points. The afternoon session consisted of a double-elimination playoff bracket.
Huntington's second-place team members - Erin Bonitz, Katherine Burton, Christiana DeLuca, Michael McCooey and Noah Morris - each received $100.
Massapequa's third-place team received tickets and behind-the-scenes passes to the Long Island Aquarium in Riverhead.
JERICHO/OCEANSIDE
Schools to Watch
Jericho and Oceanside middle schools are the only Nassau County schools among 21 statewide identified as "2018 Essential Elements: Schools to Watch" by the New York State Education Department and the New York State Middle School Association.
The program recognizes schools that demonstrate continuous improvement and excel in four domains: academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, social equity and organizational structure. Schools hold the designation for three years, then must reapply and be reevaluated.
This is the third and second time, respectively, Jericho and Oceanside have earned the redesignation. In Suffolk County, Longwood Junior High School in Middle Island and Sayville Middle School were redesignated.
COUNTYWIDE
Olympic learning
Many local schools hosted educational activities last month themed around the 2018 Winter Olympics.
In East Norwich, James H. Vernon Elementary School put an Olympic spin on its Pick a Reading Partner program with a giant Olympic torch in the lobby, Olympics-related books in the library, and an opening ceremony that featured sixth-grade trumpeters performing Leo Arnaud's "Bugler's Dream," the Olympics' theme song.
In Elmont, Covert Avenue Elementary School hosted a Greek Olympics to culminate sixth-graders' studies of Greek city-states and the history of the Olympic Games. Each class dressed in togas and leaf crowns with games ranging from scooter races to rope climbing.
In Bellmore, Martin Avenue Elementary School hosted Olympics-themed crafts and challenges, including creating Olympic rings out of construction paper and speed skating using paper plates.
ISLANDWIDE
Students of the Year
Twenty local students are candidates in this year's Students of the Year campaign coordinated by the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Long Island Chapter. The campaign challenges them to raise the most money for blood cancer research in a seven-week span.
The students and their high schools are: Hunter Howard and Maya Montalto, Babylon; Anna Kearns, Bayport-Blue Point; Gabby Sennert, Division Avenue; Rosana Gest and Avery Schwartz, Half Hollow Hills West; PJ Darmody, Kellenberg; Ashley Gordon and Avi Nessim, North Shore Hebrew Academy; Maddie Girard and Casey Roszko, Manhasset; Marissa Schneider, Syosset; Jillian Bove and Ally Szema, Ward Melville; Maegan Herman, Kelly Mulvey and Danielle Spencer, Wellington C.

Comment sought on
250 E. Main St. site
State Department of Environmental Conservation officials said they are seeking public comment on a draft plan to investigate contamination at a Bay Shore medical office building site.
The owner of 250 E. Main St. is looking to test soil and groundwater samples to determine if further remediation is needed under the state's Brownfield Cleanup Program, according to a copy of the draft plan.
The parcel, which is adjacent to Southside Hospital, previously housed a dry cleaners and automotive service station. Northwell Health has operated a medical office building there since 2016 after the site was redeveloped.
The Suffolk County Department of Health Services detected chlorinated volatile organic compounds at the site in 1983. Subsequent cleanups were completed in several phases up through 2015, including pumping out sludge and removing underground storage tanks and tons of contaminated soil. Groundwater monitoring wells were also installed.
A copy of the application, prepared by Islandia-based environmental consulting firm Roux Associates Inc., for client 250 East Main Street LLC, is available at the Bay Shore-Brightwaters Public Library, 1 South Country Rd. in Brightwaters.
All comments on the consulting firm's application are due by June 1 and can be submitted online at nwsdy.li/250Main or by mail to Jahan Reza, Project Manager, NYSDEC, SUNY at Stony Brook, 50 Circle Rd., Stony Brook, NY 11790-3409; Jahan.reza@dec.ny.gov; or by phone at 631-444-0242.

Learning lab opens
for kindergartners
Oceanside School No. 6 opened a new lab for its kindergarten students last week after receiving a $250,000 state grant, according to state Sen. Todd Kaminsky's office.
The lab, known as SMILES or "Six's Magical Innovation Learning and Exploration Space," features a virtual playground, a touch-screen play table, a "selfie" station and a 3-D printer, a news release from Kaminsky's office states.
"This learning lab is a game-changer and it's already begun to work its magic," said Julie McGahan, principal of the school's prekindergarten and kindergarten center, in the release. "Our staff's creativity has been in the stratosphere because this space and its tools allow so much flexibility in how we design our curriculum."
Kaminsky secured the grant, the release stated.
"Oceanside School District is a vibrant community and an incredible place to raise a family," Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) said in the release.

Zoning amended for
senior unit driveway
The Huntington Town Board approved amending conditions of a zoning change approval for a driveway at a senior community proposed for Commack.
A condition that had been required in 2016 to allow a residential health services zone change for Commack based-Gurwin Jewish Geriatric Foundation has been removed.
The proposed senior community of 237 units on 10.47 acres, next to an existing assistant living facility and nursing home, is no longer required to have a Commack Road driveway align with Laurinda Drive on the east side of Commack Road. The requirement was part of the town's conditional approval after comments by the Suffolk County Department of Public Works.
County Department of Public Works officials recently said the alignment was no longer necessary, town officials said.
The board voted 5-0 at the May 1 town board meeting to approve the amendment.

Full text: CENTRAL ISLIP
Arson squad investigating
fire at vacant house
The Suffolk County police Arson Squad is investigating a fire that destroyed a vacant home in Central Islip early Tuesday, officials said.
"It was a total loss," Central Islip Fire Chief Patrick Murphy said. "The Town of Islip condemned the building and knocked it down."
Murphy said the fire started about 3:40 a.m. at a one-story single-family wood frame house on South Road. No injuries were reported.
Murphy said that when firefighters arrived at the scene, "It was fully involved with heavy fire to the rear of the house, and there ended up being a roof collapse."
It was not known whether anyone was inside the house when the fire started or whether anyone had been living there, Murphy said.
He said it took about two hours to bring the blaze under control, with his 45 firefighters aided by others from Hauppauge, East Islip, Islip Terrace and East Brentwood.
The chief noted one of the main challenges with the fire was trying to knock it down in such cold weather.
"Our guys did a great job in the cold weather - freezing conditions - and the mutual aid department assisted very well," Murphy said.

Oceanside
Teen, 17, faces felony DWI with 15-year-old passenger
A Rockville Centre teen was charged with felony drunken driving after a crash Monday in Oceanside with a 15-year-old boy riding in the backseat of the car, Nassau County police said.
There were no injuries.
The car's driver, Ryan Powers, 17, of Chestnut Street was charged under Leandra's Law with aggravated driving while intoxicated, endangering the welfare of a child and driving while intoxicated, police said.
He was scheduled for arraignment Tuesday at First District Court in Hempstead, but further details were not immediately available.
According to police, a 911 call was received shortly before 6:30 Monday night reporting a crash on Oceanside Road.
When officers arrived at the scene they found a 2005 Nissan Maxima sideways in the middle of the street with the driver, Powers, out of the car nearby.
"The officers observed the defendant to have bloodshot eyes and slurred speech and smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage," a police news release said.
Police said that after Powers was arrested, he was taken to a hospital for evaluation. The 15-year-old was released to a relative.
A police spokesman said Powers had been involved in a crash with another car that was also at the scene when police were called.
No additional details of the crash were immediately available.

RIVERHEAD
Burglary charge for man
caught Christmas morning
A man caught in the act of stealing from a barbershop in Riverhead on Christmas morning has been charged, police said.
Jose Maysonet, 52, was charged with one count of third-degree burglary. Information about where May sonet lives was not immediately available.
Riverhead Town police said a 911 call came in short ly before noon Monday reporting that a man was attempting to break into Eddy's Hi Class Dominican Barber Shop on Griffing Avenue.
According to a news release, the responding officers said they found Maysonet "exiting the Barber Shop with proceeds taken from within the business." Police did not release information about what was allegedly taken.- Lisa Irizarry

Football preview: Which team will rise to top in competitive Nassau III?: Any one of the top five teams - Lawrence, Roosevelt, Wantagh, Plainedge and Bethpage - could prevail in the conference

Full text: Ah, the two-minute drill in football. It can be the ultimate test of any player's nerves and resilience.
One can expect the Nassau III football playoffs to come down to some last-second heroics in what is believed to be the most competitive conference in 2017.
Six of the 10 games between the top five teams, Lawrence, Roosevelt, Wantagh, Plainedge and Bethpage came down to the final possession during the regular season.
"Any one of those top five teams can win our conference," Plainedge coach Rob Shaver said. "It's a really strong conference and it's unpredictable - everyone has had big wins against top teams. We lost to the three and four seeded teams and beat the one and two, so go figure."
Plainedge (6-2) will host Bethpage (5-3) at 2 p.m. on Saturday. These teams are both good enough to be county champions. It is the marquee game of the week.
Plainedge quarterback Mike Ciuffo has mastered the two-minute drill. He orchestrated two last-minute drives to beat Wantagh 17-14 and Lawrence 38-34. He has spread the ball around nicely to wide receivers Michael Harding, Brian Bornkamp and Joe Yarusso, who all have more than 25 catches.
"It takes a special player to maintain his composure in times of stress," Shaver said. "Any one of these games could be determined on the last possession. And it'll be all about the execution."
Bethpage quarterback Jason Seiter has been equally impressive. The Golden Eagles came back to beat Plainedge, 28-21, as Seiter hit Frank Ragusa for two touchdowns and fullback Jack Raia added two short scoring runs.
"He's one of the best in our conference," Shaver said. "He throws well and runs well so we need to maintain coverage and not allow him to run around much because he'll extend plays."
Plainedge was shut out in the second half the last time the Red Devils played Bethpage.
"We're going to have to eliminate the big plays," Shaver said. "There were big change of possessions in that second half. Seiter threw a touchdown pass on fourth-and-17 and we threw two interceptions and fumbled a third-quarter kickoff."
West Babylon at East Islip, Saturday, 2 p.m.: A healthy halfback Justin Taveras gives East Islip (5-3) a much-needed boost in Suffolk III. The Redmen were beaten by West Babylon (6-2) in the first meeting this season, 20-13. The Eagles defense didn't allow an offensive touchdown. Taveras' 90-yard kickoff return was the only TD. West Babylon quarterback Mark Esposito is a dual threat. He threw for 705 yards and ran for another 630.
Clarke at Locust Valley, Saturday, 4 p.m.: These teams met last week and Clarke forged a 27-26 win to qualify for the Nassau IV postseason. The Rams (3-5) will be forced to beat Locust Valley (5-3) two weeks in a row. Austin Carman-Lyons had two second-half touchdown runs as the Falcons took a 27-20 lead. But it took a blocked extra point by Kyle Kandel to push the Falcons into the postseason. Locust Valley has lost two in a row.
Harborfields at Sayville, Friday, 6 p.m.: This game features a matchup of two quality quarterbacks, who can sling it in Suffolk III. P.J. Clementi has thrown for 973 yards and 10 touchdowns, including nine to his favorite target in wide receiver Gavin Buda, for the Tornadoes. Sayville quarterback Jacob Cheshire returned after sitting out Week 7 with a shoulder injury. He threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-27 win over Islip, which had won four in a row, in last week's season finale.
Carey at Elmont, Saturday, 2:30 p.m.: Elmont's All-Long Island wide receiver Chester Anderson has been unstoppable with 806 yards receiving and 11 touchdowns in Nassau II. But the Spartans do not want another shootout with Carey. The Seahawks dumped Elmont, 49-27, earlier this season behind quarterback Dom Rutigliano, who has thrown more than anyone in Nassau with 242 attempts for 1,319 yards and 14 touchdowns. Carey needs to slow Elmont's Michael Djalo, who has rushed for 1,079 yards and 14 touchdowns.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Three Long Island teenagers are among 25 high school seniors across the state nominated for the 2018 U.S. Presidential Scholars Program, state education officials announced.
Christian Hernandez of MacArthur High School in Levittown, Cory H. Nichols of Oceanside High School and Mariah Wittschack of Eastport-South Manor Junior-Senior High School were selected for consideration. All are 17.
"The distinguished nominees are representative of the many talented high school students across our state," Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia said in announcing the nominees last week.
Ultimately, one young man and one young woman from each state are selected as U.S. presidential scholars - a recognition considered one of the nation's highest honors for high school students.
Eligibility is based on three paths of accomplishment: academic achievement; academic and artistic scholarship in the visual arts, the performing arts or creative writing; and outstanding scholarship in the career and technical education fields.
In New York, the head of the state Education Department nominates students for the federal recognition after students have been recommended by local legislators, according to state officials. How the legislators select students can vary, and many reach out to local high schools for suggestions.
Kristina Cuomo, English teacher at the Gerald R. Claps Career and Technical Center - a program in the Levittown schools - said Hernandez is someone who "goes above and beyond for his peers."
Hernandez of Seaford studies electrical technology at the center and plans to major in chemical and electrical engineering. He is a competitive swimmer and involved in several clubs at the school.
Hernandez credits the school for his success. "The people here are amazing," he said.
Nichols of Oceanside was named an academic and arts nominee. He founded a nonprofit called C the Difference: Cory Cares in 2012. Since then, he has raised more than $60,000 to help feed families and delivered tens of thousands of pounds of food to those in need.
"I love seeing the effect that it has on other people's lives and how easy it is to get other people involved in giving back," Nichols said in an interview Friday.
Earlier this year, he was one of five honorees nationwide for the 2017 Young Adult Caring Award from the nonprofit Caring Institute for "exemplifying selfless service to those in need," the organization said.
Wittschack of Manorville studies nursing through a program offered by Eastern Suffolk BOCES. She also is a youth volunteer with Manorville Community Ambulance.
Her father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was 7, she said, and she saw firsthand how nurses help not only patients but their families, too.
"It is really cool to give back," she said.
Semifinalists will be notified in mid-April, with those chosen as presidential scholars notified in May.
U.S. presidential scholars receive a trip to Washington, D.C., in June and are awarded the U.S. Presidential Scholars medallion at a ceremony sponsored by the White House.

Full text: Can Westhampton's Dylan Laube improve on his spectacular junior season? That daunting task begins Friday at 6 p.m. when the third-seeded Hurricanes host No. 6 Bellport in the Suffolk III opener.
Laube, a Newsday All-Long Island selection, scored 40 touchdowns in 2016, including four kick returns, and rushed for 2,152 yards, 11 of them on runs of more than 45 yards. Laube, who committed to play football at New Hampshire, presents a real challenge for the Clippers, who move down from Suffolk II, where they went 8-2 last season.
Other noteworthy openers in the first full week of Long Island football:
Nassau I
Oceanside at Massapequa, Saturday, 2 p.m. - Top-seeded Oceanside returns seven offensive starters, led by quarterback Tyler Heuer and wide receiver Dylan Judd.
Long Beach at Hempstead, Saturday, 2 p.m. - Hempstead hopes to end a nine-year playoff drought after finishing 4-4 the last two years. The Tigers are led by Dashawn Meadors, a Division I recruit at running back and linebacker.
Nassau III
Lynbrook at Bethpage, Saturday, 2 p.m. - Lynbrook looks to return to the playoffs after its 10-year streak ended last season. Both teams emphasize the running game.
Suffolk I
Ward Melville (1-0) at Connetquot (1-0), Saturday, 7 p.m. - Both teams opened with solid victories last week. Ward Melville beat Central Islip, 41-0, as Nick Messina rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns in the first half.

Suffolk III
Rocky Point at Sayville, Saturday, 2 p.m. - Sayville has a new look everywhere. Four-year starting quarterback Jack Coan is at Wisconsin, first-year coach Reade Sands replaces Rob Hoss who retired from coaching after a highly successful 15-year run, and the Golden Flashes unveil a new turf field near the railroad station.

Attendees will be able to browse the exhibits at 7 p.m. and ask questions to Driscoll and Antonia Petrash, author of the 2013 book "Long Island and the Women's Suffrage Movement."
Admission is free Tuesday night. The usual hours for the museum are 2 to 6 p.m. Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays and by appointment. Admission is free for members and children 12 and under, $5 for adults, and $4 for seniors and for young people ages 13 to 17.
The July 26, 2016, council meeting also was held at the museum, as part of an effort to increase residents' knowledge of city history amid early planning for the 2018 celebrations marking the 350th anniversary of Glen Cove's founding.- DAVID OLSON

Missing the golden era of LI racing

Full text:   Missing the golden era of Long Island racing
The closing of racetracks over the years has cost Long Island a big part of its heritage. William Kissam Vanderbilt II built the Long Island Motor Parkway in 1904 for the first major road-racing competition. Later in the century, hobbyists and fans could go to nine local tracks. Islip Speedway (closed in 1984), the Bridgehampton Race Circuit (closed in 1998) and Long Island Dragway in Westhampton (closed in 2004) were just a few.
Not only have the anti-racing people destroyed a passionate pastime, they've also put a dent in the local economy. Many speed shops that did after-market work on cars are gone. Hobbyists from Long Island must go out of state to race.
Politicians and the people who moved next to the tracks have rendered local racing all but extinct - save for the much-diminished Riverhead Raceway. People should have done research before they moved to those places.
The hours I spent rebuilding my muscle car in my driveway kept me out of trouble. Today, instead of kids wrenching on a racecar, learning and bonding, they waste time with Xbox and PlayStation video games.

Oceanside's streets need maintenance
I've lived in Oceanside for 50 years, and although our taxes are so high, I feel the street maintenance is inadequate. No one picks up the litter. No one cuts grass along the streets. Through calls and letters, I've advised Town of Hempstead authorities from sanitation to elected officials, to no avail. I wish those in a position to fix this would stand up and do so.

Nutritious recognition for cops, firefighters
On Sept. 11, my husband and I went to Jam, a restaurant in Massapequa Park.
We were very surprised when our waitress presented us with the "bill." She knew my husband is a volunteer firefighter, and that day - unknown to us - fire and police personnel were given free meals as a thanks for their service. That was what was written on the bill!

Abstract: CONDITION The Carryall sports a bunch of newer modifications, including a Chevrolet grille, 350-cubic-inch engine and automatic transmission, power disc brakes and steering, a digital dash and Chevrolet Tahoe leather seats.

Full text:   THE CAR AND ITS OWNER
1963 GMC Suburban Carryall panel truck owned by Bob Nowakowski
WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING
Long before trucks were loaded with interiors and amenities befitting luxury cars, this Carryall would get your cargo from Point A to Point B with simplicity, confidence and style. And it's a vehicle steeped in the history of General Motors' truck division. The GMC brand dates back to 1912 and the first Suburban, considered by many the granddaddy of today's SUVs, debuted in 1935. Today, vintage GMC trucks and their sister models from Chevrolet often find their way into the garages of customizers for special paint treatments and mechanical upgrades. "This GMC panel is one of the very few that you will find around," says Nowakowski.
HOW LONG HE'S OWNED IT
Since 2014
WHERE HE FOUND IT
He bought it from a New Jersey owner.
CONDITION
The Carryall sports a bunch of newer modifications, including a Chevrolet grille, 350-cubic-inch engine and automatic transmission, power disc brakes and steering, a digital dash and Chevrolet Tahoe leather seats. "When it was cleaned up, it really showed well," says Nowakowski. "It is striped in and out, the interior is detailed with red carpet on the floor, walls and ceiling, and there are big musical notes on the rear interior walls. I did not do any of the work myself. I just put in a new battery, alternator and brake job when I got it."
TIPS FOR OWNERS
"Buy something done (restored), that is comfortable and runs well, and drive the heck out of it," he advises. "They look pretty in the garage, but great on the road."
VALUE
Nowakowski has insured the GMC for $27,000.
THE BOTTOM LINE
"I think this truck is special because it has a combo of GMC and Chevrolet parts," he says. "I have had a lot of 'head- turner' cars and trucks. I didn't think this would be one as I bought it mostly for the comfort, but I was wrong. It draws a lot of attention and I have had many offers for it in the short time I have owned it."

Pray tell about prayer plant

Author: Damiano, Jessica

Abstract: None available.

Full text: DEAR JESSICA: My partner and I have had this supermarket-bought prayer plant in our living room for about 21/2 years. It is beautiful to look at and has thrived on benign neglect with the exception of one transplant about a year ago. It has grown to about 36 inches across and 30 inches high. Last week, we noticed a "growth" unlike the other leaves coming from the middle. Can it be flowering? - Mark Stine, Oceanside
DEAR MARK: Prayer plants flower regularly when growing outdoors in their native tropical climate. As you are witnessing, they put forth single white flowers atop long stems.
The fact that your indoor plant is blooming in Oceanside is testament to the quality of care and the environment you are providing. Prayer plants thrive best in a warm, humid environment, out of direct sunlight, with even, consistent soil moisture. My hunch is you also are fertilizing it regularly (roughly twice a month) during spring and summer. Well done!
DEAR JESSICA: When is the best time to prune butterfly bushes and ornamental grasses? - Warren Tackenberg, via email
DEAR WARREN: Ornamental grasses can be cut to the ground anytime between autumn, after they have gone dormant, and spring, before growth resumes. Cutting during spring is ideal, however, because if left in place, dormant top growth will serve as a bit of protection to roots over winter.
Butterfly bush, however, should only be cut down in late winter or early spring (February to March). You can, however, remove single stray branches or trim the length of stems, if unwieldy, during spring or summer.
DEAR JESSICA: A few squirrels enjoyed my tomatoes, both green and red, last summer! Is there any way to discourage them? - Nora Ehrling, Rockville Centre
DEAR NORA: Ugh, squirrels! Those little critters sabotaged my pear crop for so many years in a row that I gave up, cut the tree down and made the deck bigger to replace it. And the worst part is that with tomatoes - as well as pears - they seem to take just one bite before abandoning the fruit for another, like a small child with a box of chocolates. Unlike a child, though, you can hardly ever catch them in the act, so they keep repeating the behavior until your entire crop is ruined.
Squirrels typically show interest in ripe tomatoes, but they have been known to take green ones right off the plant. If you're seeing bite or peck marks in tomatoes still on the plant, chances are you're dealing with a bird problem. And the challenge with a bird or a squirrel problem is that it isn't easily remedied.
Anecdotally, I've heard stories of folks applying hot chili powder or other repellents around plants, while others claim success by providing a food source nearby that squirrels prefer to tomatoes - but not so close that they'll feast on both. You might try setting out a feeder full of sunflower or bird seeds about 20 feet from your patch in hopes they'll fill up on that and leave your tomatoes alone.
The only surefire deterrent is a barrier, but it's also the most labor intensive. Chicken wire works, as does bird netting (if wrapped around a support that surrounds entire plants or groups of plants, allowing enough space between net and plants to make it impossible for the little thieves to reach the fruit of your labor.)
Or you can get a dog.

Ava Gabbe of Oceanside really wanted to spend her 12th birthday eating pizza, making terrariums and eating cake with 12 of her friends from school.
But when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a ban on public gatherings to stop the spread of COVID-19, her mom canceled it.
"She was devastated," her mother Michelle Gabbe said. "She loves getting together with her friends."
On Saturday, Michelle got a text from one of her fellow mom friends to stand outside their Cleveland Avenue home with Ava at 5 p.m.
The Gabbes went outside to see a parade of about 10 cars lined up outside their house beeping their horns and a group of screaming sixth-grade girls with handmade cards and balloons.
Gabbe said her neighbors came out to see what all the ruckus was about and the whole street sang "Happy Birthday" to Ava.
Ava was so happy and was "jumping up and down," her mom said. "This was just over-the-top. This was fabulous."
Ethan Mancuso, also of Oceanside, was "floored" to see the same celebration outside his house after he was sad that his 10th birthday party at SkyZone with 15 of his friends was canceled because of the virus outbreak.
"He was really looking forward to it," said his mother Alyssa Mancuso, who works as a guidance counselor at Nassau BOCES in the special education department.
She received a text from a friend to stand outside her house with Ethan at 6:30 p.m. Sunday.
"They're honking, they had silly string, streamers, balloons," she said. "I was hysterical, crying."
Mancuso said Ethan was so surprised, "that just made his day."
"It was a struggle because you want to go and give them hugs and thank them but you couldn't. We had to stand on our front stoop and blow them kisses from there," Mancuso said of the social distancing guidelines that require individuals to be at least 6 feet apart to minimize the spread of the virus.
The organizer behind the "drive-by birthday parties" was friend Theresa Henriquez, whose daughter is one of Ava's friends.
It started off with a drive to deliver handmade cards for Ava on her birthday, but Henriquez thought, "Why don't we get in our cars and honk horns and wish her a happy birthday?"
In an effortless group text with other moms of Ava's friends, they all planned the celebration in less than a day. She said it was easy to plan because "everyone was on board."
"We made quite the ruckus," Henriquez said. "There's nothing like making a kid feel special on their birthday."
She said she has three more requests next month for more drive-by birthday celebrations.
Both moms say they still plan to make it up to their children and have a big birthday party later in the year.
"This could be a trend. Even after this pandemic that we're dealing with, this might be something we might implement more," Gabbe said.

Cases down, but it feels 'bittersweet': As hospital begins its return to normalcy, lingering effects of coronavirus a concern

Author: Olson, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Although the number of COVID-19 patients at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital has fallen to levels not seen since the beginning of the state's March 22 stay-at-home order, the anguish caused by the pandemic endures, as people recovering from the disease continue to struggle at home, and patients who arrived during the pandemic's peak remain weeks later, clinging to life on ventilators.
Crews are busy disinfecting rooms to make them safe for people without COVID-19. But many continue to avoid the hospital, for fear of contracting the coronavirus, and health care workers worry about another spike in cases.
South Nassau, like other hospitals across Long Island, is returning to some semblance of normalcy after an influx of hundreds of COVID-19 patients during the apex in early and mid-April threatened to overwhelm front-line workers at the Oceanside hospital.
weblink_hosppix
The intensive care unit, which had nearly quadrupled in size to handle the surge of gravely ill people, had 72 COVID-19 patients on several days in early April, but only five on Thursday.
Yet, intensive-care nurse educator Katie DeMelis said, "It's bittersweet. Our numbers are down, but they didn't all leave the way we wanted them to."
By Thursday, 399 people had died of COVID-19 at the hospital, and nearly 4,000 had perished across Long Island. 
LIHOSPITAL200524e_video
More now at the hospital likely will die of the disease, DeMelis said as she stood in a hallway outside the room of an unconscious man under heavy sedation who was only alive because of a ventilator that produced the breaths his body could not. The man's prognosis is poor, she said.
"We had five expirations on [May 17] alone from this unit," DeMelis said. "It was not unexpected. Unfortunately, a lot of these patients are at end of life, so they're actively dying or they're going to be long-term care at this point," living without mental awareness and only with the 24/7 help of machines.
Newsday visited South Nassau on May 18 and 19 to see how the drop in COVID-19 patients had changed the hospital, and to examine the toll the disease has taken on patients and employees. During a mid-April visit, the hospital had nearly 500 patients, far above the typical 340. Patients with COVID-19 and those suspecting of having the disease occupied more than three in four beds and flummoxed doctors and nurses with inexplicable symptoms and sometimes a rapid spiral toward death.
On Thursday, one in five of South Nassau's 276 patients had COVID-19.
Doctors worry that the abnormally low number of non-COVID-19 patients means some Long Islanders are suffering needlessly at home or dying, because they still are afraid of getting infected with the coronavirus at the hospital.
"We're going to end up having this whole group of people that are hurt, who never had COVID, but they're going to be hurt by COVID," said Dr. Adhi Sharma, chief medical officer of South Nassau.
With fewer patients, employees are visibly less stressed. Yet they confront the emotional aftermath of seeing so much death in so short a time.
In April, as many as 17 people a day were dying of COVID-19, overloading South Nassau's small morgue and spurring the hospital to buy three 40-foot trailers to store corpses. There were 69 bodies in the trailers on April 20. On Wednesday, there were eight, and only one of the three trailers hummed with the sound of a refrigeration system that keeps bodies cold until backlogged funeral homes and cemeteries can pick them up.
Oceanside woman: 'I feel like I have leprosy'
Debbie Rifenbury is one of the ICU success stories. She left South Nassau on April 20 after 17 days, including six in the ICU.
She was ecstatic when she was discharged and returned to the Oceanside home she shares with her boyfriend, Michael Miller, 46, and his mother. A month later, she said she's "very depressed."
Her breathing is improving, but the progress is achingly slow, Rifenbury said. A recent achievement was walking up and down the driveway three times, and then down two houses to the corner and back. The exertion left her winded.
"My lungs are still messed up," she said.
Rifenbury said some family and friends don't call her as often. She thinks they're afraid of her.
"I feel like I have leprosy," said Rifenbury, who, after her doctor told her May 19 she was no longer contagious, finally was able to hug Miller.
Dr. Frank Coletta, the chief of critical care medicine at South Nassau, said even though Rifenbury is gradually getting better, "When you wake up every day and don't see a lot of improvement, you get frustrated."
Rifenbury illustrates how devastating COVID-19 can be to the lungs.
Most people with non-COVID-19 pneumonia regain full function of their lungs, Coletta said. COVID-19 is too new a disease to know the long-term prognosis of patients like Rifenbury, but, Coletta said, "The expectation is these patients will have a much tougher recovery down the road."
Anthony Greco, 53, a retired NYPD officer who spent 61 days at South Nassau and The Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, has, like Rifenbury, an unclear path ahead, Coletta said.
Doctors had to remove one-sixth of his right lung because it was infected and inflamed. "We'll expect some decrease in lung function just from that," Coletta said.
Greco, a member of the Wantagh school district board, felt sick March 11 and teetered back and forth between mild and more severe symptoms until "I couldn't breathe. Then I knew I was in big trouble."
LIHOSPITAL200524_video
Still, he was able to walk to the car that his wife, Elizabeth Greco, 54, drove to South Nassau. She dropped him off at 11 a.m. on March 21, expecting to take him home within two days. Instead, two hours later she got a phone call that his condition dramatically worsened and he was being put on a ventilator. Doctors told Elizabeth Greco he may not make it through the night.
The disease is maddeningly unpredictable, said Coletta, who has seen patients he thought would recover suddenly deteriorate and die.
Greco beat the odds.
"My voice is still not back," he said from his hospital bed May18, hoarse because his vocal cords are still recovering from the strain of having an endotracheal tube between them. "But my breathing's getting better."
Two days later, he was discharged to the rapturous applause of dozens of members of his extended family and hospital employees.
Elizabeth Greco, barred from visiting her husband in the hospital, said a day later that she was "over the moon" as she hugged him.
"He's a real, real miracle," she said.
Number of ventilators tripled
To handle the influx of patients like Greco with severe respiratory problems, South Nassau had to more than triple the number of ventilators it had, from 40 to 128.
Iris Halem, the respiratory manager, pointed to more than two dozen ventilators that sat wrapped in plastic, temporarily not needed post-surge.
"I'm going to keep everything until we get a vaccine," she said.
Early studies concluded that most COVID-19 patients placed on ventilators died, but more recent studies, and reports from hospitals, indicate that most survive. 
Halem oversees respiratory therapists, who are critical to keeping COVID-19 patients alive, and had to scramble to find more as the number of cases at the hospital increased rapidly. Some came from out of state. Most have returned home. She said she's ready to redeploy them if there's a resurgence in cases. 
The hospital has other plans in place in case there is a second wave of cases, which some epidemiologists are predicting for the fall, Coletta said. It has a 90-day supply of machinery, personal protective equipment for employees and other resources, he said. Four tents erected to handle the first surge remain standing outside the hospital.
Hospital staff regularly talk of their fears of a new wave of infections, Coletta said.
"The concern is complacency," he said. "If everyone thinks this is all over and they can resume the prior activities they did, including not social distancing, that's a recipe for disaster."
The hospital "got to the precipice" during the April peak, and if there had been a few dozen more cases, it "would have broken us," Sharma said.
Dr. Joshua Kugler, chair of emergency medicine at the hospital, said that during the height of the crisis the emergency room was unable to separate COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients because people with COVID-19 overwhelmed the area, with beds in the hallways and seemingly every corner. Patients were tested, but it often took a week to get results.
Now, tests of ER patients are sent to an on-site lab, rather than to Manhattan or out of state, and results come back in one to two hours, he said. The emergency room separates those with the virus from those who test negative, with people awaiting test results in another area, wearing masks and staying at least 6 feet apart, he said.
On May 18, only seven of 40 ER patients were confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, Kugler said. They were isolated.
"We're trying to reintroduce the principle that the hospital is a safe place to be seen," he said.
Yet many people who need help avoid the emergency room, fearful they will contract the virus, he said.
Emergency room physician Dr. Musa Khan gestured toward an 86-year-old woman who had been complaining about pain for four days for what turned out to be a dislocated shoulder. Family members feared she would be exposed to the coronavirus in the emergency room, so they iced her shoulder and gave her Tylenol, finally calling an ambulance May 18 after her bruising and swelling got worse, Khan said.
Later that Monday, a young man arrived in the emergency room with a gash in his thigh from accidentally stabbing himself with garden shears.
"The patient's wife was very worried about him coming to the hospital" because of coronavirus fears, said Oceanside Fire Department paramedic Ross Feinman, who assured her he'd be safe.
Sharma said "this is the best time" for a non-COVID-19 patient to seek hospital care, before the number of COVID-19 cases potentially begins to rise again. He believes that a number of Long Islanders likely died of non-COVID-19 causes because they feared going to the hospital.
In addition, the state's two-month-old ban on elective surgeries - which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lifted for Nassau County on May 19, three days after he did so for Suffolk - caused delays in needed treatment, Sharma said. Cuomo stopped elective surgeries to ensure there were enough beds for COVID-19 patients.
Ban caused delays in treatments
In March, Dr. Jason Freeman, South Nassau's director of interventional cardiology, removed a 99% blockage in the main artery to the bottom of the heart of Helen Montano, 66, of Lynbrook. He saw during that procedure that another artery had an 85% blockage, but didn't believe the elective surgery ban allowed him to remove it as soon as he had wanted. Once Montano reported cardiac symptoms like shortness of breath, he scheduled the procedure.
Montano said May 18 as she rested after the successful procedure that the delay caused her to have "a lot of anxiety that it was going to get worse."
Dr. Rajiv Datta, the chairman of surgery, said that, until the number of COVID-19 patients declined, he avoided all but the most urgent surgeries because finding a COVID-free path through the hospital to the operating room "was very difficult."
In addition, he said, "We had no space, no staff, nothing. Four weeks ago, we were in such a dire state."
A surgery Datta performed May 19 to remove a growth from the neck of Roderick Middleton, 26, of Jamaica, Queens, was weeks later than it would have been, he said. The growth turned out to be a nonmalignant cyst, but Datta said there had been a small chance it had been cancer.
All surgery patients are tested for COVID-19, and Middleton tested negative, but, even so, everyone in the operating room donned an N95 mask.
Throughout the hospital, extra precautions have become routine, because some patients who test negative have later been found to be positive. In the heart catherization area, some recovery beds are not used, "just to err on the side of caution," so there is social distancing between patients, nurse Debbie Giannitsis said.

The hospital has taken a big financial hit from the COVID-19 crisis, losing $10.4 million between March 13 and April 30, chief financial officer John Pohlman said.
The resumption of elective surgeries, which generally earn more money for the hospital than COVID-19 treatment, will help stem the losses, said Richard Murphy, president and CEO of South Nassau. Nearly 1,200 operations were deferred because of the elective-surgery ban, he said.
Still, with the number of patients much lower than normal, the hospital expects to lose $12 million to $15 million a month in May, June and July, Pohlman said.
The hospital has received $75.1 million in federal stimulus money, he said. It is unclear whether the money will be enough to cover losses, hospital officials said.
Pace becomes less hectic
With the drop in patients, the pace of work for many employees has become less hectic. The double shifts and working for weeks with no day off are largely over. Yet that has given some employees more time to reflect on the horrors of COVID-19 they have witnessed.
DeMelis said during the peak of cases, "I was moving so fast, I didn't have time to think." Now, "All the thoughts are coming at me," and she often has trouble sleeping.
In addition, employees have been stressed out by the fear of infecting family members, said Janet Kahn-Scolaro, administrative director at South Nassau and a therapist. Of 629 South Nassau employees tested for the coronavirus, 224 tested positive, and three died of COVID-19, hospital officials said.
Some employees will develop post-traumatic stress disorder, Kahn-Scolaro predicted.
LIHOSPITAL200524_video
The hospital created a 24-hour hotline - staffed by licensed therapists - for employees and the public to help them deal with the emotional impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
Some employees did not want to bring home to loved ones what "we suffered through for weeks at a time that no one in health care has ever experienced," said Rita Regan, vice president for quality and care management.
"I mean, what's your husband going to say to you?: 'How was your day?' " she asked. "What's the answer to that? You can't possibly tell your family what your day was like, and it almost felt like you were shutting down. But you didn't want to relive it, and you didn't even want to take the time to think about what you had

Full text: The sole female employee of an Oceanside sanitation district alleged on Tuesday that she was sexually harassed by members of the district's all-male board of commissioners, and two of her colleagues said they were fired for sticking up for her.
The trio is filing separate complaints to the  state Division of Human Rights and notices of claims against Hempstead Town's Sanitary District No. 7, an independent municipal agency that collects trash in Oceanside, their attorney, Frederick Brewington, said on Tuesday.
The complaints also name as respondents the district's board of commissioners and the five individual commissioners, who were elected to the posts.
Board chairman John M. Mannone declined to comment Tuesday.
The woman, Jacqueline Urli, a secretary in the district, said in her complaint that the commissioners created a "hostile, toxic" work environment in which sexual harassment went unchecked.
Urli alleged that Commissioner Matthew S. Horowitz, in particular, displayed "revolting, creepy and disturbing" behavior toward her beginning in August 2018, including unwanted touching, suggesting that they "have a three-way" with another district employee and commenting on her appearance, according to the complaint. 
"It's not funny," she said Tuesday. "It's humiliating and embarrassing."
Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment.
Urli, who still works for the district, filed a written complaint in November to Daniel Faust, then the district's general supervisor, who presented the complaint to the board, Faust said Tuesday.
Around nine days later, the board fired Faust and district treasurer Douglas Hernandez at a Dec. 6 public board of commissioners meeting without explanation, Faust and Hernandez said Tuesday.
Both had offered to serve as witnesses to Urli's allegations, they said. They each had worked for the district for more than 20 years.
"They did what men should do," Brewington said of Hernandez and Faust, describing their termination as "an act of pure retaliation."
Urli said the commissioners also took away some of her duties after she filed her complaint, which she described as retaliatory.
Her complaint accuses the respondents of discrimination, sexual harassment, creating a hostile work environment and retaliatory employment practices under the  state Human Rights Law and the U.S. Civil Rights Act.
Brewington said the trio are seeking unspecified damages, the reinstatement of Hernandez and Faust to their positions and an agreement that the commissioners adopt a sexual harassment policy and take sexual harassment training. 
The district does not currently have any such policy or training procedures, U

DA: Man scammed $45G from woman, 81

Full text: A Bronx man was arraigned on grand larceny charges Thursday, three months after, prosecutors said, he stole $45,000 in cash from an Oceanside woman who thought she was handing over funds for her son's bail after the alleged scammer falsely told her the son had been arrested  for a drunken-driving crash.
Frederik Regalado, 23, was arraigned on an indictment before Nassau County Court Judge Meryl Berkowitz on three counts of third-degree grand larceny and was being held on $600,000 bond or $300,000 cash, according to a news release from Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas.
Regalado is due back in court April 4, court records show. Third-degree grand larceny is punishable by a prison term of 2-1/3 to 7 years, officials said.
His Legal Aid Society attorney  could not be reached for comment.
"This defendant allegedly took part in a cold-hearted scheme and stole $45,000 from an elderly woman who believed that her son was in trouble," Singas said. "When these types of scams are committed against seniors, it not only robs them of their dignity, but also of their peace of mind."
Prosecutors said Regalado anonymously called an 81-year-old Oceanside woman at 11 a.m. on Dec. 3 with a ruse. He  said her son had been arrested  for driving drunk after he was involved in a crash in Manhattan, authorities said. The caller, who prosecutors said was Regalado, said the court was asking for $7,500 in cash bail to secure his release.
Regalado, prosecutors said, visited the victim and collected the money - but called back at 3 p.m. that day and said the court demanded $7,500 more because the judge in the bogus case had increased the bail amount after the person  struck by the victim's son's car had lost her fetus in the crash.
Regalado then returned to the Oceanside home and collected another $7,500, prosecutors said.
Two hours later, about 5 p.m. "the caller stated that the woman had to send an additional $30,000 to pay for medical bills that were related to the car crash," officials said, adding that Regalado returned and collected another $30,000.
The scam was revealed when the victim's son called shortly after Regalado had left and she learned that her son was not involved in an accident, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are urging the public to beware of phone scams and to report any irregularities to the district attorney's office tip line at 516-571

drinks | IPA from LI brewery takes home top honor in state

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For the past few (mostly) frigid weeks, the Winter Garden inside New York City's Brookfield Place was transformed into a biergarten - and one night during each of those weeks, five brewers from New York State's various regions - the city, upstate and Long Island - competed in a rolling throwdown called Best Brews of New York. Each week, one brewery from each field advanced to a final showdown.
On March 14, Shadows and Dust, a hazy New England style-IPA from Oceanside's Barrier Brewing Co., was voted the Best Brew in New York by the thousand-plus visitors to the biergarten; Barrier prevailed over beers from Harlem Brewing Company, Bronx Brewery, Empire Brewing Co. (in Syracuse) and Captain Lawrence Brewing Company (also upstate, in Elmsford) to take home the top honor.
"When we started out in 2009, it was on a small scale with not nearly as much beer as we're making now," said Mike Descarfino, sales director for Barrier Brewing. "Winning this event puts things in perspective as to how far we've come. We're just super proud and humbled to have taken this victory."
Barrier Brewing was founded in 2009 by Craig Frymark and Evan Klein, one of the first breweries of Long Island's craft brewing boom. (Frymark has since left the company, and Klein is sole owner and brewmaster). Along the way, Barrier became especially known for its IPAs. In 2012, the brewery was inundated with 4 feet of water during Hurricane Sandy and closed for several months, said Descarfino. It was the generosity of other breweries - both here and upstate - that helped Barrier to weather the blow, he added.
In 2013, eight L.I. breweries converged at Blue Point Brewing Company in Patchogue to brew Surge Protector, a collaborative IPA that raised at least $58,000 for businesses and organizations impacted by Sandy, including Barrier Brewing. (In that spirit, Descarfino said, Barrier is taking part in its share of collaboration brews in recent years).
On Feb. 28, collaboration turned to friendly competition at Brookfield Place when Barrier competed against beers from Blue Point Brewing Company, Greenport Harbor Brewing Co., Oyster Bay Brewing Co. and Montauk Brewing Company. Crowd votes bumped Barrier into the final leg. [The L.I. brewing scene] has exploded, compared to where it was when I started," Descarfino said. (He has been with Barrier six years). "There's a lot of great beer being made on Long Island, and a lot of new young breweries coming up. It's definitely worth a trip out to the island for the weekend to see what Long Island has to offer."
Shadows and Dust is available in cans throughout the tristate area, and Barrier Brewing now distributes in six states; 12 beers are always on tap in its Oceanside tap room.

HEMPSTEAD TOWN: $2.5M BOND OKD IN TRUCK CRASH

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hempstead Town Board members passed a $2.5 million bond to cover a settlement to a driver who was injured during a 2013 crash with a town sand truck in Oceanside.
The board unanimously voted on Nov. 13 to approve the settlement to be paid to Danny J. Miller and Josephine Miller for the Feb. 3, 2013, crash.
Danny Miller's box work truck was struck by a Hempstead Town highway truck on Long Beach Road at West Windsor Parkway after the town driver ran through a red light, Miller's Garden City-based attorney Joseph Dell said.
Miller was heading to a job in Oceanside when the highway truck made an illegal U-turn and struck Miller's truck at a four-way intersection, Dell said. It was not snowing at the time, and the truck was sanding the road.
Miller was seriously injured in the crash, needed to use a wheelchair and was unable to speak, Town Attorney Joe Ra said during the meeting. His wife, Josephine Miller, was not in the truck at the time of the collision. Hempstead officials did not identify the town employee and could not be reached for further comment.
Miller suffered several orthopedic injuries and later had a stroke due to blood clots, limiting his ability to speak and causing neurological impairments, Dell said.
In a news brief about the accident, Newsday reported that the Oceanside Fire Department used rescue equipment to free the box truck driver. The sand truck driver was evaluated but was not taken to a hospital, the article said.  
A jury in a Nassau Supreme Court civil trial found on Sept. 28 that the town was 100 percent liable for the crash and Miller's injuries, Dell said. The town then offered to settle damages for pain and suffering at $2.5 million.
"It exposed them to a verdict that if the jury believed the stroke was related to the accident, Mr. Miller could have been awarded in excess of $3-$4 millio

Woman accused of mom's murder cites mental illness
An Oceanside lawyer pleaded not responsible for stabbing her mother to death, due to mental illness, attorneys said on Tuesday.
The Office of the Nassau District Attorney confirmed the plea by Suzan Grossman-Kerner, who had been charged with the murder of her mother, Irma Grossman, 79, in August 2015.
"This is one of the top heart-wrenching cases; when somebody kills their mother, there has to be real, real mental illness here," her lawyer, Todd D. Greenberg, said by telephone.
Grossman-Kerner "was a successful attorney, with three kids, and a good job - and she snapped," he said, noting her husband, also an attorney, has stood by her.
Her collapse began after superstorm Sandy in 2012 destroyed some of her belongings, said Greenberg, who documented his client's psychiatric history in a presentation before Acting state Supreme Court Justice Meryl J. Berkowitz.
"She grew depressed, delusional, dysfunctional; the mental illness, as her doctor said, 'took a severe, unrelenting mental course,' " her attorney said.
As a patient at Zucker Hillside Hospital, Grossman-Kerner underwent 40 electroconvulsive therapy treatments, he said.
"And she felt that harmed her," Greenberg said.
"Basically, she blamed her mother and her husband for the particular treatment she received," he said.
Glen Oaks-based Zucker Hillside Hospital is part of Northwell Health. Citing patient confidentiality laws, a Northwell spokesman declined to comment.
On Aug. 17, 2015, Grossman-Kerner went to her mother's Terrell Avenue home in Oceanside, where the two argued over "her daughter's ongoing medical conditions," police said.
She was arrested at the scene and then charged with murder in the second degree.

WOODMERE
Man accused of embezzling
$3 million over 14 years
Nassau police on Tuesday arrested a Selden man whom they accused of embezzling more than $3 million from his employer over a 14-year period, officials said.
Peter Singh, 43, of Riviera Drive was arraigned later in the day on second-degree grand larceny, first-degree scheme to defraud and first-degree falsifying business records at First District Court in Hempstead Tuesday. He is due back in court May 25, officials said.
Singh's attorney, Scott Limmer of Mineola, could not be reached for comment.
Robbery Squad detectives said Singh used his position as practice administrator at Pediatric Healthcare of Long Island in Woodmere to access payroll and bank accounts, and he steered direct deposits amounting to $83,500 and a pay raise of up to $1,126,800 to his own bank account.
Police said he also added the names of his wife and stepdaughter to the payroll and authorized transfers of funds of $1,726,700 and $136,053 for them, respectively, but had the funds directed into his account.
Finally, police said, Singh set up a bogus company and directed $29,600 to it, but the funds went to him.
Detectives said the scheme took place from 2004 until this past February, amounting to more than $3 million in thefts and that Singh's actions were revealed when the company hired an accountant to analyze its financial records.
An official at Pediatric Healthcare of Long Island said the doctors at the firm declined to comment.- ZACHARY R. DOWDY

Full text: Jackie Tohn is basking in the after-"GLOW."
"There's a big, huge, monstrous 'GLOW' billboard in Times Square right now and that had me tearing up this morning," marvels Oceanside born-and-raised Tohn, who stars as Melanie "Melrose" Rosen in the Netflix seriocomedy about 1980s women wrestlers, loosely based on the real-life Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. After an acclaimed first season last summer, it returns Friday with pre-release reviews that are just as slammin'.
And Tohn couldn't be more gratified and amazed that she and the series - starring Alison Brie and Betty Gilpin as former friends sundered by betrayal, who now must work together in the ring - are at The Crossroads of the World. "That was a dream I really never let myself dream, being on a billboard in Times Square," says the comedian-actress-singer, 37. "That was, like, too big a dream to feel attainable, that maybe this career wouldn't ever happen for me. I've been at this since I was 9 and now I'm on a billboard in Times Square and I was like, 'Hey! It happened!' "
At the end of the 10-episode first season, the GLOW gals had just shot their first televised match and seemed poised for at least local-market success. But the upcoming season sees the (fictional) "GLOW" series within the (real-life) "GLOW" series in danger of cancellation, usurped in its time slot by a men's wrestling show. What to do? As director and impresario Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron) puts it, "Set the weirdos free and see what happens."
"Melrose in season 2 is still a wiseass who definitely always wants to be the center of attention," Tohn says of her character. "In season 1 she was really out for herself. There was nothing she wouldn't do to further her own gain within the team and her own, like, kind of 'cool' factor. I think in season 2 she still has a mouth, but she's much more of a team player. And she uses her full overzealousness, her ideas and her sort of producer brain . Like, you look at a criminal sometimes and you're like, 'God, if you could just use your brains for good!"
Since production wrapped last season, the 1998 Oceanside High grad, whose retired parents, Bella and Alan, still live in Oceanside, has performed in numerous Southern California comedy-club shows, preferring it to solo gigs on the road. "It was my bread and butter," she says of stand-up comics' hard-grind touring life. "And now it's, like, to go back to the rental cars and the snow and Upper Peninsula Michigan - no, boy!"
She's also completed roles in two upcoming independent features. In "Spell," she appears in flashback as the dead girlfriend of a man (Barak Hardley) with mental issues who makes a journey of discovery in Iceland. Then there's "Elsewhere," in which she plays the sensible potential love interest of a widower (Aden Young) in a rural Pacific Northwest town who is drawn to a free-spirited newcomer (Parker Posey). Tohn also co-starred with Heather Pasternak in a roughly 4-minute "Broad City"-like Web comedy short, "Are We Okay?," which she dismisses as something "I made with some friends in, like, 2015, that I guess they're putting out now."
Tohn, who was one of 36 semifinalists in the eighth season of "American Idol" in 2009 and appeared in Bravo's singer-songwriter competition "Platinum Hit" two years later, also has a five-track EP due out July 27.
But wait! There's more! "I'm hoping to get my one-woman show up and running in New York and L.A.," she says. "I did one in New York in 2014 and then came out to L.A. in 2015 and started working a lot more, so I definitely want to get back to my live-stage, crazy-lady, solo-show roots."
And even though it's a phone interview, you can just sense that Tohn is positively glowing.

Meet highlights cystic fibrosis awareness: Eight teams competed and raised money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a charity that hits home for Cold Spring Harbor coach Teri Kindelmann

Full text: Usually at a gymnastics meet, the air is filled with chalk and competitiveness.
But Monday, Cold Spring Harbor vibrated with positive energy during the fourth annual Cartwheels for a Cure meet.
Eight teams competed and raised money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a charity that hits home for CSH Coach Teri Kindelmann. Her daughters, 7-year-old Matison and 5-year-old Charlotte, both have cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and other organs.
"This is our fourth year and it has grown from two teams to eight," CSH coach Teri Kindelmann said. "Everyone in the competition is now aware of my daughters and we're bringing awareness to cystic fibrosis. I think it's great for the gymnast to interact with my girls and know why they are here."
Bethpage coach Kim Rhatigan also reminded the gymnast why there were there in her opening speech.
"Today is Martin Luther King Day and I want you girls to know there's more to life then Netflix," Rhatigan said. "Being apart of Cartwheel for a Cure is about helping others and putting others before yourself."
The gymnast did just that raising about $4000 in donations.
On the competition side, Plainview-Old Bethpage placed first (172.50) lead by Miranda Lund and Jessica Lopez.
Lund placed first in the All-Around (38.150), Vault (9.550), Uneven Bars (9.550) and Floor (9.6). She placed second on Beam (9.450).
"We did our best for a great cause," Lund said. "The competition has grown so much. Everyone knows the girls and we are all happy to be here and happy to help."
Lopez placed third in the All-Around (35.3) and second on Floor (9.5).
"I think this entire meet is so unique," Lopez said. "Not a lot of sports do something like this . . . we get to do something that we all really love for such a great cause and it just makes the event more amazing."
Massapequa placed second led by Gillian Murphy, who placed third in Floor (9.45) and tied for second on Vault (9.1). Cold Spring Harbor came in third.
CSH wasn't the only school to host a charity event. Oceanside and three other schools wanted to participate in the meet but there wasn't enough space in the gym.
Instead they held their own meet at Oceanside where they raised $3100 for St. Jude's Pediatric Cancer.
"I've been coaching 35 years and it was probably the best day I ever spent watching a meet," Oceanside coach Andy Morris said. "There was no competitive attitude, kids were rooting for other teams. I'm really proud of our kids."
To cap off Cartwheels for a Cure, all the participants lined up on the mat and performed as many cartwheels as they could in two minutes with Matison and Charlotte right in the middle.
"The girls love coming here and cartwheeling," Kindelmann said. "It's great for them . . . the amount of people that come out, all of the support . . . it's great."

Teen hit by car, family meet 'angel' who helped save her life: Richard Lerner received the Nassau County Fire Commission's meritorious service award in West Hempstead for aiding Lara, 14

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Retired Oceanside firefighter Richard Lerner was driving to work one morning last September when he happened upon an accident: a 14-year-old girl was lying face down in the street after being hit by a car.
The girl, a freshman at Oceanside High School, was struck at 7:18 a.m. on Sept. 8 by a 1998 Lexus driven by a 63-year-old man at Foxhurst Road and Harvey Avenue, according to fire officials. The girl was unresponsive, wasn't breathing and Lerner couldn't find a pulse.
Still, with the help of others on the scene, Lerner performed CPR for four minutes - getting blood circulating through the teen's system and helping keep her alive in the crucial minutes before the ambulance arrived, said Michael Uttaro, an assistant fire chief marshal.
Now, four months later, Lara is talking and walking with the help of a walker, after her recent release from a rehabilitative hospital. On Sunday, Lara, her mother, stepfather and sister looked on as Lerner received the Nassau County Fire Commission's meritorious service award during a ceremony attended by County Executive Laura Curran at the West Hempstead Fire Department.
"She's a fighter," Lerner said of Lara on Sunday. "We do a lot of training. Seeing her now, it makes every single second worthwhile."
Lerner, a 30-year firefighting veteran and a Nassau fire marshal who has a son one year behind Lara in school, was emotional after the accident, but continued to work that day, Uttaro said. A police sergeant called him about a half-hour later to say that Lara had been revived at the hospital, was on a ventilator and going into emergency surgery. The driver stayed at the scene and was not charged, authorities said.
Lara, who had had multiple serious injuries, was initially taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, then transferred to Cohen Children's Medical Center in Queens, and then to a rehabilitative hospital in New Jersey, from which she was released Jan. 11, her family said.
"She had mortal injuries," Uttaro said. "She's one tough kid."
Curran said "Mr. Lerner's lifesaving actions were a result of experience and being well-trained. Events like this underscore the dedication of our first responders - especially our volunteers - who are dedicated to keeping us safe every day."
Lerner's emotions again were on display Sunday when Lara's mother, Marialaina, who asked that Newsday not use the family's last name, presented Lerner with a card, in thanks for what he did that September morning.
"He is a heroic angel, he truly is," Marialaina said. "We're family now."

Blind date becomes love at first sight and 60-year marriage

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Marilyn Moelis of Oceanside recalls the day she met future husband, Marvin.
On Jan. 3, 1953, I met Marvin on a blind date. His good friend had recently met my friend and they set up a double date with us.
We all went to see the film "Because of You," at the Brooklyn Paramount, and then headed to Junior's for ice cream and waffles. We were both 17. Marvin lived in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and I was from East New York, Brooklyn.
Although Marvin claimed it was love at first sight, he didn't call me until a month later. He was playing the French horn in his high school band and found the piece of paper with my phone number in his jacket pocket.
We started dating, and in June we both graduated from high school - I from Franklin K. Lane High School in Cypress Hills, and Marvin from Samuel J. Tilden High School in East Flatbush. In September, Marvin started classes at the University of Miami in Florida. We wrote to each other the entire year he was away, and I still have those letters.
We both knew right away that we were meant to be together. However, my future mother-in-law was totally convinced it wouldn't last, and at family functions made sure I was posed at the edge of any photos taken so she could cut me out after our inevitable breakup.
Marvin transferred to New York University in Manhattan the following year, and we started going steady. On his 18th birthday, I threw a surprise party for him. All our friends were there. I gave him an ID bracelet that he still treasures to this day. He wore it to his 80th birthday party last year.
Our parents realized we were in a serious relationship when it came to the Jewish New Year. We are not allowed to ride in a car or a bus on Holy Days, so Marvin walked the five miles from his house to mine to be with me.
We became engaged in May 1955, but waited to get married until he finished school and started his career as a stockbroker.
On Sept. 8, 1957, we were married at the Brooklyn Jewish Center. Our wedding was a beautiful affair, and we have many fond memories of that day. The ceremony was conducted by the world-renowned Cantor Louis "Leibele" Waldman. When Marvin broke the glass at the end of the ceremony, a tradition in the Jewish faith, he pounced on it to make sure it was broken. We took a three-week honeymoon to Nassau in the Bahamas and Florida.
In 1962, we moved to our home in Oceanside. Our two children have blessed us with four grandchildren, and we consider our grandson's wife our granddaughter.
Marvin joined Garden City-based Shearson Hamill & Co., now Morgan Stanley, in 1960 and still works for the firm. He enjoys playing the piano and says I am his best audience. He was active as a Little League coach and started the girls softball program in Oceanside. I enjoy crocheting and had my own business making yarmulkes for weddings and bar mitzvahs.
We celebrated our 60th anniversary recently with a family luncheon in Manhattan. Marvin and I also plan to take a cruise to Nassau in the Bahamas and Florida. We look forward to many more years together. The secret of our happy marriage is love, compromise, communication and being married to your best friend.

LI students go above and beyond to aid hurricane victims: Student raise funds for storm victims in Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida

Full text: Hurricane victims in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico are continuing to receive assistance from Long Island students.
Local schools have hosted dozens of fundraisers - ranging from collections of spare change to bracelet sales to school supply drives - to help provide relief to families affected by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
In Mineola, Chaminade High School raised $19,372 for Colegio San Jose, a Catholic school in Puerto Rico, through weeklong donations during homeroom classes. The idea was initiated by senior Thomas Daly, who wanted to donate extra money he had earned from landscaping.
"We may never meet the people we set out to help, but it doesn't matter," Daly said. "The family at Colegio San Jose is our family, too. It's important for us to take care of one another."
Fourth-graders at The Green Vale School in Old Brookville raised $1,150 from flower sales to benefit Puerto Rico through the Hispanic Federation's UNIDOS Disaster Relief & Recovery Program. The flowers - including dahlias, hydrangea and zinnias - were donated by Scarsella's Flowers in Laurel Hollow.
In Island Park, Lincoln Orens Middle School's Builders' Club and Student Council raised $1,130 by completing chores in exchange for donations to benefit Horace O'Bryant Middle School in Key West, Florida. Completed chores were displayed on paper hands displayed in a school hallway.
In Roosevelt, Centennial Avenue Elementary School collected 25 boxes of toiletries containing such items as toothpaste and diapers and took them to the Oceanside Fire Department, which organized a relief effort for Houston.
NEW HYDE PARK
School of the Year
New Hyde Park Memorial High School has been named 2017 Long Island School of the Year by Junior Achievement of New York, a local affiliate of Junior Achievement USA, which provides work readiness, entrepreneurship and financial literacy education.
New Hyde Park has worked with Junior Achievement over the past six years on its business education classes, Future Business Leaders of America Club and Academy of Finance. The school also has participated in Junior Achievement activities, including its High School Heroes program, Mobile Finance Park and Women's Leadership Conference.
OCEANSIDE
Caring Award
Oceanside High School senior Cory Nichols was one of five honorees nationwide for the 2017 Young Adult Caring Award from the nonprofit Caring Institute for "exemplifying selfless service to those in need," the organization said.
Nichols' efforts include founding the nonprofit, C the Difference: Cory Cares in 2012. Since then, he has raised more than $60,000 to help feed families and delivered tens of thousands of pounds of food to those in need.
Honorees were recognized last month at the institute's 2017 Caring Award Ceremony in California.
COUNTYWIDE
Red Ribbon Week
Thousands of Long Island students agreed to avoid drugs and alcohol last month during celebrations of Red Ribbon Week from Oct. 23 to 27.
In Oyster Bay, the high school's Students Against Destructive Decisions Club hosted a Grim Reaper Day in which a gong sounded every 32 minutes to symbolize the loss of a youngster to drugs or alcohol.
Students at Birch Lane Elementary School in Massapequa created posters using the theme "I will stay healthy by . . ." and displayed the finished illustrations throughout the school. Ideas ranged from exercising regularly to eating fruits and vegetables.
In Glen Head, North Shore Middle School's ninth-period classes silently walked out to the school's athletic fields to honor lives lost to drugs during a Walk Out on Drugs event.

Full text: The trophy meant so much to Jeremy Ruckert that, in the revelry after Lindenhurst's first Long Island championship last Sunday night, he wouldn't give it up. The Ohio State-bound wide receiver/linebacker/kicker - who displayed all of his skills in the title game - carried it high over his head with both hands as his teammates gathered in the end zone. Then he switched to a one-handed grip, held it aloft and waved as he raced across the turf at Stony Brook's LaValle Stadium to share the moment with friends, family and thousands of adoring Bulldogs fans.
"I'm not letting anyone else take this trophy. It's mine. I'm taking a lot of pictures," a beaming Ruckert said, presumably before giving others a chance to hold the hardware that was a long time coming and meant so much to a town that loves its football team.
"Without this town, I wouldn't be where I am today, going to Ohio State. I love this town," Ruckert said. "My dad grew up here; I grew up here. I bleed green and white."
All the blood, sweat and tears the Bulldogs put in since practice began in August paid off with a 40-23 victory over previously unbeaten Oceanside in the Long Island Class I championship game that concluded a 12-0 season. "You can't write a better story than this. I give it up for my teammates. We never quit. We have a bond you can't replace," Ruckert said. "I'll never forget this team. They're just amazing."
Amazing is how the Bulldogs played in 2017. Ruckert was part of an offense that averaged 38 points and a defense that surrendered eight points per game. "The great thing about this team is it was not just about Jeremy," coach Nick Lombardo said. "We had so many good players."
Ruckert, despite being double- and triple-teamed, caught 51 passes for 842 yards and 12 touchdowns. In the LIC, he caught five passes for 110 yards and a touchdown, including a spectacular one-handed catch that kept a drive alive after quarterback Nick Anzalone barely escaped a sack. Ruckert also contributed four extra points, two field goals and a blocked field goal that he returned 61 yards to set up Ricky Conway's TD run.
Anzalone was a model of accuracy and consistency all year. He completed 84.6 percent of his passes (165-for-195) for 2,074 yards and 24 touchdowns. In the LIC, he was 14-for-20 for 252 yards and three scores. Conway contributed 647 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns plus another 232 receiving yards and four TDs, including one against Oceanside. Justin Zotto had a TD reception and pick-6 in the LIC and caught 34 passes for 413 yards during the season.
Defensively, Zotto, Conway and Mitch St. Aubin (nine tackles in the LIC) formed a strong secondary and Malik Grant anchored the lines.
"It was a special team," Lombardo said.
One that earned a very special trophy.

Bethpage, Wantagh renew rivalry in Nassau Conference III

Author: Sarra, Gregg

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 Sep 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The football teams at Bethpage and Wantagh both have soaked in the rich tradition of winning. The teams have met 14 times since 2001, with each winning seven of those contests.
Bethpage travels to Wantagh for a pivotal Nassau Conference III game Friday at 2 p.m.
Wantagh, the defending Long Island Class III champion, cruised to a 42-7 win in its opener over Division. And Bethpage overcame five turnovers to gut out a 16-7 win over Lynbrook.
"These are neighboring communities that play for bragging rights and I love the rivalry thing," said Wantagh coach Keith Sachs. "Bethpage put us on the map in 1998 when we finally beat them. They were the standard. It gave our program instant credibility."
It is personal when it comes to Wantagh and Bethpage.
Now it's Wantagh that's set the new standard. The Warriors beat Bethpage, 21-7, last year.
"It was easily our toughest game," Sachs said. "They come to play."
Bethpage had a 48-game winning streak from 1993-1997 against Nassau opponents. The streak ended in a 7-6 overtime loss to Wantagh in the Nassau Conference III semifinal in 1998.
In 2004, Wantagh beat Bethpage on Homecoming Day, 28-0, the Golden Eagles' first home loss in 16 years - a span of 60 games.
There is an opportunity for Bethpage to gain some payback Friday. Wantagh and Garden City currently own Long Island's longest win streaks at 13 games.
Hempstead at Farmingdale, Friday, 6:30 p.m. Farmingdale (1-0) has been in the Nassau Conference I final in 13 of the last 18 years, winning eight titles. Dalers coach Buddy Krumenacker won his 250th game as a head coach last week. He is a former coach at Hempstead, where he garnered 77 of those wins. To beat Hempstead (1-0), the Dalers will have to stop star halfback Dashawn Meadors.
Floyd at Connetquot, Friday, 7 p.m. Floyd's defense is led by middle linebacker Danny Torres and he'll have to figure out a way to slow down Connetquot (2-0) and its strong-armed quarterback Dylan McDermott and the versatile George Wichelns. Floyd (1-0) relies on halfback Nick Silva, who runs with conviction behind a formidable offensive line.
Lawrence at Roosevelt, Saturday, 2 p.m. Lawrence (1-0) was 35-1 from 2012-2014 but has lost to Roosevelt (1-0) in the last four meetings. The Lawrence defense will have their hands full with junior halfback Kevon Hall, who rushed for 269 yards and four scores last week. Lawrence moved Christian Fredericks to quarterback this season to jumpstart the offense.
Westhampton at Half Hollow Hills West, Saturday, 1 p.m. This could be a wild offensive game. Both teams boast speedy playmakers. Westhampton's Dylan Laube ran for 262 yards and four scores in a 42-38 comeback win over Bellport to give coach Bill Parry the 100th win of his career. Top-seeded Hills West has halfback Deyvon Wright and quarterback Gerald Filardi looking for a breakout performance this week after getting past Comsewogue last week.

South Nassau Communities Hospital to open new cancer center

Author: Ricks, Delthia

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 Feb 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865728010?accountid=37869

Abstract: Because cancer treatment is a multidisciplinary enterprise, involving medical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists and nurses who jointly discuss a patient's case, having team members in one place is a major advantage, Datta said. "South Nassau is the Feil family's community hospital, and we remain committed to supporting its mission of providing quality health care services to the South Shore communities of Nassau County," said Jeffrey Feil, chief executive of the Feil Organization.

Full text: A new and expanded cancer center will be established on the main campus of South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside to consolidate the institution's treatment services, which currently are spread throughout multiple South Shore sites.
The hospital is the largest health care provider in its region of Long Island, but until now has not begun harnessing its cancer care under one roof. The hospital's Gertrude and Louis Feil Cancer Center is in Valley Stream, but other components of its cancer care are provided on the main campus as well as in Rockville Centre.
"We have all of the services that you would find in a comprehensive cancer center, but right now they are located in different places," said Richard J. Murphy, South Nassau's president and chief executive.
The project will involve remodeling an existing wing of the hospital to accommodate treatment services, including chemotherapy infusion.
"These are preliminary plans," said Joe Calderone, the hospital's senior vice president for corporate communications and development. "It's probably a timeline of about 36 months."
The $10 million project is bolstered by a $1 million gift from the Feil Charitable Lead Annuity, which in the past has given the hospital more than $5 million. In 2011, a $3 million donation supported expansion of South Nassau's Gertrude and Louis Feil Cancer Center in Valley Stream.
"It will be so much easier to be able to tell a patient that you can see the medical oncologist down the hall rather than three miles away in Rockville Centre," said Dr. Rajiv Datta, chairman of surgery and medical director of the Feil Cancer Center.
Because cancer treatment is a multidisciplinary enterprise, involving medical oncologists, surgeons, pathologists and nurses who jointly discuss a patient's case, having team members in one place is a major advantage, Datta said.
South Nassau's proposed consolidation arrives amid explosive growth in cancer services Islandwide.
Southside Hospital in Bay Shore opened its Imbert Cancer Center, a 46,000-square-foot facility, in October. Southside, a division of Northwell Health, transformed a former King Kullen supermarket at a cost of $46.5 million into the Imbert facility.
Starting in 2013, Northwell invested more than $175 million to expand cancer treatment services at its Cancer Institute, including an $84 million expansion in Lake Success.
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center will build a $140 million outpatient treatment and research facility at Mitchel Field as part of the Nassau Coliseum project. Memorial already operates three facilities on Long Island - in Rockville Centre, Hauppauge and the Commack center, which recently underwent a major expansion.
Between 2006 and 2016, St. Francis, The Heart Center, expanded substantially into cancer treatment, and remodeled the nearby former headquarters of the Pall Corp. on Northern Boulevard in Roslyn into a 189,000-square-foot cancer center.
South Nassau Communities Hospital, however, has a special place in the hearts of the Feil family, owners of a real estate investment, development and management company in Manhattan.
"South Nassau is the Feil family's community hospital, and we remain committed to supporting its mission of providing quality health care services to the South Shore communities of Nassau County," said Jeffrey Feil, chief executive of the Feil Organization.

CDC: Birth defects spike after Zika virus outbreak

Author: Ricks, Delthia

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]03 Mar 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873629765?accountid=37869

Abstract: Epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that nearly 60 in every 1,000 pregnancies involved a Zika-related abnormality. "All of these cases were travel-related, which means these women acquired the virus outside of this country," said Dr. Aaron Glatt, who chairs the Department of Medicine at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside. In reponse to the CDC's new research, the March of Dimes, headquartered in White Plains, announced Thursday that special...

Full text: Federal scientists have calculated a 20-fold increase in specific birth defects occurring nationwide since the abrupt emergence of the Zika virus - abnormalities that once were hardly known but now are capturing headlines.
Microcephaly - small head and brain size - as well as other brain malformations, eye defects, and central nervous system disturbances, were estimated to affect 3 of every 1,000 births in the pre-Zika era - 2013-2014 - in the United States.
But in 2016, women infected with the Zika virus gave birth to babies with pathogen-related abnormalities, leading to a noteworthy spike in the proportion of infants born with the same defects. Epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that nearly 60 in every 1,000 pregnancies involved a Zika-related abnormality.
Among those birth defects, microcephaly was diagnosed 33 percent more often in the United States since the virus was first detected here a year ago.
"All of these cases were travel-related, which means these women acquired the virus outside of this country," said Dr. Aaron Glatt, who chairs the Department of Medicine at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside. "We have been emphasizing that women who traveled to endemic areas to get tested."
The CDC is cautioning women not to travel to global regions where Zika infections are common.
At least six babies were known to have been born in New York Zika last year, according the state Deparment of Health.
CDC officials report on their website that 1,534 women in the continental United States were known to be infected with the virus while pregnant. These are women who had laboratory-confirmed infections in 2016 through Feb. 21 of this year. An additional 3,225 pregnant women during the same period in the U.S. territories also had laboratory confirmed infections.
Scientists are still studying why some infected women give birth to babies with devastating abnormalities and others do not. In January, researchers at Baylor University in Texas found that specific placental cells can harbor the virus, providing a conduit to the developing fetus.
In reponse to the CDC's new research, the March of Dimes, headquartered in White Plains, announced Thursday that special health care and social services are urgently needed for babies born with Zika-related abnormalities.
"This study makes clear the grave consequences of Zika infection for pregnant women and their babies," Dr. Paul Jarris, chief medical officer, said in a statement Thursday.
Glatt, meanwhile, a specialist in infectious diseases, said there are two answers to the threat posed by Zika and other mosquito-borne infections.
"I think the answer to all of these problems is mosquito control and a vaccine," said Glatt, a spokesman Infectious Diseases Society of America. "There is a tremendous amount of work underway on the vaccine."

Full text: State will lose money with open-road tolls
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo plans to eliminate toll gates on the 10 bridges and tunnels operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Most motorists will pay with E-ZPass via overhead sensors, but others will be photographed and a bill will be sent to their homes. Open-road tolling began with the Henry Hudson Bridge between the Bronx and Manhattan in 2012. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel joined the program in January.
I'm skeptical that it will be a financial success.
I made a Freedom of Information Law request in March 2015 to find out about unpaid tolls. After my repeated emails, my inquiry was answered in September 2015. I was told that from November 2012 through March 2015, the MTA billed $16.2 million for unpaid tolls on the Henry Hudson Bridge but collected just $11.1 million. That was $5 million in unpaid tolls.
I have relatives in Westchester County and use the Henry Hudson crossing from Manhattan. The traffic does move through quickly, but it's a small facility. When you consider the volume of trucks at the Whitestone and Throgs Neck bridges, I doubt their flow will improve very much.
Stephen Fleisher, Oceanside
It's a shame to not teach cursive writing
Imagine how upset I was when my 15-year-old grandson in Oregon asked his father whether I had written a letter to him in a foreign language.
That was when I found out that many schools in this country no longer teach cursive writing. Some of my grandchildren can read it (the oldest ones), and others cannot.
I am so disappointed that another wonderful cherished art has gone with the wind.
Please, educators and administrators, bring back this attractive writing method. I hate printing all my grandchildren's cards and letters so they can read them. What will be next?

Deer in Hauppauge pose a highway danger
I just glanced out my kitchen window and saw two deer foraging in the backyard.
This would be a bucolic scene - except that I live in Hauppauge, one mile north of Exit 56 on the Long Island Expressway. These deer just have to stroll down Simeon Woods Road and they're on the expressway, a potentially fatal accident waiting to happen.
Something has to be done to curb the deer population before someone gets hurt. And to the deer lovers, my neighborhood has been here since the 1950s, and the expressway has been here since the '60s. We aren't encroaching on the deer land, the deer are encroaching on us.

Mistrial for ex-NFLer's sonsin attempted-murder case
The attempted-murder trial of two sons of a former NFL player ended in a mistrial Thursday in Nassau County Court after the jury deadlocked, months after one of the brothers won an acquittal in a separate murder case.
Elliott Fortune, 20, and Jaiden Fortune, 18, remain in jail and have a court appearance scheduled for next week when a judge could set a new trial date.
A Nassau district attorney's office spokesman declined to comment yesterday on the mistrial.
A grand jury had indicted the brothers on charges that included attempted robbery, assault and weapon offenses in connection with a Roosevelt shooting that left a man with a gunshot wound to his face.
Authorities alleged that on April 20, 2015, the brothers tried to rob the victim of his backpack on Long Beach Avenue. The victim was identified in court as James Meeks, 31, an admitted marijuana dealer.
Elliott Fortune told his younger sibling "just shoot him," as the older brother and Meeks struggled over the backpack, according to authorities.
Jaiden Fortune then shot Meeks at close range, with a bullet exiting the man's jaw and grazing his left shoulder, authorities said.
They said Meeks survived after treatment in a hospital intensive-care unit, and he later made "positive photo array identifications" that led to the criminal charges.
Jurors began deliberating Monday, and acting State Supreme Court Justice Terence Murphy declared a mistrial Thursday after, Groder said, the panel had sent multiple notes indicating they couldn't reach a verdict.
The brothers' father, also named Elliott Fortune, played football at Roosevelt High School before going on to play professionally for the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens.

Attorney: Dog trainer charged with harassing man
An Oceanside dog trainer was charged yesterday with harassing a man who posted a video appearing to show the trainer poking caged dogs with a stick, attorneys said.
Brian DeMartino, 45, was arraigned on a misdemeanor harassment charge yesterday before Judge Scott Siller in First District Court in Hempstead, the Nassau County district attorney's office said.
He was released to probation and ordered to stay away from the other man, the prosecutor's office said.
The man, Thomas Marrone of Oceanside, was in court for the arraignment and said later that he was disappointed that DeMartino had not been charged with a more serious crime.
"I'm a bit disappointed," Marrone said. "I'm a witness in an investigation , and I was threatened.
"He just walked out of there , no bail," Marrone said. "He came and sat outside my house and took pictures."
The district attorney's office had no comment.
DeMartino's attorney, Adrian DiLuzio of Garden City, said his client and Marrone knew each other and "it's up to people to decide whether it's criminal.
"People do impetuous things," the lawyer said. "He wasn't nice there, no question about it, but that behavior has stopped."
The criminal complaint against DeMartino said he sent a text message to Marrone - whose name is blacked out in the complaint - and called him on the telephone.
"I will spend the rest of my life taking you down in ways that you could not imagine, watch your back you disgusting ," the complaint said, quoting the text message.
The video, posted on Facebook in December, shows a pit bull at NYDogWorks in Oceanside cowering and yelping, while appearing to be poked repeatedly by a man.
Gary Rogers of the Nassau County SPCA said yesterday that DeMartino owns the board-away dog training facility and that there is an investigation.

Merrick's Olivia Roberto a baseball star - and a Trailblazer: 13-year-old girl pitching and hitting well for boys middle school team Calhoun High coach hopes to eventually have her on varsity team

Author: Sarra, Gregg

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Olivia Roberto, a 13-year-old from Merrick, is trying to break the mold.
Olivia pitches and plays rightfield for the Merrick Avenue Middle School baseball team. A girl has never played high school varsity baseball on Long Island, according to Nassau and Suffolk County sports officials, but Olivia's next stop could be the varsity team at Calhoun High School.
There are no rules prohibiting a girl from playing baseball, but most girls choose to play softball, starting in Little League. Olivia said softball was never a consideration.
"I love baseball and I've been playing since I was 5 years old," said Olivia, an eighth-grader who said she caught the bug watching her older brother Peter play Little League. "As long as I feel comfortable that I can compete, I will continue to play baseball."
Calhoun's varsity baseball coach, Art Canestro, has seen Olivia play and is more than happy to give her a chance.
"I would love to have her," Canestro said. "She's instinctive and knows the game better than anyone on the middle school field. I hope she doesn't change her mind and play softball."
In the team's opening home game on May 2, Olivia, who pitches and bats lefthanded, struck out five batters in two innings. At the plate, she collected two hits, two runs and two stolen bases. Tuesday, she went 2-for-2 in the designated hitter role.
"Olivia is one of the best all-around players on our team this year," said Brian Resnick, the Merrick Avenue coach.
For the most part, teammates see her as just another player.
"I've been catching her for five years," said Tim Mack, "and she keeps getting better. . . . She's fun to be around and always positive."
This is Olivia's second season on the Merrick Avenue team. Resnick said she was welcomed by players and parents alike last year as a seventh-grader.
"It's my first opportunity to coach a female athlete in baseball and she's changed my opinion on girls in baseball," he said. "She's fundamentally sound. She's very coachable and she fits right in."
Olivia's ability caught the eye of Pat Shortt, a former major league scout who saw her play during a weeklong camp in Oceanside in February. Shortt of Hempstead recommended her for last month's Trailblazer Series, an elite all-girls program sponsored by Major League Baseball and USA Baseball in Los Angeles.
There, she picked up tips from Robin Wallace, who was the first woman to play college baseball after becoming the first to play high school baseball in Alabama.
"Olivia made the most outstanding catch in the entire tournament in centerfield and robbed our hitter of an extra-base hit," said Wallace, who played briefly at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, and has been with MLB's scouting bureau since 2012.
This summer, Olivia will play for the Oil City Bandits travel team out of Oceanside as she prepares to go out for Calhoun's junior varsity team - and beyond.
Olivia is sparked by a competitive drive that her mom, Dawn Roberto, said reaches all aspects of her life.
"It's who she is, part of her makeup," Dawn said. "Olivia has this aggressive drive and won't let anything stand in her way. She speaks her mind, never gives up and finds a way to be successful. If her brother came home with a high grade, she wanted a higher grade."
But at heart, Dawn said, Olivia is just a normal kid.
"She's a typical girl when she's with her girlfriends," Dawn said. "We had 20-something girls here the other night, all athletes, and they were all on their phones with chips and dips and music playing - you know, girl things."
Middle school baseball games have gone smoothly, but not every experience on Olivia's travel teams has been a home run, her father said.
"We've had a couple of instances where the opposing team tried to rattle her," Peter Roberto said. "The boys were saying, 'I like her, she's pretty, don't you think she's cute?' " Other hecklers have shouted "Go back to softball," according to her dad.
Olivia shrugs off the harsh words and tries to let her play do the talking. Olivia has showed she can handle the physical side of the game without backing down.
Last fall, Olivia was hit just above her right eye by a pitch that left her with a concussion, she said. "I had no time to duck," she said. "I came back but had to wear a mask."
She also barreled into the opposing catcher in a home plate collision.
"The catcher landed on me and cracked my helmet," she said. "But I was safe; I took him out."
It's that kind of toughness that could help Olivia realize her dream of playing varsity baseball.
"I will take her in a heartbeat," Canestro said.

Full text:   A man shown shoving a pole aggressively at a dog inside an animal crate in a widely viewed video shot at an Oceanside dog-training facility, is believed to be the business' owner, said Gary Rogers, the head of the Nassau County SPCA.
The video, which Rogers called "disturbing," was posted Friday night on Facebook. It shows a pit bull at NYDogWorks in Oceanside cowering and yelping, while appearing to be poked repeatedly by Brian DeMartino, 44, who owns the board-away dog training facility, Rogers said.
DeMartino could not be reached for comment after several attempts.
NYDogWorks says on its website that DeMartino owns and operates the facility. The website describes DeMartino as a master certified dog trainer and behavior specialist.
"He's Mastered the Art of teaching top knotch obedience and manners with outstanding results and has developed the most full proof and guaranteed system to fully housebreak any puppy or dog in the shortest amount of time," the website says.
Rogers said DeMartino operates the dog-training company out of his Luis Place home.
"From our knowledge, it appears to be the owner," Rogers said in an interview Sunday, adding that the SPCA is the investigating agency. By Sunday afternoon, the investigation was well underway, he said.
"We're still conducting interviews and trying to find out exactly what is going on to make a determination of what to do," he said. "We're moving very quickly."
Rogers said SPCA investigators enforce animal-cruelty laws.
"Like any other law enforcement agency, we will turn over to the proper authorities . The video is very disturbing."
The video surfaced through a private Facebook group, New Yorkers STOP Drugs & Crime, but group administrator Tommy Marrone later shared the clip on his own profile. It had more than 81,000 views as of Sunday afternoon and more than 3,840 shares. Marrone had previously boarded his German shepherd at the facility.
Marrone, 43, of Oceanside, said he and his wife sent their German shepherd Zeus to the facility in June for two weeks of training. He said he found the video of the pit bull disturbing.
"I was heartbroken for the dogs," he said. "But then I was just in shock. What happened to my dog while he was there?"
Rogers said that "in Nassau County, animal cruelty is taken very seriously and if it turns out to be animal cruelty we would file the charges."

Full text:   Nassau County legislators on Monday will hold a news conference in Oceanside to propose state legislation to create a license for dog obedience training.
The proposal comes after a video surfaced earlier this month that shows a pit bull in a crate cowering and yelping as he appears to be poked aggressively at a dog-training facility, officials said in a news release.
Speakers at the 11 a.m. event at 32 Murray Dr. include state Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach), Assemb.-elect Missy Miller (R-Atlantic Beach) and Gary Rogers, the head of the Nassau County SPCA, and Tommy Marrone, an Oceanside resident who on Dec. 9 posted the video on his Facebook page.
Rogers, who said the SPCA is investigating the incident in the video, said the dog was being poked by Brian DeMartino, 44, who owns NYDogWorks, a board-away dog training facility in Oceanside.
DeMartino did not return calls for comment.

Abstract: Oceanside (7-3-3) The Sailors missed out on the Nassau AA-II title after they lost to Farmingdale and Hicksville beat Port Washington.

Full text:   1. St. Anthony's (15-1-3)
The Friars followed their scoreless draw against Chaminade with eight straight wins, outscoring their opponents, 37-3. They defeated Massapequa, 2-1, on Dom D'Angelo's second-half header last week.
2. Chaminade (13-2-2)
Chaminade has won six straight since tying St. Anthony's on Sept. 27. The Flyers and Friars face off Thursday in a game that will likely decide the CHSAA title.
3. Half Hollow Hills East (11-1-2)
Hills East suffered its first loss to Whitman, which is finally healthy and looking like a county title threat, then responded with a 4-0 rout of Northport in its next game on Monday. That victory locked up the Suffolk II title.
4. Brentwood (11-2-2)
The Indians have gone 1-2-1 in their last four matches. Most recently, Brentwood lost to Sachem East, 1-0, in double overtime. It was a shocking result, considering Brentwood won the first meeting, 8-1, on Sept. 21.
5. Glen Cove (15-0-0)
The Big Red has played several close games this year but always seems to rise to the occasion for its best competition. Glen Cove has outscored the six opponents behind it in the Nassau A-II standings, 19-4.
6. Glenn (14-0-1)
After a surprising tie against East Hampton, Glenn beat second-place Southampton, 2-1, and then shut out four straight opponents, 22-0. Luke Karen (34) and Andrew Lule (29) rank second and third in the county in points.
7. Hauppauge (12-0-3)
The Eagles locked up the Suffolk IV title with last week's scoreless draw against East Islip. Hauppauge, which won its first nine games, has outscored opponents, 34-5, this year.
8. Jericho (11-1-3)
Despite getting shut out for the first time this year - 0-0 against MacArthur on Oct. 13 - the Jayhawks finished the regular season with 47 goals. Todd Perlman ranks third in Nassau with 15 goals, and Matteo Martino leads Nassau with 16 assists.
9. Massapequa (10-4-1)
The Chiefs have lost three straight, but two were to Chaminade and St. Anthony's. The third, a 3-1 setback against Uniondale, came in the season finale after Massapequa had locked up the Nassau AA-I title.
10. Oceanside (7-3-3)
The Sailors missed out on the Nassau AA-II title after they lost to Farmingdale and Hicksville beat Port Washington. But Oceanside took the season series from Hicksville, the conference champion, with a win and a draw. And Hicksville also lost to Farmingdale last week.

Arrest in store thefts
A Queens man pilfered more than $3,000 worth of merchandise from two Bath & Body Works stores over a monthlong span, Nassau County police said yesterday.
Rohan Esberry, 39, of Nashville Boulevard, Springfield Gardens, is charged with two counts of fourth-degree grand larceny and three counts of petty larceny, police said.
He was scheduled to be arraigned yesterday at First District Court in Hempstead. No details were available online.
Police said the thefts were between Sept. 26 and Wednesday, when he left the Oceanside store at 3559 Long Beach Rd. without paying for $126 worth of merchandise concealed in a bag.
Security officers stopped him outside the store and notified police, according to a news release.
An investigation revealed he also took items from the same Oceanside store on Sept. 26, last Friday and also on Tuesday, police said.
He also hit a Bath & Body Works in East Garden City on Sept. 26; overall, the stores had $3,175 in losses, police said.
Police are still looking for a woman who they say "acted in concert" with Esberry in one of the thefts.

Brooklyn bagel maker wins tax breaks to move to Nassau

Author: Ocasio, Victor

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]29 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1833219806?accountid=37869

Abstract: According to an independent economic analysis commissioned by the IDA, the bagel maker's move to Oceanside would have a total economic impact over 15 years of $274.2 million.

Full text:   The Nassau County Industrial Development Agency Friday approved tax benefits for a $2.6 million relocation and renovation project proposed by a Brooklyn bialy and bagel maker.
Canarsie-based Bagels by Bell, a third generation family-owned manufacturer, plans to renovate a 32,000-square-foot industrial site in Oceanside that has been vacant since it was damaged by superstorm Sandy in late 2012.
Owners of the company said they plan to make the move to Long Island and begin operations in January. About 40 employees will relocate, and the company has committed to hiring at least 10 workers each year for the first three years after the move.
IDA executive director Joseph J. Kearney said the project represented a "Sandy recovery" effort, and that the company is going to bring the empty industrial site "back to life."
Kearney called the combination of new jobs to be created and the company's buying of the property "a win-win" for Nassau County. "Working with our partners in the state and PSEG and National Grid, we were able to bring this company to Nassau County," he said.
The IDA approved Bagels by Bell for a sales tax exemption of up to $46,834 on the purchase of renovation materials and equipment for the facility, a mortgage recording tax exemption of up to $15,488, and a 15-year tax deal that freezes property taxes at their current rate - roughly $92,000 - for the first three years before increasing by 0.73 percent for the remaining years.
According to an independent economic analysis commissioned by the IDA, the bagel maker's move to Oceanside would have a total economic impact over 15 years of $274.2 million.
"We're excited and can't wait to start moving," said Jared Bell, 23, vice president of Bagels by Bell. "The Brooklyn boys are coming to Long Island."

State boys soccer preview: Calhoun, Amityville, Chaminade eye titles

Author: Kramer, Ari

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Nov 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837913175?accountid=37869

Abstract: The Colts had dropped their regular-season meetings with Hicksville and Oceanside by two goals apiece and had not beaten a team that would earn a seed better than No. 8 (Valley Stream Central) in the Nassau Class AA boys soccer playoffs.

Full text:   Three weeks ago, Calhoun's resume lacked a signature win.
The Colts had dropped their regular-season meetings with Hicksville and Oceanside by two goals apiece and had not beaten a team that would earn a seed better than No. 8 (Valley Stream Central) in the Nassau Class AA boys soccer playoffs.
Well, things certainly have changed.
The Colts are Long Island champions. They will face New Rochelle Saturday at 1:30 p.m. on Middletown High School's turf field for a spot in Sunday's state final.
Teams do not earn that opportunity without beating somebody, and, boy, did the Colts (13-2) beat somebody.
First, the third-seeded Colts knocked off No. 6 Oceanside in overtime in the quarterfinals. Then they upset 2015 county champion and second-seeded Hicksville in the semifinals and No. 1 Massapequa, which had won or shared nine county titles since Calhoun last won in 2001, to advance to the Long Island final.
In that game, Eric Stewart scored twice to defeat Brentwood, 3-2, in overtime. The Indians (16-3-2) have won seven Long Island titles, including six since 2005.
"It was an incredible run," said coach Jim Cantley, whose program has never won a state title. "Teams like Brentwood and Massapequa, they have a history of greatness, a mystique about them. So it can be intimidating, but our guys, especially the captains, they would speak up at practices and meetings and keep our confidence and belief in ourselves."
Those captains -- Stewart, Joe Thomann and Michael Harten -- have also played significant roles on the field. But the Colts have received notable contributions from several others, especially sophomores Alex Sipos (11 goals and five assists) and Ryan Hilke, who scored the overtime winners in playoff games against Oceanside and Massapequa.
Yes, the Colts not only have ousted several prestigious programs. They also have won three of their four playoff games in overtime, with a sophomore scoring the winning goal in two of them.
"Everyone feels great that we won," Harten said, "but I don't think it hit everyone that we won like this."
New Rochelle (10-4-4) has been on a special run of its own. The Huguenots from Westchester entered the Section I playoffs as the No. 8 seed and upset No. 1 Mamaroneck and No. 5 Scarsdale on penalty kicks before dominating No. 3 Arlington, 3-0, in the championship.
Cantley said his players reached out to friends from their club teams for information on New Rochelle while bussing home from the Long Island championship at Diamond in the Pines. Harten said they had little luck but did not care.
"You don't focus on what the other team is going to do," Harten said. "You just play your game and do what you can do."
Class A
For the second straight year, Amityville is headed upstate.
The Warriors, who defeated Glen Cove on penalty kicks in the Long Island championship, won the first state title in school history last year. They will face Somers (13-2-1) in a semifinal Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on Middletown High School's turf field.
"Hopefully we can bring the title back to Amityville, back to back," defender Carlos Ponce said. "We're going to go up there and give it our all."
The Warriors are 15-4-1 after losing four of their first six games. They have allowed one goal in their last 10 games.
CHSAA
Chaminade went five years between appearances in the state semifinals, but there was no layoff after its 2015 run to the championship. The Flyers, who defeated St. Anthony's in the NSCHSAA final, will return to St. John's Friday for a 6:15 p.m. semifinal date with Fordham Prep (19-0-0).
Chaminade (16-3-2) defeated Canisius, another semifinalist, in last year's state title match.

State audit finds fiscal issues in 2 Nassau school districts

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]21 Nov 2016.

Abstract: While bidding is not legally required, auditors found that Oceanside school district officials violated Board of Education policy when they did not always seek competitive prices for services.

Full text:   The state comptroller's office audited the Seaford and Oceanside school districts and released its reports earlier this month.
In Seaford, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's staff looked at the cash receipts of Seaford High School's "Renaissance Store," a student-run store from which the proceeds go to a school club.
Auditors reviewed the store's cash receipt process from July 1, 2014 to March 31, 2016, according to the comptroller's office. They found that school store deposits during the 2015-2016 school year were "not made in a timely manner," and the time from collection to deposit ranged from 15 to 91 days.
The store's receipts also were not documented in a profit and loss statement, the auditors found, or documented in enough detail.
Seaford Superintendent Brian L. Conboy said the district has already implemented the state's recommendations. He said no money was misplaced and the store's sales - mostly snacks to students - benefit the Renaissance Club, part of a national club that rewards good character.
" didn't focus on anything related to taxpayer money," Conboy said.
In Oceanside, the state audited the district's procurement procedures used to obtain professional services between July 1, 2014 and April 19 this year.
While bidding is not legally required, auditors found that Oceanside school district officials violated Board of Education policy when they did not always seek competitive prices for services.
The state looked at contracts with 15 vendors, which were paid about $1.3 million in total.
In seven of those contracts - worth $760,484 - district officials did not seek competitive prices, the comptroller's office said.
When such policies are not followed, "the Board does not have adequate assurance that services are procured in the most economical way and in the District's best interests," the state wrote in its audit.
Oceanside Superintendent Phyllis S. Harrington said the district was already changing its procedures before the audit began.
"We understand and agree with much of what the audit said," Harrington said.

Naples Street Food review: Great pizza, charming atmosphere in Franklin Square

Author: McCart, Melissa

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]01 Dec 2016.

Abstract: [...]to answer the mystery of how he ended up in Franklin Square. Besides the fact that it's not terribly expensive, it's near Oceanside, the hometown of Chiarolanza's wife and partner in the restaurant, Aurora Pagnozzi - whom he met when she summered in Avellino with her native-Italian parents.

Full text:   Naples Street Food
970 Hempstead Tpke., Franklin Square
516-673-4630
COST $-$$
AMBIENCE A modest storefront turning out great pizzas, warmed up by the pizza oven and Neapolitan hospitality.
ESSENTIALS Lunch 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday to Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 12:30 to 9:30 p.m. Sunday. Street parking, credit cards, takeout, wheelchair accessible.
Imagine walking up a cobblestone alley in Naples at dusk. Vespas signal with a beep before whizzing by. Streetlights on wires sag overhead. A yappy dog stands by its master on a balcony. Filled with oranges and in-season artichokes, a market display claims a corner, while the entrance to a bar stands across the way.
Join me now in Franklin Square, where the narrow Naples Street Food is decorated like such an alley - including a mural of one on the back wall. The lighting is similar, pendants in between clotheslines strung with a soccer jersey or two from owner Gianluca Chiarolanza's hometown of Avellino.
About an hour from Naples, Avellino is close enough for Chiarolanza to have grown up developing a passion for Neapolitan-style pizza.
Naples Street Food mostly serves takeout, but you should plan on eating here as often as time allows. The pizza is good to great, with more than 20 to choose from between red and white varieties. Although it is modest, the restaurant is warm and familial: Take note of the father and teenage daughter sharing a pizza at a table near the back or the gregarious man shouting at Chiarolanza in Italian, using half the hand gestures in "Speak Italian: The Fine Art of the Gesture."
Chiarolanza has been in the United States for about five years. Before he landed in Franklin Square, he worked at Sottocasa Pizzeria in Brooklyn, the shop from Luca Arrigoni, formerly at Keste in the West Village. From Arrigoni, he learned the art of transporting a giant pizza oven from Italy to his 12-seat restaurant on a main thoroughfare. But in Chiarolanza's case, it wasn't just any oven from Naples. It was his family's Acunto oven used in their pizzeria, now closed, that had been in storage at their home.
Now to answer the mystery of how he ended up in Franklin Square. Besides the fact that it's not terribly expensive, it's near Oceanside, the hometown of Chiarolanza's wife and partner in the restaurant, Aurora Pagnozzi - whom he met when she summered in Avellino with her native-Italian parents. "He's here to be with me," she said.
Pizzas take up most of the menu at Naples Street Food, like the marinara - one of my favorites - no cheese, with garlic, oregano and basil. Or the Napoli, with tomato, mozzarella and anchovies - not really a topping, more like a seasoning that gives a dish that non so che that makes a pizza more piquant. Among others, the Salerno displays sausage, salami and ham, while the porchetta pizza is a fight for dominance between smoked mozzarella, mozzarella and delicious roasted pork.
No matter the pizza, the dough is dappled, a sign of a cold fermentation, in this case an especially long one at 72 hours. The result is a light crust, in part because the pizzas are made with superfine "00" Caputo flour.
Don't skip the porchetta panozzi, a pork sandwich of the kind you'd find in Italian bakeries. It's served on pizza dough fashioned for a sandwich, so the bread is light and airy with a crisp exterior. Order it with broccoli rabe or roasted peppers, arugula or sauteed eggplant. Be sure to watch the graceful act as it's drizzled with oil before serving.
If cheese is your thing, there's the selection of calzones, like a football filled with mozzarella and ricotta, broccoli rabe and sausage served with sauce on the side. Wearing charred edges, it's a formidable dish.
If you must, there are salads. Go with the rucola for maximum greens, an arugula salad with cherry tomatoes, artichoke hearts, Parmesan and lemon vinaigrette. Though it's not from the in-season produce at that corner market in Naples, it's one of many fine dishes in the spirit of the place.
STAR RATING: 3

Keep dog from chewing sticks through positive rewards

Abstract: Betty Walsh, Oceanside A. I do not think that the crystals will do any good, but you can buy a concentrated grape extract from bird control companies that when sprayed regularly on a lawn will make the grass not taste good at all to the geese.

Full text:   Q. I have an 18-month-old pit bull mix that thinks he is a beaver as he actually eats sticks. He chews them up and swallows them along with grass, flowers and you name it. When I try to take them from him he just bolts and gulps them down along the way. My vet said that some dogs are just that way. Is there any way I can stop him before he gets sick or worse?
Fred Young, Uniondale
A. Your vet is correct in that some dogs are just that way. I had a dog once that would swallow rocks. If yours is chewing everything up before he swallows it, and your vet has examined the dog and finds nothing wrong, then most likely there is not an issue at this time. However, scolding or chasing him to get the things he is eating back from him is not a good idea.
Some dogs experience your concern and drama as attention, and just like some children, they would rather have negative attention than none at all. So if he does have a stick in his mouth and you think that he is going to start eating it, you would do better to show him a piece of cheese or some other treat and call him over for it, then trade him the cheese for the stick.
If he learns that every time he brings you a stick he gets a small piece of cheese, at least your yard will soon be clear of sticks and you will not have to worry about him eating them anymore. As time goes on you will find that you do not have to reward him with food for bringing you the sticks - he will just do it for the positive attention that you are giving him.
Q. My aunt just passed away and it seems that I was left her cockatiel that is supposed to be more than 20 years old. I put him in the same cage with my 4-year-old cockatiel and they get along just fine. My question is: How long do they live and how can I tell if the bird is really as old as my cousin says it is? Dogs get gray in the face when they get older, but this older bird looks just like my younger bird.
Gloria Douglas, Smithtown
A. The oldest living cockatiel on record was 32 years old, and I personally own several that are in their mid-20s. You are correct in the fact that there is no color change in the feathers of a senior bird that is kept in optimal conditions.
I am blessed with quite a few older birds of many different species that are my pets, and one thing that I have noticed about them is that their toes and legs seem to get very skinny as they get older, and they lose the ability to regrow feathers on the lower part of their legs. So, although I have never read about this in any scientific journal about geriatric birds, it is something that I have learned from my own experience in keeping many different birds. I suggest that you compare the legs of your two birds. If your late aunt's bird's legs look like the legs on my older birds, then most likely it is indeed as old as it is claimed to be.
Q. There is a narrow canal that runs behind my house, and we enjoy watching all the geese, ducks and swans that live there. However, the Canada geese have adopted our yard as a sanctuary, and I am sure that I do not need to tell you how much excrement these birds can produce and what a mess our yard is. They do not bother our neighbors as they have fences up where the bulkheads end. The obvious solution would be for us to put up a fence, as well, but quite frankly we like our unobstructed view. People have told us to sprinkle Kool-Aid grape crystals on the grass and that will keep the birds off. I wonder if this actually works as I do not want to encourage more insects or small animals by sprinkling this sweet product on our lawn.
Betty Walsh, Oceanside
A. I do not think that the crystals will do any good, but you can buy a concentrated grape extract from bird control companies that when sprayed regularly on a lawn will make the grass not taste good at all to the geese. The geese truly do not like to eat the sprayed grass and will learn not to feed on it when the product is used as the manufacturer states. However, even though the geese may not be feeding on your lawn anymore, they still may use it as spot to rest and relax out of the water, and there is nothing you can do to prevent them from doing this apart from putting up a fence or some other barrier such as a thick hedge of privet or rugosa roses.

Long Beach medical center plan supported by legislators

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]27 July 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1807000362?accountid=37869

Abstract: A group of residents with the Beach to Bay Civic Association has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Central Islip seeking to have $154 million in FEMA funding reallocated to stay in Long Beach.

Full text:   U.S. Rep. Kathleen Rice and Nassau County Legis. Denise Ford have backed a plan to spend about $130 million in federal disaster relief funds on hospital improvements in Oceanside and $40 million on a medical center with an emergency room in Long Beach.
The lesser amount of $170 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds will be used by South Nassau Communities Hospital to build a Medical Arts Pavilion and emergency room to replace the Long Beach Medical Center, which was extensively damaged by superstorm Sandy in 2012. Residents and community groups continue to push for all of the money to be spent in Long Beach.
Rice (D-Garden City) and Ford (R-Long Beach) co-signed a letter to FEMA this month supporting the funding plan by South Nassau.
"We write today in support of FEMA's environmental assessment of the proposal by the nonprofit South Nassau Communities Hospital to improve the health care facility in Long Beach and their hospital in Oceanside, which also serves Long Beach residents," Rice and Ford stated.
They noted that the old Long Beach Medical Center was struggling financially when it was flooded and damaged during Sandy.
The new Long Beach Medical Arts pavilion is to include a 9,500-square-foot emergency department, facilities for dialysis, lab work, X-rays and radiology, and a pharmacy.
"We agree with your finding that the entire community would benefit from the renovations and mitigation to both Long Beach and Oceanside sites with minor impact to either community," the letter stated. "And we believe the improvements proposed by South Nassau will ensure better access to care than was available to Long Beach residents before Sandy hit."
South Nassau purchased the 162-bed Long Beach hospital out of bankruptcy in 2014 and chief executive Richard Murphy said restoring the hospital was not financially viable. The hospital previously lost about $11 million per year. Murphy said the Long Beach Medical Center did not have the level of care, such as cardiac services, to meet the needs of the community.
"This will benefit the wider South Shore and enhance services not only in Long Beach but the entire community," Murphy said in an interview. "Had the storm not occurred, we might have had the same result and the hospital could not maintain itself over time. South Nassau has a responsibility to the community."
A group of residents with the Beach to Bay Civic Association has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Central Islip seeking to have $154 million in FEMA funding reallocated to stay in Long Beach.
The organization is seeking a small community hospital be built in Long Beach for local residents, including low-income families and the elderly, who are unable to travel to Oceanside, Beach to Bay president Barbara Dubow Bernardino said. The group has had several meetings with elected officials and the hospital, but were unable to reach an agreement.
"I guess they have an opportunity to stand with the community or a corporation," Dubow Bernardino said. "Everything clearly illustrates a small hospital is necessary on the barrier island."

Parental Guidance: Tips for managing kid's school bus stress

Full text:   Q: I have twin girls starting middle school. Our elementary school didn't provide transportation, so they will be taking a school bus for the first time and are nervous. They have asked me to drive them the first day. One of my daughters suffered from anxiety a few years ago, and I am fearful if she doesn't take the bus the first day, the next day will turn into an excuse and so on. But now a lot of their friends' parents have agreed to drive their kids the first day. Any advice?"
A: It's true that it's going to be hard to break the cycle once you begin it," agrees Laurie Zelinger, a psychologist in private practice in Cedarhurst, N.Y. specializing in children's and school issues and a former elementary school psychologist in the Oceanside district.
Zelinger suggested trying this:
-- Zero in on what they are nervous about. Is it that the bus might get them to school late? The driver might get lost? They'll have to sit alone?
-- Ask what they need to feel comfortable. If they have cellphones, you could stay on the phone with them the whole ride, even if it's just chatting about what you'll be having for dinner. If that's not allowed, suggest they listen to music or a relaxation tape using headphones. Or make a recording of yourself talking to them.
-- Consider driving to the school while they're on the bus and waiting there, so they know they'll see you when they get off.
-- "If only one child is especially anxious, I would see how her sister could help calm her down," Zelinger says.
-- Alternatively, ask one of their friends' parents who is driving the first day to take your daughters along. "They would still be with other children, and they wouldn't be dependent upon their mom," Zelinger says.

As storm exits, forecasters watching two potential systems; Nassau, Suffolk police report more than 350 accidents during storm PSEG: Service restored to more than 95% of those affected

Abstract: Note: Quotes: In what couldn't have been worse timing for morning commuters, a storm system with heavy, wet snow and gusty winds blew through Friday, slowing traffic, causing hundreds of car accidents and leading to school closures and power outages for thousands.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
In what couldn't have been worse timing for morning commuters, a storm system with heavy, wet snow and gusty winds blew through Friday, slowing traffic, causing hundreds of car accidents and leading to school closures and power outages for thousands.
That's as 9.8 inches of snow dropped on Long Island MacArthur Airport, with trained spotters reporting as much as 10.5 inches in Plainview and 11 inches in South Huntington.
And, even as that storm was exiting, forecasters had their eyes on two potential systems for early next week, though neither appeared to be "very imposing at this time," said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Bill Korbel.
As for Friday, Nassau and Suffolk county police responded to more than 350 weather-related motor vehicle accidents, with no indications of serious injuries, department spokesmen said.
Acting Smithtown Highway Superintendent Robert Murphy said downed trees complicated snow removal efforts in the Town of Smithtown.
"We've had dozens of calls on downed trees and limbs throughout the town," he said Friday afternoon, adding that it was particularly bad in Smithtown Pines. Town highway department workers are trying to remove snow, "but they had to remove the trees and the limbs to get to the snow."
Murphy said the town hired contractors to help cut down trees entangled in wires and remove them. "It's worse than the 26 inches of snow we had in the blizzard two weeks ago. The snow is heavier," he said. "The rains that we just had made the grounds loose. The trees are uprooting."
As of 9:30 p.m., PSEG Long Island said it had restored service to more than 95 percent of the roughly 43,500 customers affected by the storm. Crews expected to be working through the night to restore power to the remaining 1,700 customers without electricity.
Looking to next week, the National Weather Service pointed to two systems that could affect the area, one Sunday night into Monday and the other Monday night into Tuesday, each of which brings the potential to deliver more snow, along with minor tidal flooding as Monday is a new moon.
Korbel said late Friday afternoon that he and his team were "thinking storm number one goes out to sea," and were "leaning more toward some light snow Tuesday."

Seven Nassau County students were named best-in-category winners this month at the Long Island Psychology Fair.
More than 70 high schoolers submitted projects to the fair, a forum for student research since 2008. Those with the top 30 entries were invited to issue presentations in six psychology categories: biological, cognitive, developmental, health, interdisciplinary and social.
Winners were: Daniel Chai, Kamyar Ghiam and Anuj Gupta of Roslyn High School; Rachel Mashal of John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore; Jessica Huang of Jericho High School; and Michael Shen and Sunny Shi of Great Neck South High School.
"Their presentations were extremely impressive and were the result of hundreds of hours of research," said Barbi Frank, John F. Kennedy High School's advanced science research teacher.
Projects ran the gamut, from studying higher masculinity among female politicians to the effects of online popularity ratings. Chai investigated whether Asian-Americans are discriminated against in the college admissions process by submitting shortened applications that varied the student's race and type of activities, while Ghiam and Gupta studied how parental involvement is related to a student's academic performance.
In addition, Roslyn senior Nicholas Furci won the fair's first psychology bowl, which pitted participants against one another in a quiz-bowl setting.
FLORAL PARK
Knights Program
Floral Park Memorial High School has launched a Knights Program to help provide leadership skills to male minority students. The program includes "Power Mondays," in which students dress for success and monthly speakers are featured.
To help kick off the program, assistant principal John Kenny shared statistics that show obstacles often faced by male minority students, such as lower graduation rates and higher unemployment rates.
Jordan Dangerfield, an Elmont native who plays for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first monthly speaker. "Find something that you're good at and get great at it," he advised the students.
LONG BEACH
Chromebook initiative
The Long Beach school district has begun the initial phase of a Chromebook initiative, with the laptops issued to students in grades 7-12 for home and school use. In the first part of the effort, 139 devices were bought through a grant secured by Assemb. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach).
Long Beach staffers will have Chromebook training in the coming months through Stony Brook University. Distribution of the laptops will begin at the secondary level this spring, with implementation continuing into the 2016-17 school year.
"Students will collaborate with each other as well as their teachers, and will be able to create in a way that they've never created before," said Ken Graham, assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction.
COUNTYWIDE
Education Partners
Thirteen people will receive 2016 Education Partner Awards from Nassau BOCES for having a "profound effect on public education in Nassau County," the organization said.
Honorees are: Amanda Aronoff, a senior at John F. Kennedy High School, Bellmore; Deborah Coates, district clerk for Nassau BOCES; David Feller, superintendent of the North Merrick district; April Francis, lead social studies teacher at Lawrence Road Middle School, Hempstead; John Gangemi, founder of Nassau BOCES Educational Foundation; Kevin Harrington, president-producer at Plaza Theatrical Productions, Lynbrook; Phyllis Harrington, superintendent of the Oceanside district; Charles Osgood, host of "CBS Sunday Morning" and author of "The Osgood Files"; Catherine Pucciarelli, chairwoman of Nassau BOCES Educational Foundation; Donna Raphael, director of youth services and community relations for the Family and Children's Association; Casimir Rappa, a retired instructor for Nassau BOCES Adult Education; Eric Scott, groundskeeper of the Hewlett-Woodmere school district; and Steven Skrynecki, chief of department for the Nassau County Police Department.

SUSPECT'S PREVIOUS ARREST: PAPERS: ALLEGED STABBER HAD BEATEN ANOTHER TEEN IN APRIL

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Five months before Nassau prosecutors said Tyler Flach fatally stabbed a 16-year-old boy in Oceanside, the community college student and aspiring rapper allegedly beat up a 15-year-old in Island Park, leaving the victim with a black eye and cuts, according to court documents.
"Defendant Flach punched the victim multiple times with a closed fist and continued punching him as he fell to the ground," according to a criminal complaint filed in Nassau County First District Court in Hempstead. 
The victim, according to the complaint, suffered "substantial physical pain, a black left eye, swollen right side of the mouth with cuts on the right cheek, and cuts on the left and right knee."
Flach, 18, of Greenway Road in Lido Beach, is being held without bail at the Nassau County Jail on a second-degree murder charge in Monday's fatal stabbing of Khaseen Morris, a senior at Oceanside High School.
Prosecutors in May charged Flach with third-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child in the April 18 assault of the 15-year-old in Island Park, according to the complaint. The assault occurred at 8:15 p.m. on Kildaire Road, the document said.
The victim's parents could not be reached for comment.
Flach's attorney in the assault case, Steven Christiansen of Hempstead, did not respond to a message seeking comment Friday.
Following Flach's arrest on the murder charge, Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder detailed Flach's prior arrests, including the assault charge, which he said was part of an alleged road rage incident. Flach was arrested for the assault on May 23, according to police.
The complaint does not describe what preceded the alleged assault, other than saying that the victim told detectives that Flach approached him and spoke to him. Police would not comment Friday.
The assault case is pending, said Brendan Brosh, spokesman for Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas. He declined to comment further.
Flach was also arrested on Sept. 8 - just eight days before the Sept. 16 deadly stabbing - in Albany and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. Details of the allegations in that case were not immediately available. 
According to Nassau prosecutors, Flach plunged a knife into Morris' chest Monday afternoon during a fight over a girl in the parking lot of an Oceanside strip mall - a popular hang-out spot for students from the nearby high school.
Flach pleaded not guilty to the murder charge and was ordered held without bail at his arraignment Thursday.
His attorney in the murder case, Edward Sapone of Garden City, has said Flach "strongly maintains his innocence." 
Morris was a senior at Oceanside High School.
Flach, a 2018 graduate of Long Beach High School and a student at Nassau Community College, went looking for Morris with a group of about seven others on Monday afternoon, prosecutors have said.
Authorities have said Flach's friend - the ex-boyfriend of the girl - had sent threatening messages to Khaseen Morris, apparently under the impression that he was dating the girl. Morris' family said he walked the girl home from a party at her request and subsequently told the ex-boyfriend he wasn't dating her. Police said Morris and the girl were friends.
Also hurt in the attack was a 17-year-old - one of Morris' friends, who suffered a broken arm and swelling to the head. 
Police are still looking for the approximately seven others who they say were with Flach during the fight and stabbing. Police have said investigators have reviewed some video of the incident and talked to witnesses, but need more witnesses to come forward to provide statements and any video they may have. 
"We're also looking at the possibility of other subjects being charged," Ryder said during a Thursday news conference.
Long Beach Schools Superintendent Jennifer Gallagher in a letter to the school community Thursday acknowledged what she called "heartbreaking": that Morris "died as a result of a melee that involved teens from our Long Beach community."
Gallagher said Long Beach's homecoming events scheduled for this week were canceled in light of Morris' death.
"Holding a celebration this week seemed disrespectful," she wrote, adding: "I know our Long Beach community will continue to keep Khaseen and his family in our prayers in the days ahead. I am counting on the strength of this community to come together to help us heal the hurt, anger and sadness that caused Khaseen's death and that lingers still."
Keyanna Morris, the eldest sister of Khaseen Morris, said investigators told her that police know identities of the other alleged perpetrators and it's only a matter of time before they're arrested.
"They said they know the people," Morris said Friday. "Like they said at the press conference, they need to turn themselves in. So we're just wai

Amid the chaos, some did their best to help

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Khaseen Morris, all of 16 years old, was not alone as he lay mortally wounded on a sidewalk in an Oceanside strip mall two weeks ago.
"I saw young people with him," said Steven Ballin, who had pulled his car into the mall parking lot to find a number he needed to make a business telephone call.
Two, or maybe three, were kneeling beside Morris. "They were touching him, touching his face," Ballin, 71, said.
"I could hear them" Ballin said. "They were saying, 'Stay with us, stay with us.'"
Last Tuesday, Ballin was among those gathered in the Oceanside High School auditorium to hear Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder answer questions and clear up the rumors sprouting online. 
Ryder also was to address comments made by Nassau Police Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the department's chief of homicide, who, after the slaying, had said, "Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen. They'd rather video."
With Fitzpatrick's remarks, a narrative about a group of Long Island kids who'd rather shoot videos than offer help morphed into a national story - a wave of sensationalism that came uncomfortably close to obscuring what happened at that strip mall.
From the front of the high school auditorium last Tuesday, Ryder said he would share as much information as he could, without compromising the investigation.
Ryder said a group of young men had driven from Long Beach - some 17 or so minutes away -- "here, to the parking lot" in Oceanside.
Authorities got the first reports of a fight at a strip mall on Brower Avenue at 3:46 p.m. on Sept. 16, he said.
The reports weren't that a fight started or that one was ongoing, Ryder stressed, but that what had been a brief skirmish was breaking up.
The first police units arrived in 2 minutes, 29 seconds, and the first ambulances in 2 minutes, 41 seconds, he said.
Ryder said there were 20 people in the parking lot, adults and teenagers, as opposed to the initial police estimate of 50 to 70 young people.
"A lot of kids stayed," Ryder clarified.
"A lot of kids stopped," he said, "and helped us."
Police have several videos, Ryder said, and are "using them in this case."
Authorities believe there are more.
Fourteen calls, Ryder said, came in to the county's 911 center.
Seven of those were "instantly answered;" two of the next five callers "hung up," but authorities later called them back, Ryder said.
Some 911 callers went to a holding queue, Ryder acknowledged, "but we know the calls ... coming through are on the same issue."
For years, the Nassau Civil Service Employees Association has complained about staff cuts at the county's 911 call center. Earlier last Tuesday, the union's president, Jerry Laricchiuta, had brought the issue up before Nassau County lawmakers again.
During the question and answer period at the Oceanside High forum, a woman asked about online rumors of gang involvement - because some at the scene had attempted to hide their faces by tying purple-and-black bandanas below their eyes.
"There is not gang related," Ryder replied. "And you do not have a gang problem in Oceanside."
A few minutes and a few more queries later, Ryder called on a man seated toward the back of the auditorium, on the right side.
It was Ballin.
"I was there," he told Ryder.
"I can say that what he said is correct," he told the crowd.
" ... Whew," Ryder said, as the audience laughed.
In interviews last week, Ballin said he saw one group of young people in the parking lot heading toward a young man.
"I didn't know whether they were trying to sneak up on a friend, you know, the way kids do, or what," he said.
The next thing Ballin knew, fists were flying and one young man was being thrown to the ground.
Ballin, who had been on hold for his business call, immediately hung up to dial 911.
But he couldn't get through. Ballin didn't try again, he said, "because people around me were saying they got through."
By the time he got out of his car, Ballin said, the fight was over and the group he had seen in the parking lot was gone.
"It didn't seem like it at the time, but everything went so quick," he said.
Ballin said he walked over to check on one young man who was lying, hurt, in the parking lot.
"Someone had put a backpack under his head," Ballin said.
"I told him help was on the way and he nodded, but didn't talk," Ballin said. "He was in shock, I think, and in a lot of pain."
Ballin later walked the short distance over to the strip mall sidewalk, where Morris, he said, was falling in and out of consciousness.
Morris "was surrounded by two - maybe three? - young people," Ballin recalled.
"They were kneeling, they were trying to comfort him, they were slapping his face and trying to keep him awake," he said.
"Stay with me," Ballin said he heard individual teens calling out to Morris, over and over.
"Stay with me."
Someone had gone into a business, and returned to the sidewalk with napkins, which Ballin said he saw on Morris's chest.
At one point, a young man who had been leaning over Morris stood up, Ballin said.
"He had blood on his shirt," Ballin said.
By then police were beginning to arrive.
Ballin said he then circled back to the parking lot, to the other victim, who police later would say had a broken arm and swelling to his head.
As the first of several ambulances began to arrive, Ballin said, he told the young man that help was on the way.
"I told him, 'They are going to need to care for another student who was hurt really bad first,'" Ballin recalled.
"Don't worry," Ballin said

the BUZZ: Iger's 'Ride' began on LI

Author: Gay, Verne

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]13 Oct 2019: 2.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2304416655?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text:   Robert Iger, the world's most powerful media executive and among the most remunerated ($66 million in 2018), grew up in Oceanside and, as he makes clear in his new memoir ("The Ride of a Lifetime"), never entirely left Oceanside behind. 
The chief executive of Disney, now 68, writes in his book that his father Arthur, who died in 2010 at the age of 84, left a particularly indelible impression: "A brilliant and complicated man who shaped me more than anyone."
As Iger writes here,  his father was a Navy veteran (who served on a sub chaser during World War II), a jazz trumpeter, an expert on the Great American Songbook (about which he wrote two books), a professor at New York Institute of Technology and an advertising executive. A 2018 Vogue profile also said he "suffered from bipolar disorder, and his episodic rages made it impossible for him to sustain a consistent income. " 
 In his book, Iger concurs, saying that "by the time I was ten or eleven, he'd changed jobs so many times that I began to wonder why," and later learned he had undergone electroconvulsive therapy to treat manic depression. Iger recalled that he "never knew which Dad was coming home at night," and could tell by the way he opened and closed the front door, "and walked up the steps whether it was happy or sad Dad." 
Iger adds that he never wanted "to experience the same sense of failure he felt about himself."
"I started working in eighth grade" - he attended Fulton Avenue School No. 8 - "shoveling snow and babysitting and working as a stock boy in a hardware store" (although doesn't say which one.) 
At 15, he got a job as a summer janitor in the school district, and recalls "cleaning gum from the bottoms of a thousand desks can build character or at least tolerance for monotony, or something."
Meanwhile, here are a few other ties to Oceanside that Iger doesn't cover in the book:  
- Iger's dad, mom Miriam, and younger sister Carolyn lived at 102 Virginia Ave., a block or so from one of the main drags in town, Long Beach Road. His sister still lives in Port Jefferson. His mother (described by Iger as "warm, loving, a stay-at-home mom until I went to high school") later worked at Boardman Jr. High and died in 2013 at the age of 85. 
- Iger attended Oceanside High, where he graduated in 1969, and according to a 2005 Los Angeles Times profile, "played intramural softball, was on the Human Relations Club and was president of the Key Club, a sort of junior Kiwanis [and was] also sports editor of the school paper, worked as a varsity sports announcer and played Francis Nurse in 'The Crucible,' an Arthur Miller play. His senior year he was voted 'most enthusiastic,' ..." 
- Iger's parents wouldn't let Iger read comics as a kid, according the Vogue profile ("These were too frivolous.") Let that little irony sink in: The man runs the company that owns Marvel was not allowed to read comics. (Presumably he does now.) In his book, Iger offers a possible explanation: "My parents were wor

Brophy's time? Overtime

Full text: Sierra Brophy wasn't going to let this opportunity slip away.
The leading goal scorer in Nassau Conference AA-I girls soccer had chances throughout Monday's semifinal matchup, but she couldn't find the back of the net. In overtime, the Massapequa forward made sure that didn't happen again.
Brophy took a touch pass from Lia Howard, juked around the charging goalkeeper and scored from 15 yards out with 6:51 remaining in the first overtime period to break a tie at 4 for second-seeded Massapequa in its 5-4 victory over No. 7 Oceanside in a Nassau Class AA quarterfinal at Berner Middle School Monday evening.
"It was a relief," Brophy said. "I didn't want to let everyone down, which is what I felt like coming off during regulation," Brophy said. "But everyone inspired me to play harder."
Massapequa (13-2) advances to play No. 3 Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK in the semifinals Saturday at 7 p.m. at Cold Spring Harbor High School. Oceanside finishes at 12-1-1.
The Chiefs had to respond after a gut wrenching final 21 minutes of regulation. After Massapequa took a 4-1 lead off a goal from Jessica Lynskey with 26 minutes remaining in the second half, Ashley Ladner scored three goals in the final 21 minutes for Oceanside -- the first two coming on free kicks from 35 and 32 yards. Then, following a yellow card in the 18-yard box, Oceanside received a penalty kick with 4:56 remaining in the second half, which Ladner finished. But Massapequa responded.
"I think at this young age, it's shocking to their system to be up 4-1 with 20 minutes to go and then have three goals be scored against you on restarts and now all of a sudden you're tied 4-4," coach Bruce Stegner said. "It felt to them like they lost the game already, so I think it was incredibly tough for them and I'm proud of them"
Gianna Savella scored Massapequa's first goal, sending a through ball from Jackie Portogallo to the upper-left corner from 18 yards out to give Massapequa a 1-0 lead with 31:32 left in the opening half.
Exactly two minutes later, Massapequa created another goal with plenty of passing in the offensive end and Emma Cooney striking from 10 yards out to give the Chiefs a 2-0 advantage.
Julie Strianese scored for Oceanside with 20:45 remaining in the first half and Howard headed in a cross from Nicole Romeo with 4:20 remaining in the first half, as Massapequa took a 3-1 lead into halftime. Then the Sailors' resurgence started.
"Not going to lie, there was a lot going through our head," Cooney said. "Emotions were boiling, we were all on the fence about it but we had trust in each other and I knew we could do it. We've been in these situations before and I knew we were going to come out on top."

A craze for Cajun: Newest LI dining trend has roots in New Orleans, Vietnam and China

Full text: When Ben's Crab opened in Oceanside in 2017, it was the only restaurant on Long Island serving what it called "Louisiana Cajun Style Seafood." Now boiled feasts of spicy crawfish, crab legs, lobster tails and / or shrimp are popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. From Cajun Claws in Patchogue to Cajun Crab Shack in Floral Park, more than a dozen "Cajun seafood" eateries have opened in the last year or are planning to do so soon.
"The dining scene is changing," said Cecilia Burgos, a marketing executive at Hook & Reel, which operates one franchise in Hicksville and more than 15 nationwide. "This style of restaurant appeals to millennials, and also to Latino and African American diners." The chain has more than 50 new locations in the works, including in Valley Stream, Westbury and Bay Shore. Hook & Reel's corporate headquarters is in Flushing, Queens and, Burgos said, almost all of the franchises are Chinese-owned - as are most of the Cajun seafood restaurants in the Metropolitan area. (One notable exception: Ben's Crab, whose owner, Nico Salindho, immigrated from Indonesia.)
Menus vary, but the main event is a collection of crustaceans and mollusks, plus potatoes and corn on the cob, tossed in a huge, clear plastic bag with your choice of seasonings. The bag is tied up and boiled and then brought, steaming, to your table. Equipped with plastic gloves, lobster crackers and picks, you dig right into the open bag to manhandle your quarry.
FDCOV191205_video
Most restaurants offer a build-your-own bag option, with per-pound prices $13 to $19 for crawfish, shrimp, mussels and clams, around $25 for snow crab legs, $30 for lobster and topping out at around $40 for king crab legs. Or there may be set combos of two or more species. The sauce lineup usually includes garlic butter, Old Bay, lemon pepper and Cajun; the spice level is also up to the diner.
Salindho, who opened a second Ben's Crab in Uniondale in October, said that when his first restaurant opened, customers balked at the format. "'Why don't you peel the shrimp?'' they asked. 'Why are you making us do all the work?" But over the last two years, the complaints have abated. "Now that it's so popular, people have changed their minds."
 Cajun seafood restaurants tend to be good deals (you'd be hard-pressed to spend more than $40 a head), but in their desire to keep prices down, quality can fall short of the highest bar. Frozen shrimp, snow crab and king crab legs are a given (virtually all such seafood served in the U.S. is) but I ran into some frozen Dungeness crabs and, oddly for Long Island, even a few frozen clams. Crawfish and blue crab, seasonal items, also may not be freshly caught. 
Outside of the bag, other menu items may look toward Louisiana - grilled oysters at Voodoo Crab and Cajun Claws, po-boy sandwiches at Hook & Reel - or further afield to Maryland (crab cakes), New England (chowder, lobster rolls) and Japan (pork gyoza, edamame). Long Island seafood stalwarts fried calamari and coconut shrimp are almost always available. You might even run into a Kobe sliders (Cajun Claws), paella (Cajun Crab Shack) or a grilled tomahawk rib-eye (Voodoo Crab).
If you're thinking, "that actually doesn't seem very Cajun," you're right. The menus at these places are borne of an unlikely confluence of culinary styles.
The story starts in New Orleans, as you might expect, but the protagonists are Vietnamese. Louisiana was one of the locations where refugees settled after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and up through the 1980s. Joe Bui, who owns the Vietnamese restaurants Rolling Spring Roll in Farmingdale and Syosset, explained that "the Vietnamese experimented with the traditional Louisiana crawfish boil, adding their own flavors. I had a cousin who would boil crawfish with condensed orange juice and Vietnamese herbs."
The style spread to Houston, whose sizable Vietnamese population grew after Hurricane Katrina displaced (again) many the Vietnamese from New Orleans. By the early 2000s, Viet-Cajun seafood restaurants were "a thing" in Greater Houston, and also in California, which has the largest Vietnamese population in the country. Boiling Crab, a chain with 20 locations (most of them in California) debuted in Orange County in 2004.
The next chapter of our story begins in China, and requires rewinding to the 1980s. Crawfish had been introduced to China a few decades earlier, but now it really started to take off in restaurants. According to a 2018 article in the South China Morning Post, production tripled from 2007 to 2016, leaving the Chinese the consumers of more than 90% of the world's crawfish.
"Crawfish spread like wildfire in China," said Danny Wu, a Taiwanese-American who owns Thom Thom steak and sushi restaurant in Wantagh. "And, like other Chinese trends - like hot pot - crawfish spread to Flushing and, now, to Long Island."
As it happens, Chinese-American restaurateurs here were ready to take the ball and run with it. Tom Lau, who was a partner in the short-lived Cajun seafood restaurant Mighty Catch that opened and closed within a few months in Oceanside  (now the site of LI's second Cajun Bucket) noted that Cajun seafood was "the next big thing. First there was Chinese buffet," he said, "then a lot of people opened Japanese restaurants, then Asian fusion. Now it's Cajun seafood."

Shaver was the right choice

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The selection of Newsday's All-Long Island high school football coaches of the year is never an easy task. There always are more than a few coaches who deserve the honor.
Ultimately, we strive to make the best decision considering all the information available. We seek input from coaches, administrators and our staff. We report the score for every varsity football game on Long Island, be it with a reporter at the game or by speaking with coaches over the phone. We consider how coaches treat their players, officials and the opponents. To say the least, we do our homework.
And while the decision is always a tough one, this year was especially difficult. The winners of Newsday's football coach of the year honors are Lindenhurst's Nick Lombardo and Plainedge's Rob Shaver.
Lombardo led the Bulldogs to a 12-0 season, the Class II Long Island Championship and the Rutgers Trophy. Lindenhurst came back for a thrilling 14-13 win over Garden City after trailing 13-0 to win the Long Island crown. Not much of an argument there.
The selection of Shaver, though, may have raised a few eyebrows. After all, Shaver came under scrutiny this season when he became the first coach suspended under Nassau County's lopsided scores policy. It was a story that received national attention.
Let's start with Shaver's accomplishments. He did a remarkable job leading the Red Devils to a perfect 12-0 season, the best in school history, and claimed the school's first Long Island Class III championship. Behind the stellar play of Thorp Award finalist Dan Villari and a swarming defense, Plainedge did what it had never been able to do before.
Shaver received a lot of attention because of the suspension, but so did Nassau County's lopsided scores policy.
The rule was first introduced for the 2017 season after superintendents decided there were too many lopsided scores in Nassau football. The rule stated that games decided by more than 40 points would require the coach to explain why the score was so lopsided. That year, five games were decided by more than 40, but no coaches were suspended.
The next season the rule was changed to 42 to make it a multiple of seven. Since then, six games have been decided by more than 42 points, but Shaver was the only coach to receive a suspension after a six-person committee determined he left his starters in the game too long. Was that the right call?
Plainedge defeated division-rival and previously undefeated South Side, 61-13. Shaver's starters exited the game after Villari scored on the second play of the fourth quarter for a 54-13 lead, a 41-point difference. The ensuing extra-point kick made it a 42-point gap. Villari's touchdown run did not break the 42-point threshold rule and neither did the kick. An early fourth-quarter score by a second-teamer is when the Red Devils topped 42 points.
In light of what the Red Devils accomplished, should that cost Shaver coach of the year honors? We didn't think so, and we weren't alone.
We reached out to Shaver's peers and found his body of work through the first six games showed he was doing what he could to avoid running up the score.
"Rob should definitely be considered for coach of the year honors," said Oceanside coach Rob Blount. "To be fair, I would say there are a few guys in the discussion. But the suspension doesn't take anything away from what he accomplished."
Cellan threw his support behind Shaver.
"I'll be the first guy to say Rob Shaver should be the coach of the year," Cellan said. "He is an outstanding human being and an excellent coach. He's great with players and an educator in every regard. He had to deal with all that nonsense surrounding the suspension. He had to deal with his name being thrown around in a negative manner and the humiliation of being that first guy the committee dumped. It just wasn't right."
This decision was not easy, but we feel we made the right choice.

EX-SANITATION HEADS REPAY $300G PAYOUT

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]04 Apr 2019: 4.

Full text: Two former Oceanside sanitation commissioners paid back nearly $300,000 as part of a settlement with the sanitation district after the state comptroller said they received more than $800,000 in illegal payouts.
Michael and Charles Scarlata agreed to the settlement with Hempstead Sanitary District No. 7, a special tax district that provides trash pickup in Oceanside, after they received deferred retirement payments from 1984 to 2013.
State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli's office urged the district to recoup the $813,296 in retirement payouts in a 2014 audit, finding the payments were made illegally by the sanitation board. 
The comptroller's report said taxpayer dollars were misused because the board had no legal authority to issue payments, violating New York finance law.
Sanitation officials said following the audit that the district no longer issues post-employment payments.
The sanitation district sued the Scarlatas in 2017 seeking repayment. The board reached a $300,000 settlement with the Scarlatas in March, Oceanside Sanitation Commissioner Austin Graff said.
The Scarlatas, both of Oceanside, returned $200,000 to the district Monday and paid $85,000 last week. The pair received a reduction for paying in full within the first three years of the settlement, Graff said.
The sanitation district may use the money to reduce budget expenses next year or lower taxes, Graff said.
"It was a long time the district paid the money and we did the best deal we could to end the lawsuit and recover money for taxpayers," Graff said.  
An attorney for the Scarlatas could not be reached for comment.
Michael Scarlata signed an agreement with the board in 1988 to be paid an additional $20,000 annually for 15 years if he retired at any point after March 1, 1996. If he didn't retire, the deferred payments would be increased 10 percent each year after.
He retired in 1998 and collected retirement payments of $26,217 until 2012 when he received a final $51,122 payout, for a total of $391,000.
Michael Scarlata was hired as a consultant in 2013 to a five-year, $240,000 contract. He was fired by the board in 2015.    
His son, Charles, signed an agreement to be paid $25,000 annually over 15 years if he retired after March 1, 2008, with the same 10 percent increase of deferred payments if he stayed. The board paid a $421,353 lump sum Jan. 15, 2012, before he retired in October 2013.
"I believe it was part of political corruption in the Oceanside sanitation district and the current board is trying to wipe out corruption from the district,"

Full text: After regrouping from a tough loss, Farmingdale continued its charge into the postseason with a strong performance Saturday afternoon.
Anthony Matalone and Brian Hayden scored three goals apiece to lead visiting Farmingdale to a 16-5 win over Oceanside in a Conference A boys lacrosse game. Luke Woodland added two goals and two assists for the Dalers, who have responded well to a loss to powerhouse Massapequa on April 25.
"A couple of weeks ago, we took a tough loss to Massapequa, and we've played with a chip on our shoulder since," Matalone said of a 14-3 defeat. "Everything has gone up for us after that."
Farmingdale (5-2, 11-3 overall) has now rolled off three straight wins, including a victory over reigning Class D state champion Pleasantville in non-league and a 15-6 win over Plainview Old-Bethpage JFK.
"We're playing to get the No. 3 seed, so we knew today was a big game and we came out with a lot of energy," Matalone said. "From the first faceoff that Jake Oemcke won, we just clicked."
Oceanside (3-4, 8-6) opened the scoring with a goal from Joe Kiesche about five minutes into the game, but Farmingdale responded with goals from Matalone and Tom Decker in the first quarter.
Luke Hickam tied the score for Oceanside early in the second, before Farmingdale took over with a dominant run later in the period.
Matalone and Woodland both scored on long range shots to put the Dalers ahead 4-2. Hayden added to the tally with 2:15 left in the first half, before teeing up Woodland with a nice feed moments later.
"In the second quarter, we knew we had to keep shooting," Hayden said. "We moved the ball really well and found the open guys."
Hickam got his second goal to cut the hosts' halftime deficit to three, but John Pisciotta scored seven seconds into the third quarter to spark a 4-0 run for Farmingdale.
Liam Artus and Gunnar Johnson scored later in the period for Oceanside to bring the Sailors within five, but Hayden and Oemcke scored for Farmingdale in the final minute of the quarter to effectively seal the game.
Farmingdale finished well in front of the net and also had a massive advantage in terms of volume, thanks to Oemcke, who won 14 of 22 faceoffs.
"We had great help from the wings," Oemcke said. "Richard Hickis and Lorenzo Ramos were big, and then we had some great performances on offense and defense. We just need to keep it goi

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Nassau park may soon bear the name of Luis G. Alvarez, the Oceanside man whose sacrifice after one of the country's darkest days and dedication to fellow 9/11 first responders despite terminal cancer drew the admiration of the nation he served.
Nassau County Executive Laura Curran filed a resolution Tuesday to rename Terrell Avenue Park in Oceanside after one of the village's most revered residents, calling the retired New York Police Department bomb squad detective a "champion" for the men and women who responded to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.
The measure must be approved by the Nassau Legislature.
"Just weeks before his passing, Det. Alvarez, a loving husband and father of three sons and Oceanside resident, delivered a moving and crucial plea in Washington before a House Judiciary subcommittee to replenish the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund," Curran said in a statement. "This park will serve as a symbol and reminder of his sacrifice and unwavering fight for 9/11 first responders. We hope his family, friends and the community will enjoy this tranquil neighborhood space dedicated in his honor."
The park, about an acre in size and located at Terrell and Atlantic avenues, also has a line of benches overlooking a stream, according to county records.
In a statement, Alvarez's family said they were grateful for the gesture.
"The outpouring of love and respect for Lou continues to be overwhelming to us all," their statement said. "Lou was a very strong man and protector of family, friends and strangers. However, equally as important was the time he had to himself to quietly think and reflect. To have this beautiful meditation and reflection park in his hometown of Oceanside for adults and children to enjoy, is truly an honor to the legacy of Luis Alvarez as well as the entire Alvarez Family. ."
Alvarez, 53, died of colorectal cancer on June 29 after transfixing the nation on June 11 with his testimony alongside activist and comedian Jon Stewart, who also made an emotional plea to extend the funding, which was rapidly depleting.
Hundreds of police, local politicians and members of Congress attended his funeral at a packed Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church in Astoria, Queens.
In July, President Donald Trump - while flanked by dozens of first responders including several from Long Island - signed legislation to replenish the fund which provides financial support to people who were hurt or who developed diseases after responding to the disaster.
"We pledge to stand by the families of those affected today, and every day we will stand with you," Trump said of the bill which bears Alvarez's name.
The "Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act" provides funding through the year 2092. It also provides medical coverage for people who lived and worked in the area of Ground Zero since the attacks.

EARLY SCHEDULE BRINGS SOME POTENTIAL FINAL FOUR PAIRINGS WEEK 2 FOOTBALL PREVIEW

Full text: You can look no further than week two of the regular season schedule to catch a glimpse of potential final four playoff matchups in their respective classifications. It's early enough where a top team can suffer a loss and still make the postseason. Or, a team can make a very loud statement with a win and send the message that they're the team to beat.
"The tougher games earlier in the schedule don't catch most teams in rhythm or settled at some positions," Floyd coach Paul Longo said. "You want a good look at someone later because it gives you a better idea of who they are and what they do well."
Longo said, "Look at us, we're all banged up, we lost five guys for the entire season. We're looking for the right guys to fill those positions."
Floyd (1-0) travels to powerful Ward Melville (1-0) for a Suffolk Division I game on Friday in a 6:30 p.m. start.
Ward Melville has halfback Mike Fiore, who 148 rushing yards and scored four touchdowns last week behind a big offensive line. The Patriots have become a serious contender for the Suffolk title the last five years. Floyd has been the roadblock to the school's first LIC.
The Colonials beat Ward Melville, 28-21, in 2016 and 34-17 in 2018. Floyd has been to the S-I final 14 times since 2001, winning 11 titles.
In Nassau Conference I, Farmingdale plays at Oceanside on Friday at 4 p.m. Oceanside has a prolific passing offense with sophomore record breaker Charlie McKee, who threw for 170 yards and a score in last week's win. But the Sailors will need to run the ball effectively and find an offensive balance to beat Farmingdale. The Dalers have RB/LB Kevin Wilson on both sides of the ball and an excellent game manager in quarterback Nick Lundin, a dual threat.
"They spread it around well," Oceanside coach Rob Blount said. "Traditionally, they always play good defense and we have a younger team this year with eight starters either sophomores or freshman. Our O-Line is our strength so we'll want to establish a running game."
Suffolk Division II
Centereach at West Islip, Friday, 6 p.m.: They will rename the football field after legendary coach Wayne Shierant in a halftime ceremony. Lions kick returner Ryan Behrens started the season by taking the opening kickoff 95 yards for a score. They'll be on an emotional high after the Shierant tribute. But Centereach has become a divisional playoff contender and plays a very physical game behind Chris Crane and a defense that had six sacks in last week's win over Bellport.
Connetquot at Lindenhurst, Friday, 6 p.m.: The T-Birds dropped into D-II and meet an old foe for the second week in a row. They beat Northport last week in a hard-fought 13-7 win. This mountain will be a tougher climb as Lindy, the defending S-II champion, play a stifling defense and will put big-time pressure with Will Ruckert and Olasunkonmi Agunloye on QB Drew Guttieri all game.  
Suffolk Division III
Sayville at Westhampton, Friday, 6 p.m.: Top-seeded Westhampton hasn't lost a regular season game in two years. The Hurricanes are especially tough at home and Jaden AlfanoStJohn, who scored four times last week, is the next great halfback at the school. Sayville is loaded with offensive talent and junior QB Jack Cheshire threw for five scores in the opening day win.
Nassau Conference III
Bethpage at Plainedge, Saturday, 2 p.m.: Both teams have shown they can score points on defense and special teams in this backyard rivalry in Nassau Conference III. The Plainedge defense will need to shutdown halfback Matt Fantry, who scored three times last week.
Nassau Conference IV
Clarke at Seaford, Friday, 6:30 p.m.: Can Seaford's halfback Tom Viscio be stopped? He gained 242 yards last week and scored twice. Clarke is coming off an emotional opening day win over East Rockaway where they paid tribute to former coach John Boyle, with a new life-size statue of a Ram, the school mascot. Winning on the road for the Rams this week will be a difficult assignment?
Suffolk Division I
Patchogue-Medford at Commack, Saturday, 1:30 p.m.: Patchogue ended its 10-game losing streak last week over Sachem North and looks to build on that against Commack, which came back to beat Sachem East in overtime. Commack QB Aidan McCarty threw for 244 yards and two scores in the opener.
Suffolk Division II
Newfield at Bellport, Saturday, 2 p.m.: Newfield pulled out a double overtime comeback win over Smithtown East. But Bellport has hardly been hospitable to the Wolverines over the years. And the Clippers are coming off a loss to Centereach.
Suffolk Division III
Half Hollow Hills West at East Islip, Saturday, 1 p.m.: East Islip's defense, led by Tom Higgins and Dylan Rigo, will have to contain the explosive Hills West offense, which boasts two breakaway runners in Justin Brown and Dakim Griffin. Both teams enjoyed opening day victories.

SCAMMER BILKS SENIORS: AS MORE VICTIMSEMERGE, NASSAUDOUBLES REWARD

Author: Schneider, Craig

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 Dec 2018: 3.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The man who scammed $45,000 from an Oceanside woman - claiming her son had been arrested and needed money to get out of trouble - has stolen from several other Long Islanders, outraged police and officials said Friday in doubling the reward for his arrest.
Nassau County police said they have determined the unknown man, whose smiling image was clearly captured by the Oceanside woman's doorbell camera, has been involved in successful or attempted rip-offs of seniors on Long Island totaling more than $100,000. The reward has grown to $10,000 for information leading to the identity and arrest of the man.
"That piece of garbage - that's what he is," said Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder, his voice charged with urgency, during a news conference Friday. He added about such scam artists, "We need to take these guys out, and take them out of society and put them where they belong - in jail."
County Executive Laura Curran and Ryder both were so angry over the financial damage to the seniors that they publicly spoke harshly about the suspect during the news conference. Police suspect the man has ripped off more seniors than they know.
Curran called the scammer a "dirtbag" and urged victims to come forward.
"It's nothing to be embarrassed about," she said. "This guy, this dirtbag, came to the woman's door. We want to make sure that every senior knows how to protect themselves, so they don't become preyed upon."
Curran added, "If you live next to an elderly person, check on them, talk to them, make sure they're OK. If you see people coming up to their door who don't look very trustworthy, or who you've never seen before," check into it.
Ryder, who earlier this week reported the man's scam against an 81-year-old Oceanside woman, detailed the other scams that police believe the man has pulled off since early this year. He scammed a Roslyn senior out of $30,000, a Great Neck senior out of more than $5,900, another Oceanside senior out of $8,430 and tried but failed to take $18,000 from a Farmingdale resident, police said.
Ryder said police have matched the suspect to the other scams through other videos and pictures and victims' descriptions.
All of the suspect's victims have been above the age of 70, Ryder said. He typically calls them saying that a loved one has been arrested or injured, or both, and that they are desperate for money.
He is especially brazen in that he offers each time to pick up the cash at the person's home, Ryder added.
Ryder offered his personal assurances that the police would protect the victims.
"We will support the victims, we will stand by the victims, we will protect the identity of the victims," he said. "But they need to let us know because our investigation is starting to show there's probably more."
People should warn the seniors they know to be wary of anybody calling them or approaching them with a strange request for money, the officials said.
"We need to use the public's help to track him down," Ryder said. "We need to go viral, and we need to get him now so he can't get away with another one of these types of scams."
They offered to have police speak at senior centers. They urged people to install doorbells with cameras. They advised people to be careful what they post on social media, noting that identifying people in pictures with grandparents and family members can provide vital information for a scam artist.
Nassau police joined other authorities, including the state tax department, in issuing alerts on Tuesday warning residents to beware of telephone callers demanding cash for relatives or friends whom they claim have been arrested or kidnapped.
Anyone who receives such a telephone call should hang up at once and call 911, they said.
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District issued similar warnings against scammers who try to extort cash or gather personal information for identity theft.
The state tax department also warned it never collects tax payments in person and that "phishing" emails requesting personal information should be deleted without ever clicking any of their links.
In his biggest known scam - the Oceanside case caught on camera - the man phoned the woman and told her that her son had been arrested after a car accident and needed $7,500 to make bail.
Once he had that money, he came back to her with another ruse, telling her that a woman in the accident had been pregnant but lost the baby, so the bail was raised to $15,000. The woman provided him with another $7,500, police said.
He returned again saying that some $30,000 was needed in medical expenses because her son and the woman were injured in the crash.
"This is disgusting what this man has done," Ryder said.
Police showed the video of the suspect at the front door of the Oceanside woman's house. The man, stout of build with a ball cap and eyeglasses, approaches the door and looks from side to side. When the woman answers the door and hands him cash, he responds with a thumbs up and a big smile before walking away. He was driving a dark Ford Fusion with a license plate marked with TL & C, police said.
"Speak to your moms; speak to your grandparents," Ryder said. "Let them know that if they receive a call, the first thing you do is reach out to a family member to verify. And if you're not sure please, call 911. That's why we're there, to help you."
Anyone with information can call Nassau County Crime Stoppers at 800-244-TIPS. All callers will remain anonymous.

Arrest in scam on seniors

Full text: An arrest has been made in connection with a scam of elderly Long Island residents, including an 81-year-old Oceanside woman who was cheated out of $45,000, authorities said Wednesday.
Police declined to release the suspect's name. A news briefing regarding the arrest will be held Thursday.
Police had released the image of a man, captured by the Oceanside victim's doorbell video, earlier this month. Then during a Dec. 7 news conference, county leaders announced the reward in the case had doubled to $10,000.
At the time, authorities said the man ripped off or tried to steal about $100,000 this year from his victims - all above the age of 70 - by employing various lies, including telling them a loved one has been arrested, injured or both, and that they are desperate for money.
In his biggest known scam - the Oceanside case caught on camera - the perpetrator allegedly phoned the woman Dec. 3 and told her that her son had been arrested after a car accident and needed $7,500 to make bail, police had said.
Once he had that money, the perpetrator returned with another lie, telling her that a woman in the accident had been pregnant but lost the baby, so the bail was raised to $15,000, police said. He got another $7,500 from her, police said, but then came back for a third time, saying that some $30,000 was needed in medical expenses because her son and the woman were injured in the crash.
Video from the woman's front door showed a man with a stout build, and when the woman hands him cash, he responds with a thumbs up and a big smile before walking away. He was driving a dark Ford Fusion with a license plate marked with TL & C, police said.
He also scammed a Roslyn senior out of $30,000, a Great Neck senior out of more than $5,900, another Oceanside senior out of $8,430 and tried but failed to take $18,000 from a Farmingdale resident, police said.

Lawsuit to return $154M to replace Long Beach hospital dismissed: A group of city residents said FEMA disaster funds should have been used to make Long Beach Medical Center, which was closed after Sandy, a full-service hospital

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a group of Long Beach residents seeking a return of $154 million in disaster funds to replace the Long Beach Medical Center, which was closed after superstorm Sandy.
The Long Beach-based Beach to Bay Civic Association had sued the Federal Emergency Management Agency in 2016 after South Nassau Communities Hospital, which purchased the medical center, announced plans on how to spend $154 million in FEMA funds. South Nassau plans to spend $109 million at its hub in Oceanside and $45 million to build a stand-alone emergency room and medical arts pavilion in Long Beach.
South Nassau opened the 911-receiving emergency center in 2015, which is set to be expanded with rotating specialists while all surgical and inpatient care would be treated in Oceanside. The project is under an 18-month environmental review.
A group of residents, led by five Long Beach activists - Barbara Bernardino Dubow, Martin Gruber, Constance DiBenedetto, Mark Tannenbaum and Ed Glister - challenged the funding in a suit filed in U.S. Eastern District Court in Oceanside, claiming the entirety of $170 million, including $154 million in FEMA funds, should be used in Long Beach to return a full-service hospital to the barrier island.
The case was dismissed Thursday following nearly 18 months of motions and a request by FEMA to dismiss the case.
Judge Denis R. Hurley ruled that the civic association did not have standing to file suit against a federal agency and had no claim to how FEMA's money to South Nassau was spent. The court also found that "FEMA is certainly in no position to force New York to reopen the Long Beach Medical Center."
"It is apparent that the defendant has an element of choice in approving alternate use of project funds," Hurley wrote in his ruling to dismiss. "For example, nowhere does the policy state that if a proposed alternate project meets certain criteria that it will be guaranteed to receive the funding."
South Nassau officials have said replacing the Long Beach Medical Center was not financially viable, and the city did not have the demand to sustain a stand-alone hospital. Oceanside was selected to meet the needs of Long Beach residents and serve communities along Nassau's South Shore, officials said.
"We are pleased that the federal court has dismissed the Beach to Bay lawsuit on several grounds, including that they lacked standing to sue and that FEMA acted within its authority when it allocated disaster relief funds to South Nassau following Super Storm Sandy," South Nassau spokesman Joe Calderone said in a statement.
Francis McQuade, an attorney for the civic association, said the ruling could be seen as "prehistoric" as federal agencies are further deregulated. He said he would review the ruling for a possible appeal.

Longtime track coach Chernock, 90, dies

Author: Jordan

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Sep 2018: 47.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Track and field was an all-encompassing endeavor for Roy Chernock, and he loved every millisecond of it.
Chernock, a Hall of Fame track and field coach at Oceanside High School and C.W. Post, now called LIU Post, died at Trustbridge Hospice in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Sept. 4, his family said. He was 90.
"He was a leader and a winner," Chernock's son, Joe, 67, of Watchung, New Jersey, said.
Chernock was born in 1928 in Jamaica, Queens, went to Flushing High School, and graduated from New York University with a masters in physical education in 1950.  He was a Metropolitan and UAA champion in hurdles, long jump and relay events, according to NYU's website.
He was married to his wife, Ethel, for 63 years until her death in 2014. The couple lived in New Hyde Park from 1951 to 1965 and Oceanside from 1965 to 1973, and then moved back to New Hyde Park, where he lived until 1975, when he moved to New Jersey.  
"He was the best father a kid could have," Joe said. "He was always a high school coach and then he went on to college. He was around kids of a high school age long before I was of that age. Anything that I ever had to talk about, it was very easy to talk to him because he was always around kids that age."
Chernock coached at Oceanside High School and taught physical education there from 1958 to 1967. He  compiled a record of 105-3 and coached multiple state champions. He coached C.W. Post from 1967 to 1973 and his teams went 42-1, including its first undefeated season in 1968. "It was his life," Joe said of Chernock's passion for the sport.
While at Post, Chernock coached 39 NCAA All-Americans, five individual NCAA champions, won four men's cross country collegiate track conference championships, and two NCAA Regional Championships, the school's athletic website said.
Chernock moved on to coach at Baruch College in Manhattan in 1974-75, served as an assistant coach  at Princeton from 1975 to 1977, and spent a large part of his career at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where, from 1977 to 1990, he coached 13 All-Americans.
"Roy was one of the old-school-type coaches, where he could coach everything, " said Vin Lananna, who ran for Chernock at C.W. Post, was the USA men's track and field coach at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, and is the associate athletic director at Oregon University. "He himself was a good sprinter, hurdler, and could coach the distances. He did a great job during his time at C.W. Post developing athletes in just about every event. Today, coaches are more specialized, Roy was good at coaching every event."
Chernock turned C.W. Post into an outstanding Division II program, even competing against some local Division I powerhouses, Lananna said.
In recognition of his successes, Chernock was inducted into four athletic Hall of Fames - Oceanside High School, C.W. Post, William & Mary and NYU.
After retiring from William & Mary in 1990, Chernock coached at five Florida high schools, including John I. Leonard High School in Greenacres, where he coached current 49ers wide receiver Pierre Garcon.
Chernock didn't just coach the sport - he competed well into the final quarter of his life. In his late 60s, Chernock held national masters records for the 100 and 200 meters, and the 100 meter hurdles.  
In addition to track and field, Chernock loved to golf. When he was 73, he shot his age at Addison Reserve Country Club in Delray Beach, Florida. He also was an avid bowler who, at one point, averaged 190, Joe said.
Chernock is survived by his daughter Debi  of West Palm Beach; son Joe,and daughter-in-law Maria; grandson Brad and grandaughter-in-law Diana of Springfield, New Jersey; granddaughter Dana of Manhattan; and great-grandson, Michael.
A celebration of Chernock's life will take place in West Palm Beach at a later date.

New ER for Long Beach is canceled

Author: Asbury, John

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Beach won't get its planned new emergency room, South Nassau Communities Hospital officials announced, saying emergencies will continue to be treated at the existing facility.
Hospital officials said Friday they have altered building plans for the $40 million medical arts pavilion after costs soared from additional building code requirements.
"We think it's a better use of funds to leave the emergency department where it was," Joe Calderone, South Nassau's vice president of communications, said.
"It's not a retreat at all. There are more exam rooms and more procedure rooms and more specialists available," he said. "This is a substantial investment in Long Beach."
South Nassau opened the free-standing emergency room in August 2015, nearly three years after the Long Beach Medical Center was closed during superstorm Sandy.
City residents have demanded the return of a full-service hospital on the barrier island. A lawsuit by a group of residents arguing federal Sandy recovery money should remain in Long Beach was dismissed in January after a judge ruled residents had no claim to how the money awarded to South Nassau was spent.
The existing emergency room will continue to accept ambulances and receive 911 calls, but hospital officials said it will not be moved to the new adjacent medical pavilion that is to include radiology and offer treatment in primary care, pediatrics, OB-GYN, with rotating specialists for cardiology and urology. The new site will not treat dialysis patients, which officials had explored. 
Revised plans will add a total of 18 examination rooms to the new 15,000-square-foot pavilion and add two new procedure rooms. The site will also have an emergency staging area for a medevac helicopter. The existing emergency room will be equipped with a backup power supply.
Officials said the stand-alone emergency room has treated 31,000 patients since it opened, with 90 percent satisfaction rates and 87 percent of patients treated on site. South Nassau has already invested $38 million in Long Beach, Calderone said.
The hospital abandoned plans earlier this year to rebuild one of the two existing structures from the old Long Beach hospital into a two-floor, 25,000-square-foot medical arts pavilion built at about 23 feet above ground level.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency awarded South Nassau $154 million in disaster funds after the Long Beach Medical Center was flooded during Sandy. The hospital declared bankruptcy after the storm and South Nassau purchased it in 2014.
FEMA approved an alternative use plan for South Nassau to spend $40 million in Long Beach and divert the remaining $113 million to fortify its main hospital in Oceanside.
The federal funding for Oceanside will add a four-floor extension to the existing 450-bed hospital with nine new operation suites, a trauma center and 40 new critical-care beds. The new Oceanside emergency room expansion is expected to treat up to 65,000 patients. Plans also call for raising the main hospital's electrical grid above ground level and harden the site for storm protection of generators, heating and water.
"It's to everyone's advantage for Oceanside to be as strong as possible for future storms,"

Hospital partnership: South Nassau and Mount Sinai finalize joint plan

Author: Ricks, Delthia

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]04 Dec 2018: 13.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After more than a year of negotiations and regulatory hurdles, the partnership between South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside and Mount Sinai Health System in Manhattan has been finalized, executives for both health care institutions will announce Tuesday.
As part of the agreement, Mount Sinai will provide $120 million to aid expansion of South Nassau's campus and services. This includes plans for a new four-story addition in Oceanside with an expanded emergency department, new intensive care beds and surgical suites.
Executives on both sides said the partnership blends a major academic research center with South Nassau's community-based medicine on Long Island's South Shore. Together, the institutions can offer clinical trials and a range of medical services that patients previously had to travel elsewhere on the Island or into Manhattan to receive, they said.
"Mount Sinai is a world-class institution with a leading medical school, and this partnership will allow our patients to have access to some of the top physicians and most advanced treatments available," Richard J. Murphy, South Nassau's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "It also will help South Nassau reach the next level in our role as a growing regional medical center."
South Nassau is a 455-bed institution that has served Long Island's South Shore since 1928. The cash from Mount Sinai will help lay the foundation for the hospital's five-year master facility plan, which calls for greater expansion and increasing its footprint in the region.
Affiliation talks were first announced in May 2017, when executives on both sides of the partnership said they intended to explore a formal agreement that would align medical services, management and governance of the institutions.
South Nassau Communities Hospital officially became the Long Island flagship health care institution in the Mount Sinai system after a unanimous vote by the Oceanside hospital's board of trustees in January.
"All of the regulatory approvals have been completed," said Dr. Arthur Klein, president of the Mount Sinai Health Network.
Approvals of the new partnership have been made by the New York State Department of Health, the New York State Attorney General and the New York State Department of Education.
What has yet to be decided, Klein said in an interview, is how the name of both institutions will be reflected in a renaming of South Nassau. New naming ultimately will reflect South Nassau's status as the Long Island flagship of Mount Sinai, executives said.
"We are working cooperately with South Nassau and a consulting firm [on renaming] that reflects the legacy of South Nassau as well as the alignment with Mount Sinai," Klein said. "We are doing this in a way that is collaborative."
In a similar affiliation between NYU and the former Winthrop-University Hospital, a formalized agreement resulted in the Mineola institution being renamed NYU Winthrop Hospital.
During the past 10 months, administrators at both institutions have been collaborating on aligning Mount Sinai's academic, clinical and research expertise with South Nassau's community-based system of care, Klein added.
Mount Sinai specialists already have begun collaborating with physicians at South Nassau to provide more specialized, advanced care, Klein said.
Approval has been granted by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education for a new internal medicine residency program on the South Nassau campus, which will train doctors in that key area of primary care, Klein said.

Advocates, Hempstead spar over feral cat colony at landfill

Author: Schapitl, Lexie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Protesters on Saturday again demanded proper care for a feral cat colony in an Oceanside landfill, while Town of Hempstead officials insisted the cats were being fed and sheltered.
Stanley Lombardo, a retired Town of Hempstead employee and East Rockaway resident, said he had cared for about 40 cats in the Oceanside Transfer Station for about 10 years until four weeks ago, when he said he was not allowed into town's waste facility. Now, Lombardo and other animal welfare activists are concerned about the colony's welfare.
The Town of Hempstead issued a statement Thursday saying town personnel are "feeding, providing shelter and changing litter for the feline population at the site."
The statement added that the public is not allowed onto the site because of safety risks and liability issues posed by payloaders, large trucks and tractors.
Some of about 50 protesters said Saturday they're not convinced, and want independent verification that the cats are OK.
"They want us to simply take their word for it," said Stuart Kroll, 59, of Port Washington.
Lombardo said residents have watched the gate to the waste facility in shifts and not seen town personnel enter or exit to feed the cats.
A detective with the Nassau County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals visited the site unannounced on June 23, the day before animal welfare activists held their first protest on the issue, said Gary Rogers, head of the county SPCA. The detective saw food, water, litter and blankets left out for the cats, and the SPCA is satisfied that the cats are being cared for, Rogers said.
"If we thought the cats weren't being fed, under law we have the absolute right to stop an act of cruelty," he said. "We would go in there and feed them ourselves."
While Lombardo would like to be allowed back onto the facility, he said the group would be satisfied with installing cameras to monitor the area, trapping and removing the cats from the site or having another outsider care for them. Protesters are willing to sign a waiver releasing the town from liability, he said.
The group will continue to protest "every week for as long as it takes," Lombardo said.
"I'm not your typical cat guy, but if you're an animal lover, animals begin to grow on you," he said.

Former Hempstead Town worker sues town over landfill cats

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]24 Aug 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A retired Hempstead Town employee who fed a feral cat population at the town's Oceanside landfill has filed a federal lawsuit against the town, a sanitation superintendent and Supervisor Anthony Santino, alleging he was denied access to care for the animals in retribution for his "lack of loyalty" to the supervisor.
Stanley Lombardo, 63, of East Rockaway, held a news conference on Wednesday afternoon announcing the suit outside the Oceanside Transfer Facility with his lawyer, Jonathan Tand of Garden City.
Lombardo, a former East Rockaway village trustee who retired from the town in November as an assistant superintendent of sanitation after 27 years there, said he has taken care of about 40 cats at the landfill for a decade. In his suit, filed in Eastern District Court in Central Islip on Monday, he is seeking unspecified damages and a judgment that will allow him to continue caring for the animals.
Lombardo has been banned from feeding the cats as a "political retribution" because he "would not fall in line with Mr. Santino's directions," Tand said.
The lawsuit, which also names sanitation superintendent Thomas Metzger, further alleges that Santino and Metzger have harassed Lombardo and his family members who work for the town.
"While the town will not comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, it is our position that it is frivolous and without merit," town spokesman Mike Deery said.
Lombardo and other animal advocates held protests beginning in June, demanding that they be allowed to care for the cat colony.
"I couldn't see them go hungry," Lombardo said at the news conference. "I know most of these cats by name."
The Town of Hempstead issued a statement in June, saying town personnel are "feeding, providing shelter and changing litter for the feline population at the site." Deery said on Wednesday that the town continues to care for the cats.
The landfill, located off Long Beach Road, is not open to the public because of safety risks and liability issues posed by payloaders, large trucks and tractors, the town has said.

'Trunk or Treat' events on Long Island

Author: Whitehouse, Beth

Full text: This Halloween, Vanessa Espinal of Brentwood won't just be providing costumes for her family members - she'll also be dressing up the trunk of her car.
Espinal plans to participate in Brentwood's second annual Trunk-or-Treat event scheduled for Sunday, when community members and organizations decorate cars, park them all close together, and let kids "trick or treat" for candy and trinkets from trunk to trunk rather than door to door.
Last year, Espinal, her husband and their two daughters - plus their dog - dressed in Ghostbusters costumes and decorated the trunk of their Honda Pilot as the Ghostbusters' Ectomobile. This year, she says she thinks the family will do a "breakfast" theme. "My husband is going to dress up as the egg," she says of hubby, William. Espinal plans to be a slice of toast, and the girls, Angelina, 13, and Bianca, 8, are currently sparring over who will be the bacon and who will be the pancake, Espinal says. They plan to decorate the trunk as a griddle. Oh, and their Shih Tzu, Sassy, will be hash browns.
The free Brentwood event is sponsored by Suffolk County Legis. Monica R. Martinez, and will take place from 1 to 4 p.m. in the parking lot of her office at 55 Second Ave. in Brentwood. "This year we'll have about 24 cars," Martinez says.
Oceanside event
Other communities on Long Island are celebrating with free "Trunk or Treat" meetups as well. Oceanside has its Trunk or Treat on the weekend after Halloween, Nov. 4, from 9 to 11 a.m. in the parking lot of Tower Funeral Home, 2681 Long Beach Rd.
This is the sixth annual Trunk or Treat for Oceanside - that community's event started when superstorm Sandy canceled Halloween in 2012, says John Madden of Oceanside. He says he helped launch the event after his daughter, who was 3 at the time, didn't understand why she couldn't dress up as Izzy from "Jake and the Neverland Pirates" as planned.
"She didn't understand that the town was wiped out by a hurricane," Madden says. "I had heard of these Trunk-or-Treat events in other places. It stuck ever since then on the weekend after Halloween. We look at it as a chance to wear the costumes one more time."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Change is good and in this case it's exciting. There is a buzz in Oceanside, Westhampton and Miller Place as those football programs will make their first appearance in the Long Island Championships.
"It's all about the LIC," said Oceanside coach Rob Blount, whose team will compete for the LI Class I title. "It's the pinnacle of high school football on Long Island. Our schools don't participate in the state championship tournament, so this is our Super Bowl."
The Long Island Championships started in 1992 and 56 schools have made at least one appearance with 43 different teams claiming at least one title. Suffolk teams hold a 56-44 edge in the all-time Nassau-Suffolk series, the brainchild of then football chairmen Bill Piner of Section VIII and Nick Schroeder of Section XI.
"We have an outstanding student section and community base of fans, whether it's home or away, they come to support us," Blount said. "We'll have a great turnout."
Undefeated Oceanside will have five spectator buses ready to roll on Sunday for its Class I title game against Lindenhurst at 4:30 p.m. at Stony Brook University.
They're equally excited in Miller Place where the Panthers will play Seaford in hopes of winning their first LI Class IV crown Friday at noon at Hofstra University.
"We're still practicing this week, including Thanksgiving morning, so that in itself is a big deal," said Miller Place coach Greg Murphy. "Our football program has always been on the cusp of something big. But winning the Suffolk title and getting the opportunity to play in the LIC is incredible for our program and community and the excitement and awareness is at another level."
Miller Place vs. Seaford, Class IV, Friday, noon, Hofstra University
Seaford (9-2) makes its eighth trip to the Class IV final. The Vikings are on a five-game win streak and avenged both losses this season with playoff victories over Locust Valley and previously undefeated Cold Spring Harbor. Their last title came in 2009 with a 34-20 win over Amityville. The Vikings run behind backs Joe Angelastro, Tyler Volpi and Nick Calandra. Miller Place (10-1) is on a seven-game win streak and knocked off three-time defending Class IV champ Babylon with a 28-0 semifinal win. Quarterback Anthony Seymour has thrown for 1,503 yards and 21 touchdowns and only two interceptions. His favorite target is Suffolk's leading receiver Tom Nealis with 836 yards and 12 touchdowns.
North Babylon vs. Garden City, Class II, Friday, 4:30 p.m., Hofstra University
Garden City (11-0) is on Long Island's longest current win streak at 23 games. The Trojans are also the defending Class II champions. They win with defense led by Andrew DeSantis on a unit that has allowed only six points per game. The offense rolls with halfback Trevor Yeboah-Kodie who has 1,167 yards rushing and 26 touchdowns. North Babylon (10-1) runs and runs behind halfback David Estrella, who has 1,938 yards and 26 touchdowns. The Bulldogs and Trojans are familiar foes. They've each won six LIC titles and split the four times they've met.
Lawrence vs. Westhampton, Class III, Sunday, noon, Stony Brook University
Two high-octane offenses square off for the Class III title. Westhampton (11-0) averages 41 points per game and has Dylan Laube, Long Island's leading rusher, who has 2,453 yards rushing and 41 total touchdowns. The Hurricanes are making their first appearance against a Lawrence program and heads to the LIC for the 10th time. The Golden Tornadoes have a dual threat in Chris Collier, who has 1,513 yards and 21 touchdowns and Christian Fredericks, who has over 1,300 all-purpose yards.
Oceanside vs. Lindenhurst, Class I, Sunday, 4:30 p.m., Stony Brook University
Two undefeated teams collide for the Class I crown. Oceanside quarterback Tom Heuer has had an incredible season with 2,661 yards passing, 36 touchdowns and two interceptions on the way to an 11-0 season. The Sailors have a quality receiving corps in Jake Lazzaro, Derek Cruz, Dylan Judd and Bernie Diaz. Lindenhurst (11-0) counters with quarterback Nick Anzalone, who has thrown for 1,822 yards, 21 touchdowns and five interceptions. Bulldogs receiver Jeremy Ruckert has 732 yards receiving and 11 touchdowns and halfback Ricky Conway has 802 yards rushing and 17 scores.

LIRR: More glitches delay trains Monday night

Author: Dowdy, Zachary R; Castillo, Alfonso A

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]24 Jan 2017.

Abstract: LIRR storm prep measures typically include having additional personnel available to respond to fallen tree limbs and utility poles, to address power issues and repair broken crossing gates, and to check and clear drains.

Full text:   Scattered glitches resurfaced along the LIRR on Monday night, making for uneven service as some lines saw delays blamed on various snags - equipment trouble, a fallen utility pole and residual delays, officials said.
By 11 p.m. Monday, a train from Penn Station that had been expected in Huntington at 10:49 p.m. was running 13 minutes late due to equipment trouble, Long Island Rail Road officials said.
A utility pole that fell in the morning in Oceanside was still causing delays well past afternoon rush hour, making a westbound train from Long Beach that was due in Manhattan at 10:44 p.m. some 16 minutes late.
And a train due in Oyster Bay at 11:04 p.m. was operating 16 minutes late because another late train was in front of it, officials said.
A spokeswoman said that almost all of the lines had been operating with minimal problems around 5 p.m. as the region braced for the arrival of a fierce nor'easter that threatened to throw a wrench into the LIRR system.
Nancy Gamerman, the spokeswoman, said some of the problems that beset the railroad throughout the day had been solved as they cropped up - though some, like the downed pole in Oceanside, lasted all day.
At around 5 p.m., the West Hempstead and Long Beach lines were running up to 11 minutes behind schedule due to equipment failure and the downed utility pole in Oceanside, respectively.
Downed poles caused delays on the Port Washington branch, where service was suspended in both directions about 9 a.m. between Port Washington and Great Neck, and on the Long Beach branch, where the pole fell in Oceanside.
Westbound traffic was also affected by signal problems east of Mineola, officials said in a tweet that reported delays of up to 18 minutes on Penn Station-bound trains.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office said the LIRR "is deploying extra staff to deal with any potential track and power issues."
LIRR storm prep measures typically include having additional personnel available to respond to fallen tree limbs and utility poles, to address power issues and repair broken crossing gates, and to check and clear drains.
The MTA has checked and secured construction equipment at its bridges and tunnels in preparation for the storm, and will monitor them closely throughout. The MTA has also inspected roadway surfaces and drainage systems and checked emergency supplies.

Sophia Cardello, Cari Scanio, Alexa Gentile lift Massapequa

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rain and bothersome mist were constants in Thursday's Nassau Class A girls lacrosse semifinal, but so was Sophia Cardello.
Massapequa's freshman goalie made eight saves and watched as her offense opened the second half on a 6-2 run, resulting in a 12-10 win for the top-seeded Chiefs over No. 5 Oceanside at Adelphi's Motamed Field.
Massapequa will play Thursday's Syosset-Port Washington winner in the county final June 1 at 6 p.m. at Adelphi.
Usually, inclement weather can be a nuisance for goalies and field players alike, but not for Cardello. She said she thrives in the elements. "I've always said to my coaches and my parents that I see the ball better in the rain," she said. "It gets bigger, looks like a beach ball."
And yes, she knows people might think that's against the grain.
"Everyone says that!" she said. "I don't know, I just see it better."
Her saves came from in close and in traffic, but she credited defenders Erin Tierney, Kayla Brady, Kerri Radomski, Francesca Lawless and Jessica Day for her success.
The Chiefs answered emphatically after Oceanside's Kaitlyn Rapp (three goals) tied it at 6. Jackie Gatti scored quickly, and 27 seconds later Moira Callahan (one goal, three assists) found a cutting Cara Scanio (three goals, two assists). Gatti then scored a free position for a 9-6 lead.
Christina McCabe's goal cut Oceanside's deficit to 9-7, but freshman Alexa Gentile netted two of her three and Kate Fiola scored to give Massapequa its largest lead, 12-7, with 6:59 remaining.
McCabe was dynamic throughout for Oceanside (9-7), producing a game-high seven points on three goals and four assists.
Oceanside closed the game on a 3-0 run, but Massapequa (10-5) caused a turnover inside the final minute and maintained possession.
Callahan said Cardello and Gentile have been keys all season. They also were crucial in leading Massapequa to a county title last year, when Cardello starred in net as an eighth-grader.
"We are a lot younger, but we do have experience," Callahan said. "A lot of these young players have been playing since last year and even the year before."
Given all the rain this spring, Cardello said she's felt great this season. She said she hopes it rains in the county final, too.
"I can't see the ball better in the rain," Gentile joked, "but she's amazing, so I wouldn't imagine her not seeing it better."

NY bill would require licensing of dog obedience trainers

Author: Brodsky, Robert

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]20 Dec 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1850295927?accountid=37869

Abstract: Kaminsky called the video "stomach-turning" and said his bill would require the state to create professional standards and curriculum for dog trainers.

Full text:   State Sen. Todd Kaminsky has introduced legislation requiring dog obedience trainers to be licensed after a video went viral this month of a pit bull being aggressively poked with a pole while in a crate at an Oceanside facility.
Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) and Assemb.-elect Missy Miller (R-Atlantic Beach) announced the bill Monday at the Oceanside home of Tommy Marrone, who exposed the abuse on his Facebook page.
Kaminsky called the video "stomach-turning" and said his bill would require the state to create professional standards and curriculum for dog trainers. Dog obedience trainers are not regulated in New York State.
Individuals previously convicted of animal abuse would be denied a license and agencies such as the SPCA would be charged with enforcing violations.
"I was shocked to find that we are totally in an unregulated field where there is no license for dog obedience trainers," Kaminsky said Monday. "There is no one checking the qualifications of such individuals."
Miller plans to introduce a companion bill in the Assembly after she is sworn in next month. "When we go to a dog training facility we should not have to worry if they are licensed or not," she said.
The video, which was posted on Facebook on Dec. 9, shows a pit bull at NYDogWorks in Oceanside cowering and yelping while appearing to be repeatedly prodded by Brian DeMartino, who owns and runs the board-away facility out of his home. The video has had more than 105,000 views on Facebook.
The Town of Hempstead issued multiple citations to DeMartino for illegally operating a business out of his home and construction without a permit.
Efforts to reach DeMartino on Monday were not successful.
Gary Rogers, head of the Nassau County SPCA, said other dogs may have been abused at NYDogWorks.
"This is horrendous and very disturbing," Rogers said. "You don't beat a dog into submission."
The Nassau County district attorney's animal crimes unit is investigating NYDogWorks, a spokesman said.
Marrone said he brought his German shepherd Zeus to NYDogWorks in June. When he picked Zeus up two weeks later, the dog was missing teeth and now suffers from anxiety issues, he said.
Kaminsky said he would reintroduce the legislation, which expires at the end of the year, when the State Senate returns to session in early 2017.

Nassau sheriff stands by jail health care provider Armor

Author: Murphy, Bridget

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Sep 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819243231?accountid=37869

Abstract: First inmate death Records show the sheriff's defense of Armor dates back to an inmate fatality at the start of the public-private partnership.\n

Full text:   Nassau County's top correction official repeatedly came to the defense of the jail's private medical contractor after an oversight agency found the vendor provided inadequate care in connection with inmate deaths, state records show.
In letters to New York's Commission of Correction, Sheriff Michael Sposato defended Armor Correctional Health Services in three of the five cases where the state agency criticized the company after investigating Nassau inmate deaths.
Sposato's letters were an opportunity to comment on state findings that the commission gave the Sheriff's Department - and Armor - before publicly releasing its reports.
The sheriff didn't take a position on Armor's care in the other two inmate fatalities involving state criticism of the medical provider.
But the documents, which Newsday obtained from the commission under the Freedom of Information Law, show Sposato's defense of Armor continued even last summer.
By that time, the commission, which investigates all inmate deaths, already had found Armor provided deficient care in four of those five Nassau jail custody fatalities.
But Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano has touted Armor's contract as a success, calling it a multimillion-dollar savings for taxpayers in every annual state of the county speech he's made since 2012.
Sposato, a Mangano appointee who runs the jail, also has called Armor's contract a boost to public safety because significantly fewer inmates now leave the East Meadow facility for medical treatment.
The for-profit company first won a county contract in mid-2011, establishing a public-private partnership that replaced health care services that nearby Nassau University Medical Center had provided to inmates.
However, Armor - which has defended its medical practices - recently said it wouldn't bid to renew its contract that ends in May.
The company threatened Wednesday to terminate its agreement early and pull out of the jail by Oct. 7 if it didn't get about $2 million in county payments by Friday.
Armor wouldn't comment on its intentions after Nassau Comptroller George Maragos on Friday authorized a payment of about half that amount, after he found the company satisfied his documentation requests.
The conflict began after Maragos' recent refusal to pay two of Armor's monthly bills of about $1 million each until the company provided sufficient data showing it was meeting contract performance standards.
His refusal came after New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against Armor in July alleging that the Florida-based vendor has supplied Nassau inmates with "woefully and dangerously inadequate health services."
The civil action further said Armor defrauded Nassau taxpayers by continuing to collect millions in public money, while county officials failed to take action to enforce terms of the company's contract.
But Capt. Michael Golio, a spokesman for Sposato, said in a recent statement after a Newsday inquiry that the sheriff maintains that inmate health services at the jail have improved since Armor took over.
The statement also said Sposato "stands behind the responses" defending Armor in letters to the state commission.
Mangano's office didn't respond to a request for comment. Armor didn't respond to a question about the sheriff's defense of the company.
In two July 2015 letters, Sposato wrote that "the county remains confident in Armor's experience, credentials and ability to provide appropriate services," at the jail, and "continues to be satisfied with their performance."
He added: "Armor has the necessary protocols and policies in place to ensure quality care, and to quickly identify issues requiring their attention and take corrective measures."
The sheriff's correspondences were responses to the commission's findings that the 2014 deaths of inmates Kevin Brown and John Gleeson "may have been prevented" with proper care.
Besides probing inmate deaths, the commission enforces minimum standards for the care and custody of inmates and can close correctional facilities it finds unsafe.
Gleeson's father, John, a retired FDNY battalion chief, said in an interview that Sposato's defense of Armor appears to be an effort to protect the county from liability.
"This is just dirty politics at its worst. He was just covering the county's backside," said Gleeson, 67, of Oceanside.
The county legislature's minority party leader, Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport), said Sposato hadn't acted in taxpayers' best interests by defending Armor. He added that Mangano, a Republican, was "just as much accountable" for the defense of Armor in the aftermath of inmate deaths.
"I think it was very clear Armor wasn't up to the task. In our opinion, they've been a total disaster," Abrahams said in a recent interview. "I don't see how you could be in the highest position of corrections in the county and back them."
First inmate death
Records show the sheriff's defense of Armor dates back to an inmate fatality at the start of the public-private partnership.
After inmate Roy Nordstrom's June 2011 death, the state commission found in 2012 that Armor had given him "grossly incompetent" care.
It said Armor staff failed to recognize that Nordstrom, 47, was in distress after he complained of chest pains, and didn't get the Shirley man to a hospital for 45 minutes despite a clear emergency.
The commission recommended that Mangano conduct an inquiry into Armor's fitness to serve as medical provider at the jail.
However, a joint letter in July 2012 from Sposato and Armor senior official Karen Davies said Nassau officials were "satisfied" with Armor's "performance, their findings related to the incident and actions taken by them."
In the letter, Armor also called its care of Nordstrom "reasonable and adequate," and said there was no incompetence by its staff.
"We thank you for the opportunity to respond to your report and trust our responses address your concerns," Sposato wrote.
In the Nordstrom case, the county and Armor each sent a letter to the commission after the state agency released its final report.
In those October 2012 letters, Sposato and Davies both contested a claim that the Sheriff's Department had dismissed the state body's recommendation for an inquiry into Armor's fitness to serve as the jail's medical provider.
Both letters ended with an identical sentence: "The county remains confident in Armor's experience, credentials and ability to provide appropriate services" at the jail.
More deaths follow
In 2013, the oversight agency found Armor provided "inadequate" evaluation and treatment in connection with the February 2012 jail suicide of inmate Bartholomew Ryan, 32, an Iraq War veteran.
In a January 2013 letter, Sposato made no comments about Armor's involvement in the case.
But he attached a letter from Davies in which she said a doctor who did a psychiatric assessment of the combat veteran acted "adequately and reasonably."
"There is no evidence that Mr. Ryan exhibited suicidal ideation at any time before the terminal event," the Armor official said.
By then, the county and Armor already had spent months fighting a federal wrongful-death lawsuit Ryan's family filed in 2012.
In 2014, the inmates Brown and Gleeson died in cases that later would prompt the commission to declare Armor had "engaged in a pattern of inadequate and neglectful medical care."
In those 2015 findings, the commission also questioned the company's ability to treat inmates in not just Nassau, but the state. It also recommended that Nassau's legislature investigate Armor's ability to serve as the jail's medical provider.
But Sposato's letters to the state also questioned the commission's authority to make that recommendation. The sheriff suggested the commission was overstepping its authority by trying to call alleged Armor shortcomings to the attention of county legislators.
A sheriff's spokesman told Newsday Sposato "was legitimately questioning" the agency's authority, "as such a directive did not appear to be authorized" under state law.
In nearly identical July 2015 letters, Sposato's defense of Armor in the Brown and Gleeson cases included that Armor was "the most qualified bidder" after a "lengthy and rigorous competitive bidding process."
He added: "Armor submitted a proposal that best met the needs of the department, and which reflected that they had both the resources and stability to sustain a quality and effective inmate health care system at the jail."
By then, Armor's initial two-year contract already had been extended twice - and beyond the time the original agreement allowed for extensions - without the county seeking new bids.
Brown's mother, Queens resident Marcella Brown, 79, said the sheriff's letter to the state about her son's care made her angry.
"They couldn't have been doing a good job," she said of Armor.
Brown's attorney, Joseph Dell of Garden City, said he was "shocked" Sposato would defend Armor.
"He should know in the position that he's in that they weren't rendering quality care," the attorney said, before adding that accountability ultimately rests with Mangano.
Letters from Davies rebutting the commission's findings were attached to Sposato's letters on Gleeson and Brown.
Davies told state officials that their conclusions that Brown's February 2014 death and Gleeson's July 2014 death "may have been prevented" were "presumptuous."
Davies wrote that the death of Brown, 47, of Far Rockaway, "was entirely unrelated to Armor's treatment of him."
The commission found Brown died of heart failure after not getting adequate care for heart disease, seizure disorder and psychiatric problems.
The oversight agency also blamed jail officials for a lapse in the supervision of Brown, whose body was in full rigor mortis when found - a sign he'd been dead more than four hours.
Davies' letter to the commission in Gleeson's case called the 40-year-old Oceanside man's death "a tragedy."
She said Gleeson "had a rare form of a deadly disease about which the medical staff was not informed by history and which was masked by the symptoms of another, much more common condition."
The commission found Gleeson, who had a condition where swelling can lead to breathing emergencies, wasn't sent to a hospital when he first needed it, and didn't get a specialist referral or a correct diagnosis and proper treatment.
Inmates who were on Gleeson's jail tier on the night he died said his throat swelled to shocking proportions, but Armor sent him back to his cell after giving him Benadryl, Newsday reported last year.
The families of Brown and Gleeson also have federal lawsuits against the county and Armor.
State findings in the Gleeson case became public in October 2015, prompting calls from the county legislature's minority party leader and inmate advocates for Mangano to suspend Armor's contract.
Armor's contract says the county can end the agreement for any reason upon 30 days' written notice and immediately for "cause."
But Mangano spokesman Brian Nevin released a statement after the Brown findings became public in November 2015 saying the county attorney's office "opined that the county cannot cancel the contract without subjecting taxpayers to significant liability as the allegations have not been substantiated to date."
The statement also said officials had started drafting a request for proposals to solicit bids for a new jail medical contract - an RFP they issued in March.
State's fifth criticism
In June, the state commission found the May 2015 death of inmate Antonio Marinaccio Jr., 53, "may have been prevented" with proper medical treatment - its fifth criticism of Armor's care after a Nassau inmate death probe.
It also recommended again that Nassau's legislature conduct an inquiry into Armor.
Marinaccio's family, who filed a lawsuit against Armor and the county, said the Levittown man became brain dead after a heart attack in jail.
The commission found Armor failed to provide crucial care and one of its nurses abandoned Marinaccio after he stopped breathing.
But in a May 2016 letter, Davies said the conclusion Marinaccio's death "may have been prevented" was "presumptuous."
A letter from Sposato said an attorney for the legislature's presiding officer, Republican Norma Gonsalves, had started a probe into Armor "some time ago" and was waiting for the commission to provide records in order to proceed.
A Gonsalves spokesman said the inquiry remains ongoing despite difficulties created by the commission providing heavily redacted records - redactions a commission spokeswoman said the agency had to make by law to protect private health information.
In Marinaccio's case, the commission's findings intersected with the state attorney general's probe of Armor - with the case report becoming an exhibit in the July lawsuit against Armor.
Another exhibit in that lawsuit shows Davies said under questioning from Schneiderman's office that Armor didn't fully comply with Nassau contract terms involving quality improvement programs.
She also said Armor hadn't submitted statistics reflecting monthly performance benchmarks since the inception of the company's contract, according to the same court filing.
Records show Davies also told Schneiderman's office that Sheriff's Department employees had said Armor didn't have to provide certain reports or information.
"Armor has no comment on matters obtained through legal filings, but is very focused on the forthcoming legal proceeding," a company spokeswoman said.

Jaime Quiroz's late goal gives Valley Stream Central win

Abstract: Jaime Quiroz deflected Gerry Thermal's free kick in the 79th minute for the winner, capping Valley Stream Central's climb out of a two-goal deficit in the final 10 minutes for a 4-3 victory in a Nassau AA-II/AA-IV crossover.

Full text:   Jaime Quiroz deflected Gerry Thermal's free kick in the 79th minute for the winner, capping Valley Stream Central's climb out of a two-goal deficit in the final 10 minutes for a 4-3 victory in a Nassau AA-II/AA-IV crossover.
Quiroz added two assists, and Thermal netted the equalizer in the 78th minute. Quiroz assisted the goal that sparked the comeback, throwing in from the right side and setting up Olivier Previl's header.
"To be honest with you, I was thinking go for the tie," Valley Stream Central coach Lenny Fiorentino said. "I'm just like let's take the tie. It's Oceanside. They're in first place in the conference."
But even after the Eagles improbably tied the score at 3, they kept applying pressure and earned the free kick in the 79th minute. Quiroz got just enough of his foot on the ball to alter its path and send it into the net.
"I knew the minute Jaime was moving toward the ball he was going to do something," Fiorentino said. "The keeper was moving one way and Jaime deflected it the other way."
Oceanside (2-1-1) eliminated Valley Stream Central (3-1) in a play-in game last year, so the Eagles came out seeking revenge.
"That was the first thing that came to mind," Fiorentino said. "I was like, you know what? This is great because this is a throwback at Oceanside. I'll tell you something, it was incredible."

Two Long Island PTAs win regional awards for reading

Author: Ebert, Michael R

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]09 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827072209?accountid=37869

Abstract: Fenter most recently was assistant superintendent for curriculum, instruction and research in the Oceanside school system, where he also had been middle school principal, middle level social studies supervisor and a social studies teacher.

Full text:   Two Long Island PTAs received regional awards in a contest designed to foster youngsters' love of reading - and one of the organizations went on to win top honors statewide.
PTAs at Oceanside School #5 and Timber Point Elementary School in East Islip were named Nassau and Suffolk county winners, respectively, of Pick a Reading Partner Awards for programs they created to make reading fun and exciting for students. PARP is a New York State PTA program that asks adults to read with children for 15 minutes daily.
Oceanside's program then topped 15 other regional winners last month to take first place statewide. The two-week program, titled "Rocking, Reading & Rapping," strived to show kids that reading can involve formats other than books - such as music and lyrics.
"Music tells a story and kids make their own picture in their heads," said Mary DiGiovanna, the school's PARP co-chair with Frances Cuomo Perpero.
One of Oceanside's highlights was a video titled "What Do You Read?" - a parody of Justin Beiber's 2015 song "What Do You Mean" that featured 20 faculty members who lip-synced the revised words. Their program included visits by 25 guest readers and a day in which students dressed as well-known musicians, such as Elvis Presley and Taylor Swift.
Timber Point's program had a pirate and mermaid theme that featured everything from cardboard boats made from refrigerator boxes to a message in a bottle display showing pictures of the school's 450 participating kids and their reading partners.
"We are very excited about winning," said Marianne Borruso-Gilmore, the school's PARP co-chair with Alyson Ferreby. "We feel is very worthwhile because it inspires reading together."
COLD SPRING HARBOR
New superintendent
Robert Fenter is the new superintendent of the Cold Spring Harbor school district. He replaced Judith Wilansky, who retired.
Fenter most recently was assistant superintendent for curriculum, instruction and research in the Oceanside school system, where he also had been middle school principal, middle level social studies supervisor and a social studies teacher.
He also has been president of the Nassau County Assistant Superintendents Organization and the Nassau County Middle Level Principals' Association, as well as a middle level education liaison for the state Education Department.
HUNTINGTON
New Abrams principal
Donna Moro has been appointed principal of Jack Abrams STEM Magnet School.
Moro served as the science, technology, engineering and math coach and elementary science coordinator for the Huntington school district since 2014. She also taught Earth science at the district's J. Taylor Finley Middle School from 2005 to 2014.
"I am honored and energized to be working with such an accomplished group of professional educators and staff," Moro said. "Together we are dedicated to engaging children in innovative educational experiences and inspiring the next generation of STEM leaders."
SETAUKET
New principal
Kristin Rimmer is the acting principal of Setauket Elementary School. She replaced Nathalie Lilavois, who now is the district's director of elementary curriculum.
Rimmer most recently was assistant principal and prekindergarten liaison of Nassakeag Elementary School in East Setauket. She also has been an assistant principal at Setauket Elementary School and has taught various grade levels at Arrowhead Elementary School in East Setauket.
"As I start this new chapter in my career, I am so excited to return back to Setauket," Rimmer said. "It will be a wonderful opportunity to work collaboratively with talented educators and a supportive community to provide our students with an engaging and well-rounded learning experience."

NISSEQUOGUE
Drivers warned about increased deer activity
Nissequogue Village officials are warning of increased deer activity during the mating season, which lasts from October through January. In a notice to drivers posted on the village website, officials asked drivers to take particular care during dusk and dawn hours, when deer are most likely to cross roads, and to keep alert at all times for movement at the roadside. Deer often move in groups, so drivers who spot one should expect more in the area. Drivers should use headlights and their bright lights.
If you do hit a deer, the notice said, pull to the roadside to assess the situation and activate your hazard lights. If the deer is dead or injured, call 911 to contact the village police, and your insurance company if needed.

HALESITE
Heavy trucks banned
from winding road
The Huntington Town Board has approved an amendment to town code to designate a road in Halesite as unsuitable for use by heavy trucks.
The town board held a public hearing Sept. 27 to consider excluding heavy trucks from using View Acre Drive from Park Avenue to Maple Hill Road.
Town officials said they received a request from a resident for the restriction because of the road's winding layout and narrow width. The entrance to Huntington Hospital's emergency room is on View Acre Drive and is heavily trafficked with emergency and other vehicles. Maple Hill Road already has a similar truck exclusion, town officials said.
The board voted 5-0 to OK the measure at Wednesday's town board meeting.
- DEBORAH S. MORRIS
NORTH HEMPSTEAD
Town to hold hearing on 2017 budget
The North Hempstead Town Board will hold a public hearing today to discuss the adopted budget for 2017. This will be the last hearing before the board votes on a final version of the budget on Nov 1.
Earlier this month, the board presented a $102.7 million budget, which would raise the tax levy by 1.7 percent. The budget remained under the state tax cap of 0.68 percent because of unused allowable levy growth in previous years and tax base growth, town officials said. The spending plan proposes a $67,266,454 million general fund budget and a $35,461,585 million budget for its outside village fund, which serves residents who live or own property outside the bounds of the town's incorporated villages.
The hearing will be held at 7:30 p.m. at Town Hall, at 220 Plandome Rd. in Manhasset.
- CHRISTINE CHUNG
BROOKHAVEN
Montauk Highway
rezoning on agenda
Brookhaven's Thursday board meeting will include more than a dozen resolutions to rezone several sections along Montauk Highway between East Patchogue and Bellport.
A vote to file a grant application with the U.S. Department of Transportation to fund pedestrian improvements along Old Town Road is expected at the 5 p.m. meeting.
Separate resolutions to amend the adopted 2016 budget to increase funding for multiple highway department projects will also be heard.
The meeting will be at Brookhaven Town Hall, One Independence Hill in Farmingville.
- DEON HAMPTON
ISLIP
Sayville to honor
ex-fire chief Sesso
Three blocks in Sayville will be symbolically renamed in honor of Lawrence G. Sesso, former chief of the Sayville Fire District.
The Islip Town Board unanimously approved a resolution at the Oct. 16 meeting to rename Joseph Street from Lincoln Avenue to Johnson Avenue in honor of Sesso.
The lifelong resident of Sayville was a member of the Sayville Fire Department for more than 23 years and was chief from 2009-11. He was also a police officer for both the New York Police Department and the New York-New Jersey Port Authority Police.
Sesso died in 2015 at age 40.

Brothers Garrett and Shane Gibbons lift Massapequa to victory

Author: Ruiz, Mike

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]06 Nov 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1836367959?accountid=37869

Abstract: Considering that Garrett - who also had a 5-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter - had run the wildcat offense with each appearance, Oceanside anticipated a quarterback keeper and defended the run.

Full text:   It was a moment the majority of football brothers can only live out in the backyard.
But for Garrett and Shane Gibbons, this was reality at its finest. Trailing by four with less than 40 seconds left in No. 4 Massapequa's Nassau I quarterfinal playoff game against No. 5 Oceanside, Garrett lined up at quarterback and made some magic by throwing to Shane for a 20-yard touchdown that propelled host Massapequa to a scintillating 31-28 victory.
"I glimpsed and saw Shane," Garrett said. "We've been doing this since we were 3 years old. I just let the ball out and this place went crazy, it was awesome."
Oceanside had upset Massapequa, 31-27, on October 29.
Considering that Garrett - who also had a 5-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter - had run the wildcat offense with each appearance, Oceanside anticipated a quarterback keeper and defended the run. But he had other plans, as he rolled to the right, stopped on a dime and lofted the ball down the right sideline to Shane, who hauled in the game-winning touchdown pass - his first reception of the afternoon - without a single defender in sight.
"I honestly felt like the ball was in the air for 10 minutes," Shane said. "It was crazy. I saw how open I was and knew that if I catch it the game's over."
Everything leading up to the memorable final moments nearly matched in craziness. Back-to-back fumble recoveries that led to two quick touchdowns at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth gave Massapequa (7-2) a much-needed jolt and gave the Chiefs a 24-21 lead. Before the two miscues, Oceanside's defense - led by Jake Lazzaro's two first-half interceptions - had limited Massapequa to just 10 points.
Lazzaro also was unstoppable offensively in the first half, with three touchdown receptions and 184 receiving yards.
Oceanside (4-5) temporarily took the air out of the stadium after receiver Derek Cruz threw a 2-yard touchdown pass with 1:47 remaining to take a 28-24 lead.
Massapequa then executed the two-minute drill almost flawlessly, driving 72-yards behind a combination of Gibbons and starting quarterback Kenny Galvin for the winning score.
"We knew we had a shot," coach Kevin Shippos said.
Massapequa will meet No. 1 Farmingdale in a semifinal Thursday night at Hofstra University.
But until then, the Gibbons brothers just want to soak up the backyard dream that came to fruition.
"It's surreal," said Shane of throwing the winning touchdown to his brother. "These are the moments you play for."

While her teammates were busy celebrating the tying run, and her opponents were busy preparing for the next batter, Kiedaisch was busy charging down the third-base line.
Kiedaisch's heads-up baserunning highlighted a four-run seventh inning as MacArthur defeated Oceanside, 5-2, on Thursday in a rematch of last season's county championship series.
"All I was watching was where the ball was going," Kiedaisch said. "It was perfect timing."
Kiedaisch used to be a righthanded hitter. But because of her speed, MacArthur coach Bobby Fehrenbach converted her into a lefty slapper to give her something of a running start down the line. That speed was on display twice in the seventh inning Thursday.
With MacArthur trailing 2-1 in the top of the seventh, Hannah Rommel hit a one-out single, and went to second on a wild pitch. Kiedaisch then bunted and beat out the throw to put runners on the corners. Shannon Myles walked on four pitches to load the bases for Ashley Budrewicz, who hit a sharp grounder to third. The throw home was bobbled, allowing Rommel to score the tying run and Kiedaisch to advance to third.
Teammates cheered and greeted Rommel near the bench, when seconds later, to their surprise, they were joined by Kiedaisch. Allow her to explain how she got there.
"The pitcher walked toward the plate and the catcher handed her the ball," said Kiedaisch, who gave MacArthur a 3-2 lead. "They were talking and the pitcher was facing the field. Nobody saw me and I ran home."
Gabby DeNunzio and Ali Verdi each tacked on an insurance run. "I had no doubt in my mind that we were going to do it," Budrewicz said. "We are really good in those pressure situations."
As was Budrewicz's twin sister and battery mate, Jessica, who struck out 10 and allowed five hits in the win. Myles' RBI single in the fifth tied it at 1.
Grace Bandini went 2-for-3 for Oceanside, which defeated MacArthur for the county championship last season. She doubled in the sixth and scored on Taylor Eisel's sacrifice fly to give Oceanside a 2-1 lead in the sixth.
That paved the way for the MacArthur rally, and the winning run that few saw.
"Always," Kiedaisch said, "watch the runners."

FEMA cancels superstorm Sandy relief claw back of $5.4M

Abstract: FEMA said the money it wants back is only a fraction of aid provided and the clawback cases represent people who should not have been eligible for a variety of reasons, including that they received duplicative insurance payments, the property was not their primary home or multiple people applied for the same aid from one household. "In general, FEMA will take a little piece of information and sort of run with it and come up with a conclusion that is wrong," said Jonathan Fox, a supervising attorney in the storm response unit at New York Legal Assistance Group, which is helping people appeal disaster case rulings.

Full text:   One dollar of every $5 the Federal Emergency Management Agency demanded back from superstorm Sandy victims has been wiped away after New York and New Jersey residents appealed their cases.
FEMA has stopped trying to collect nearly $5.4 million of $24.69 million in disaster recovery funds that the agency s believed was improperly paid after the 2012 storm, according to new data obtained by Newsday through a Freedom of Information Act request.
On Long Island, FEMA dismissed debt totaling $1.56 million for 216 households, many of them in Long Beach, Massapequa, Oceanside and Lindenhurst.
FEMA spokesman Rafael Lemaitre said in response to questions about the canceled debt that the agency was "conducting an intensive review of all debts" and had removed some because of additional information provided by applicants.
"FEMA has also identified some cases in which the debt was not valid," Lemaitre said. "In these instances, FEMA promptly terminated the debt, notified the applicant and processed a refund for any funds already paid to FEMA."
Lemaitre could not say how many cases were terminated because they were invalid or for how much.
He said the agency is changing its debt collection process before it is certified but could not provide additional details.
"The fact that so many recoupment cases are canceled upon further review only speaks to how burdensome this entire process has been for Sandy victims," said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who with other area politicians is pushing for FEMA to waive debts not involving fraud.
In the aftermath of the 2012 storm, FEMA awarded more than $1.4 billion in aid to help people recover, rebuild and replace losses brought on by the massive storm. Awards were capped at $31,900. In some cases, FEMA wants the entire award back, with interest charges bringing the amount to more than $37,000.
Other federal agencies also gave out money as part of longer term recovery efforts. Aid from those efforts came much later than FEMA's individual assistance.
FEMA said the money it wants back is only a fraction of aid provided and the clawback cases represent people who should not have been eligible for a variety of reasons, including that they received duplicative insurance payments, the property was not their primary home or multiple people applied for the same aid from one household.
But critics say FEMA's attempts to recoup money were often based on bad information or assumptions.
"In general, FEMA will take a little piece of information and sort of run with it and come up with a conclusion that is wrong," said Jonathan Fox, a supervising attorney in the storm response unit at New York Legal Assistance Group, which is helping people appeal disaster case rulings.
Between February 2013 and April 2016, FEMA sent out 3,726 debt letters to households in New York and New Jersey. As of this month, 1,420 aid applicants appealed and 769 of those cases were successful. Of those, 86 percent, or 659, led to debt being completely waived, or zeroed out.
Other cases were modified to lower amounts.
After the appeals process was completed, the amount owed had gone from $5.82 million to $426,728. Cases continue to be appealed and reviewed.
"If there's such a high success rate, it really suggests went out too aggressively," said Will Friedman, acting director of NYLAG's storm response unit.
The data also showed that:
- As of May 9, FEMA wanted to claw back $12.19 million from New Yorkers, including $5.34 million from residents in Nassau and Suffolk counties.
- Long Beach residents owe the most in New York, with $1.24 million in FEMA debt, followed by $454,304 in Freeport, $420,877 in Oceanside, $324,259 in Massapequa and $311,120 in Lindenhurst.
- The U.S. Department of Treasury is attempting to collect $3.79 million in New York, including $1.46 million on Long Island. Depending on the effort involved recouping the money, the agency can assess penalties of up to 30 percent.
- Long Island cases at Treasury range from as low as $13.01 in Cedarhurst to as high as $37,267.01 in Long Beach.
FEMA said it is bound by federal law to recover funds that were paid but should not have been.
Once a debt notice is sent out, recipients have 30 days to pay the debt in full or risk interest charges. An appeal must be filed within 60 days and penalties can begin adding up within 90 days of the initial debt letter. After 120 days, the debt is sent for collection to Treasury, which has the ability to garnish wages, tax refunds and other benefits. Depending on how the agency collects the debt, it can assess penalties of between 28 percent and 30 percent.
Amityville resident Tom Cohill lost two appeals fighting FEMA's demand for $27,000 back because of a duplication of benefits. The retiree opted for payment plan and if he doesn't start paying about $500 a month by the end of May, his case will be sent to Treasury, where it will accumulate more fees.
"I haven't been too successful with anything," Cohill said. "I'm so frustrated."
Advocates and victims say the process can be cumbersome, initial notices of debt do not clearly explain why the money is wanted back, and getting access to personal files is time-consuming, sometimes taking longer than the appeal window.
In some cases, debt letters from FEMA do not get to a person if they've been displaced and they only find out about their debt when Treasury, which has current address information from tax forms, sends a collection letter.
And if a debt is waived by FEMA but Treasury has begun garnishing wages, it can take time to stop collections.
"This is a problem that is beyond annoying," Fox said. "It's a ridiculously Byzantine process, an interagency process."
FEMA said it does not have the authority to waive debt and several bills have been filed to address that.
Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and Reps. Gregory Meeks and Kathleen Rice in New York, and Sens. Robert Menendez and Booker in New Jersey, have pushed for changes and supported bills filed in early 2015 to allow waivers.
"The government shouldn't be clawing back money from victims who have done nothing wrong, victims who have already spent whatever money they received and even gone into debt working to recover from Sandy," Rice said. "FEMA says they want to put survivors first, but in these cases they're telling survivors they owe money with little details about why, denying appeals with no transparency, and sending the debt to the Treasury - basically washing their hands of any responsibility while the government starts taking the money from wages and Social Security checks."
"Sandy victims need our assistance and our compassion, and should not have to be burdened by additional administrative appeals and battles with their federal government," said Meeks, whose house resolution (Rice is a co-sponsor) to grant waivers in certain conditions has been in committee since February 2015.
A bill filed by Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) was passed by the House earlier this year and could provide relief. The measure is part of the FEMA reauthorization bill but it also includes provisions to waive debt made in error, orders the agency to conduct a study on disaster costs and losses, and bars collection efforts from occurring after three years have passed.
A spokeswoman for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the senate said the chairman is vetting several bills relating to FEMA and "discussing reforms with the appropriate stakeholders."
The Barletta bill and one from Menendez are on that list.
"Long Island residents haven't stocked FEMA aid away - they spent it repairing their homes so they could move back in," Schumer said. "I will continue to push legislation that would require FEMA to waive all debt among superstorm Sandy victims, unless clear evidence of fraud is brought to light."
Cohill supports any efforts to change what is happening with FEMA debt such as his own. "Hopefully something else comes along," he said. "I'm going to start paying this. I don't have any other choice."

Survey: Elevated lead levels at 21 Long Island districts: Locations with elevated lead in water shut down or repaired Testing came in wake of metal's high concentration in Flint water

Author: Tyrrell, Joie; Barrios, Jennifer

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 June 2016.

Abstract: Elevated blood lead levels can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, poor classroom performance, and reduced IQ and attention spans in children, who are more susceptible to the harmful effects of the metal than adults because their bodies still are developing, according to the EPA.

Full text:   About 20 percent of the Long Island school districts that said they tested for lead in water at their schools reported finding the metal at levels that caused them to shut down fountains and replace fixtures, according to a Newsday/News 12 Long Island survey.
In the wake of elevated lead levels in the Flint, Michigan, public water supply and in water at schools in Newark, 102 districts took steps on their own to test for lead, the survey found, and 21 reported test results that led them to make remediation efforts.
Lead is not safe for children and can lead to harmful health effects.
Some districts found the elevated levels in work sinks or other areas not used by children, but others reported detecting such levels of lead in water fountains as well.
The districts with results high enough to take action are Bayport-Blue Point, Carle Place, Commack, East Rockaway, Elwood, Jericho, Locust Valley, Malverne, North Bellmore, Northport-East Northport, Oceanside, Plainview-Old Bethpage, Port Washington, Riverhead, Syosset, Valley Stream 13, Valley Stream 24, Valley Stream 30, Valley Stream Central, Wantagh and Westbury.
"Health and safety issues are always paramount to us," said Plainview-Old Bethpage Superintendent Lorna Lewis, who also is president of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents. "We believe that if there is a health hazard, we want to know about it and do something about it immediately."
The recent water testing by Long Island schools comes as local, state and federal officials have urged educators to be more vigilant in testing for the metal.
"I had read about Flint and I jumped on it with my board of education immediately - we were one of the first to get our schools tested," said Peter Scordo, superintendent of the Elwood district. "We were fortunate not to have a lot of exposure, but wherever we had it we dealt with it immediately."
In the past, a school in New York State did not have to test for lead unless it had its own water supply and was not on a public water system. But the State Legislature late Friday adopted a bill that now requires mandatory testing.
Public water suppliers must test for lead and take action to reduce it if the levels go above 15 parts per billion. But in schools, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends remediation be taken if a sample exceeds 20 parts per billion of lead in water.
Ronkonkoma-based Enviroscience Consultants, which has tested between 150 and 200 school buildings on Long Island so far, counts any fixture that measures over 15 parts per billion of lead as an exceedance, while JC Broderick & Associates in Hauppauge, which has tested more than 400 school buildings on Long Island, counts the 20 parts per billion measure as an exceedance. Long Island districts largely have used one of those two companies for the testing.
No safe level
There is no safe level of lead exposure for children, who "can have health effects when exposed to even the lowest levels of lead," according to a May 25 letter from the regional director of the EPA that was shared with districts. Drinking water could account for 20 percent or more of the total amount of lead to which a person is exposed, the letter stated.
Elevated blood lead levels can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, poor classroom performance, and reduced IQ and attention spans in children, who are more susceptible to the harmful effects of the metal than adults because their bodies still are developing, according to the EPA.
But the presence of lead in water in school buildings does not necessarily indicate that every child who has consumed the water faces a health threat, experts said.
"It doesn't mean that anybody who's exposed to lead - because we're all exposed to it - is going to have a health problem," Suffolk County Department of Health Services Commissioner Dr. James Tomarken said. "It's a relative risk kind of situation."
The Newsday/News12 survey found that 102 districts began the lead testing process in the wake of the Flint and Newark findings. Many districts said they are planning to increase routine testing in schools - even if no state legislation is passed into law.
Of the 105 districts that responded to the Newsday/News 12 survey, which began in early May, 66 said they had either tested their water fixtures for lead and were awaiting results, or they are planning to test. Another 36 districts said they had tested and have results in hand. Three districts - Deer Park, New Suffolk and Fire Island - said they do not plan to test their fixtures for lead, and 19 did not respond.
Deer Park reported it uses only filtered or bottled water. Fire Island said it switched to bottled water after superstorm Sandy and New Suffolk said it provides water coolers for its students.
Some districts said they test annually for lead and some reported that they do not conduct regular testing, but added tests this past year and plan to continue in the future. The Franklin Square district, for example, said it is developing a protocol for biannual testing of all drinking fountains. Valley Stream's 24 schools, which initially found five samples above the guideline, retested in May and "everything was fine," according to their survey response.
Water samples at schools should be taken first thing in the morning, after water has sat in the fixture overnight, to find the highest possible levels of lead contamination, according to the EPA.
"If you're the first kid to drink out of that fountain after it sat for eight hours, that's the worst-case scenario," said Enviroscience president and chief executive Glenn Neuschwender.
The presence of lead in a school does not mean it is in the public water supply. The metal can get into water at school buildings by leaching from pipes and fittings in water fixtures, such as drinking fountains and sinks.
Neuschwender said his company has found that 90 percent to 95 percent of the time, fixtures are the source of lead contamination.
But even if water from a fixture tests high, it doesn't mean that those same high levels of lead are being delivered in the water throughout the day, Tomarken said.
"If water sits for six hours or longer and then you open up a tap, the initial rush of water is going to potentially have a higher level than if you let it run for 20 to 30 seconds," he said. "It's an unknown quantity in terms of how much would any particular child be exposed to and what would be their risk."
In addition, there are many different ways children are exposed to lead - including inhalation and ingestion of dust containing the metal, he said. Parents who remain concerned about their children's potential exposure should have their blood tested for lead, he said.
"We think that there's a perspective that has to be maintained about some of these results from the schools," Tomarken said. "People need to discuss them with their personal physicians, and if they're concerned, they want to have testing."
Parent 'shocked,' backs bill
East Northport parent Rachel Friedman said she was "shocked" when she learned that a water fountain at one of her two sons' schools, East Northport Middle School, had lead levels at 19.8 parts per billion.
Friedman said she supports a bill passed late Friday that requires mandatory testing at the tap in schools.
"The most important thing is making sure this problem is corrected if there is a problem in your school district because when it comes right down to it - it is the kids who will be suffering," she said.
The bill, backed by the New York League of Conservation Voters, calls for informing parents and teachers of test results, providing state funds for testing and remediation and requiring the state Department of Health to create an annual report based on these tests.
"No child or school employee should ever be put in jeopardy by tainted water in their school. Testing for lead in drinking water will ensure we jump-start the process of identifying and eliminating such a serious health crisis," said state Sen. Carl L. Marcellino (R-Syosset), chairman of the Senate Education Committee and co-sponsor of the legislation.

Amodio Special to Newsday

Full text:   To say the Rockettes are like family may sound cliched, but for two high-kicking Long Islanders, it really feels that way.
Eleni Gavalas, of Manhasset, and Tara Dunleavy Tubridy, a Queens native now living in Oceanside, first met in 2010 at Nadia's Performing Arts Centre, a Queens dance school. Gavalas, now 23, was a student; Tubridy, 33, an instructor.
"Talk about worlds colliding," says Tubridy, a Hofstra University graduate who has danced with the Rockettes for 10 years. "I was so proud of Eleni when she became a Rockette , and to be dancing alongside her . . . it's just awesome."
Gavalas, Tubridy and 40 other women who make up that iconic kick-line are the focus of the "New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes," an all-new show opening at Radio City Music Hall on June 23 and running through Aug. 7.
Radio City, home of the iconic Christmas show, debuted a "Spring Spectacular" last year, starring "Dancing With the Stars" heartthrob Derek Hough and Tony Award winner Laura Benanti. This year, the Rockettes are headlining, in a revved-up production directed and choreographed by Mia Michaels, known for Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance."
"Mia's pushed us to a completely different level," says Gavalas.
Tubridy agrees. "It's exciting to show our fans contemporary dance styles - besides, you know, the high kicks."
The new "New York Spectacular" tells the story of two kids - Jenna Ortega (of Disney Channel's "Stuck in the Middle") and Lilla Crawford (star of the recent Broadway revival of "Annie" and Little Red Riding Hood in the film adaptation of "Into the Woods") - who get separated from their parents on a trip to New York. Luckily, Rockettes pop up everywhere, guiding the kids on a tour through the city (Empire State Building, Wall Street, Central Park) to reunite them with their family.
"My favorite number is 'Singin' in the Rain,' " says Gavalas. "It downpours - a full-on rainstorm. We're in these awesome yellow rain jackets, we're tapping. It's unbelievable."
Then, in a flash, they whip off the rain slickers and are into their next costumes. "We have eight quick changes in this show," says Tubridy. "The fastest one is just 20 or 30 seconds. We like to say we're as choreographed offstage as we are onstage."
Of course, it's their onstage precision that has made the Rockettes a New York institution.
"To have 6,000 people applauding while you're doing a kick-line - it makes all the hard work worth it," says Gavalas.
"We're strong women, we're friends, we're brand ambassadors," says Tubridy. "I'm just so proud to be a part of it."

For more than 75 years now, motorists headed to Key West have had the additional pleasure of traveling Florida's Overseas Highway, a scenic roadway that traverses some three dozen low-slung tropical islands and 42 causeway bridges in its 113-mile journey southwestward. But in their eagerness to get to hip and happening Key West, most travelers overlook the many worthwhile sites along the federally recognized All-American Road that also serves as the inaugural stretch of U.S. Route 1. Here are 10 stops to consider the next time you take the trip.
Note: Route 1 begins in downtown Key West at Mile Marker 0. Addresses on the Overseas Highway are calculated by how far they are from Key West, with "bayside" referring to the northern side of the road, toward the Bay of Florida, and "oceanside" referring to the southern side, toward the Atlantic Ocean. (Florida Keys and Key West Visitors Bureau, 800-352-5397, fla-keys.com.)
JOHN PENNEKAMP CORAL REEF STATE PARK
Key Largo, Mile Marker 102.5 oceanside
The best place to see the only living barrier reef in the continental United States, which lies three to eight miles offshore, is at America's first undersea park. And if you're not a certified diver, the best way to do it is via 2 1/2-hour or 4 1/2-hour snorkeling tour ($29.95 and $38.95 per person respectively, equipment not included) or a 2 1/2-hour glass-bottom boat tour ($24 adults, $17 ages 4-11). The iconic Christ of the Deep statue is accessible only on snorkeling tours. Likewise, you can explore the park's 50 miles of mangrove swamps with rented canoes, kayaks or paddle boards. Onshore attractions include nature trails, two beaches and a 30,000-gallon saltwater aquarium. Entrance fee $8 per vehicle.

AFRICAN QUEEN, MARINA DEL MAR MARINA
Key Largo, Mile Marker 100 oceanside
Film buffs of a certain age will enjoy checking out the original 1912 "African Queen," the 30-foot steamboat that starred (along with Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn) in the 1951 movie of the same name. You can take a 1 1/2-hour canal cruise ($49) on the boat itself or a 2 1/2-hour dinner cruise ($89, though dinner itself is served in the Pilot House Restaurant).
INFO 305-451-8080, africanqueenflkeys.com
KEY LIME PRODUCTS
Key Largo, Mile Marker 95.2 oceanside
Until the hurricane of 1926, these small, yellowy limes were grown commercially throughout the Keys. Now most come from Mexico, but that doesn't stop local entrepreneurs from cultivating a veritable cornucopia of Key lime products, including candies, cookies, ice cream, tea, jelly, candles and, of course, pie. This colorful, low-key roadside emporium offers a wide selection at very reasonable prices.

ISLAMORADA AND MARATHON RESORTS
Mile Markers 88-57
Lured onward by the night life in Key West, most motorists don't consider overnighting anywhere else. What they end up missing are dozens of all-inclusive beachfront resorts. ("All-inclusive" refers to amenities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, kayaks, paddleboards, snorkeling equipment and bicycles, not food and drink.) Jet skis and sailboats are not included, and there's invariably a resort fee.) Among the best family-oriented options are the Pelican Cove (305-664-4435, pcove.com) and Postcard Inn (305-664-2321, holidayisle.com), both on Windley Key; the Chesapeake Beach (305-664-4662, chesapeake-resort.com) and the Cheeca Lodge (305-664-4651, cheeca.com), both on Upper Matecumbe Key; and the Caribbean-style Hawks Cay (305-743-7000, hawkscay.com) on Duck Key, which even has its own dolphin encounter.
THEATER OF THE SEA
Windley Key, Mile Marker 84.5 bayside
For 70 years now, Theater of the Sea has been entertaining Overseas Highway travelers (especially those in the back seat) with its stunt-studded dolphin, sea lion and parrot shows. Beginning in 1987, it began adding interactive encounters, first with dolphins, and eventually with sea lions, rays, sharks and, most recently, sea turtles. General admission to the grounds and all shows are $31.95 for ages 11 and up, $21.95 for ages 3-10. Encounter prices vary, but the most popular dolphin ones run $195 to swim, $180 to wade and $85 to meet (you don't get in the water). Similar marine mammal encounters can be had at Dolphins Plus, Key Largo (Mile Markers 99.5 oceanside and 102 bayside 305-451-1993, dolphinsplus.com), and the Dolphin Research Center, Grassy Key (Mile Marker 59 bayside, 305-289-0002, dolphins.org).

FLORIDA KEYS HISTORY OF DIVING MUSEUM
Upper Matecumbe Key, Mile Marker 83 bayside
Much of the Keys' early wealth came from salvaging wrecks, and this quirky but comprehensive museum traces the history of diving and underwater exploration in all four aspects: military, commercial, treasure and recreational. Among the many fascinating exhibits are a replica of Edmund Halley's 1691 diving bell, the Mark V Navy helmet and some of the 18th-century finds of local treasure hunter Art McKee. Admission is $12 adults, $6 ages 5-11.
INFO 305-664-9737, divingmuseum.org
PIERRE'S RESTAURANT/MORADA BAY BEACH CAF
Upper Matecumbe Key, Mile Marker 81.6 bayside
The Keys are full of waterfront dining opportunities, but few can hold a Tiki torch to these upscale, adjacent sister properties in Islamorada, offering a charming white-sand beach and wide-open views of island-studded Florida Bay. Take your pick of the two verandas at plantation-style Pierre's or dine right in the sand at the Beach Caf. Both are especially appealing at sunset. Dinner entrees, $26-$55.
INFO 305-664-3225, moradabay.com
ROBBIE'S OF ISLAMORADA
Lower Matecumbe Key, Mile Marker 77.5 bayside
Serious anglers come to Robbie's for some of the best sport fishing in the country, but tourists stop by to eat at the Hungry Tarpon Restaurant, shop at the open-air market and hand feed the 2- to 5-foot-long domesticated tarpon that congregate under the public dock (admission to dock $1, bucket of bait fish $3). Also available are snorkeling tours and a 2 1/2-hour excursion to deserted Indian Key Historic and Lignumvitae Botanical State Parks ($37.50 per person plus a single $7 state park entrance fee).
INFO 305-664-8070, robbies.com
BAHIA HONDA STATE PARK
Bahia Honda Key, Mile Marker 37 oceanside
Among the Keys' most naturally attractive and best maintained beaches are the three in 524-acre Bahia Honda State Park, which allows for swimming, snorkeling and extended beachcombing on both the bay and ocean sides. You also can venture out high over Bahia Honda Channel on the original 1912 rail bridge, which was converted to cars in 1938 before being retired (by having two sections removed) in 1972. Entrance fee: $8 per vehicle.

NATIONAL KEY DEER REFUGE
179 Key Deer Blvd., Big Pine Key; Mile Marker 30 bayside
The visitor center for this sprawling, 25-island refuge devoted to preserving the endangered Key deer is located in the Big Pine Key Shopping Center. Key deer are a variant of the Virginia white-tailed, reduced by the harsh environment to the size of a large dog (roughly 45-75 pounds). To actually see some deer, however, you'll need to walk one of the two nature trails (Jack C. Watson and Blue Hole) located north on Key Deer Avenue or cruise slowly through the nearby residential areas on Big Pine and No Name Keys. Admission is free.

Bubble soccer gives Long Islanders quite a kick: New fad a cross between traditional soccer and bumper cars Players encased in an inflatable plastic bubble

OTHER WAYS TO PLAY BUBBLE SOCCER
GameTruck Long Island
INFO 917-327-8700, gametruck.com

The Long Island Sports Hub
165 Eileen Way, Syosset
INFO 516-364-4000, lisportshub.com
Offers birthday parties, primarily for kids 13 and younger, that include one hour of Bubble Soccer play. Prices start at $845 for a 90-minute party for 13 kids.
Thwack!
Marisa Linares, a 26-year-old accountant from Long Beach, is blindsided. She goes flying, landing with a whomp so loud it makes spectators at the inaugural game of the Long Island Bubble Soccer league cringe.
But Linares isn't hurt - she's encased in an inflatable plastic bubble that surrounds her arms, upper body and head; only her legs stick out from the mid-thighs down as if she is the stick of a human lollipop. She struggles to right herself as other players wearing bubbles race down the field inside East Coast Sports Academy in Oceanside. "It's hard to get up," Linares explains later. "You can't use your hands."
Bubble soccer is a new fad, best described as a cross between traditional soccer and bumper cars. As players chase a soccer ball, they inevitably - or purposely - knock into each other. Because they are top-heavy (the bubbles actually weigh close to 20 pounds), they easily topple, which can be a comical sight. Karen Cicalese, 38, a special-education teacher from Long Beach, says she told her teammates she was afraid she'd be hit and "get stuck on my back like a turtle."
"This is the craziest organized sport I've done," says Joseph Sanfilippo, 31, of Long Beach, who creates educational technology.
A NEW LEAGUE
Bubble soccer got a burst of publicity last year after the league commissioner of the National Association of Bubble Soccer appeared on ABC-TV's "Shark Tank" to pitch it. "It's big for children's birthday parties and corporate events," says Max Feinberg, 32, of Garden City, owner of Let's Play Long Island, an alternative adult-sports company that runs coed kickball and dodgeball leagues.
One of Feinberg's devoted kickball players, Deone Williams, 30, an IT technician from Long Beach, launched Long Island Bubble Soccer in January, hoping to establish league competition for ages 18 and older, and Feinberg's company is helping to promote the effort.
The indoor winter league consists of six coed teams with names such as Bubble Boppers and Screwballs that play every Monday evening for 10 weeks. Each team fields five players, with substitutions allowed during play. A game entails three 10-minute periods alternating with rest.
Williams brings the bubbles and inflates them before games; they have the sturdy consistency of an air mattress even though they look like clear, enormous beach balls. Each has a long, narrow tunnel in the center. "You just kind of crawl in there and wiggle your way on in," says Alan Schoner, 27, of Long Beach, a porter in an apartment building.
Two backpack-like straps hold the bubble in place. "It kind of sits on your shoulders," Williams says. Players have room to bend their arms and hold two handles inside the bubble to help them balance and brace for impact. The top of the bubble is open.
WACKY BUT TOUGH
Seeing through the thick plastic distorts vision like being underwater, players say. It's also difficult to extend the leg completely to kick, because the bubble ends mid-thigh, players say. Teammates wear matching T-shirts, but some players suggest they add matching colored socks to identify each other by their shins.
The sport may be wacky, but make no mistake - it's a serious workout, players say. Playing even for 10 minutes is surprisingly exhausting, they say, comparing each period to playing an entire regular game.
"You can barely breathe in that thing, and you're carrying around that extra weight," says Lauren Sarrel, 29, a special-education teacher from Oceanside. "I've played soccer my whole life and this is exhausting. The sweat is literally dripping down my back."

Abstract: Data from the National Center for Education Statistics were from the 2012-13 school year, the most recent available, and the surveys used data from the 2013-14 school year. The schools then were ranked based on college enrollment rate, graduation rate, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate enrollment, SAT and ACT scores, student retention and counselor-to-student ratio.

Full text:   Twenty-one Long Island high schools are among the nation's top 500, according to Newsweek magazine's annual rankings.
Jericho High School led the group, ranking 27. Jericho is the only Long Island school to break the top 100 this year.
"We always appreciate the recognition from national sources," said Henry Grishman, superintendent of the Jericho school district. "It's a credit to our school community for the tremendous amount of support."
The list, released yesterday, was compiled by Newsweek and Westat, a Rockville, Maryland, research group. The information was compiled from federal databases and surveys, according to documentation released with the report.
Data from the National Center for Education Statistics were from the 2012-13 school year, the most recent available, and the surveys used data from the 2013-14 school year.
Schools first were added to a short list using standardized test performance. The schools then were ranked based on college enrollment rate, graduation rate, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate enrollment, SAT and ACT scores, student retention and counselor-to-student ratio.
Jericho boasted graduation and college-bound rates of 100 percent and a college readiness score of 89.9. The school did not appear on the 2014 list, but it has done well in previous years and found success on other national rankings.
The other schools ranked in the top 200 included Great Neck North High School, at 105; Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK High School at 174; Bellmore's John F. Kennedy High School at 176; and Great Neck South High School at 196.
Newsweek also created a separate list that accounted for poverty within the student body. That list, titled Beating the Odds, included Oceanside High, ranked 207, with 34.5 percent of students living in poverty.
Oceanside officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Full text: Angry about move of seven Isles games
For the second year in a row, the management of the New York Islanders has pulled a bait-and-switch on season ticket-holders ["Coliseum will be home to 28 Isles games this season," News, Sept. 24].
For those like me who live off Long Island, the switch of seven more home games this coming season from Barclays Center in Brooklyn to Nassau Coliseum will cause a financial hardship. When team owner Jon Ledecky told me while shaking my hand at a summer event for season ticket-holders that there would be 20 games played at Barclays, I believed him.
By moving games to the Coliseum, he has increased my cost significantly because I'll have to pay about $85 more for bridge tolls and $140 for parking.
Had I known when renewals for the 2019-20 season came due, I would have gone with a half season at Barclays. Now I can't trust anything they say to me.

'Medicare for All' not a 'far left' idea
Newsday's story on Mayor Bill de Blasio's departure from the presidential campaign described Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as "far-left candidates" ["De Blasio ends 2020 presidential campaign," News, Sept. 21]. This read like a talking point from the Republican National Committee or President Donald Trump's campaign.
According to the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, 53% of Americans support a national "Medicare for All" plan of the type favored by Warren and Sanders. That's hardly far left, with that level of support. Keep the editorializing to the opinion pages.

Ways to cut water use - and cost
I read with interest the Sept. 21 "Just Sayin'" letter "Water rates penalize large households." New York American Water has higher rates than my public water authority, and the reader had my sympathy until I realized how much water her family had actually used in July: more than 40,000 gallons, with more than 25,000 gallons in the top-price tier.
When I had a family of five in my house, we never even approached 100 gallons a day per person, even when filling our pool and watering our lawn and gardens. We are a family of two now and average 30 gallons a day per person.
Here are ways to reduce use: Check to see whether your water system has a significant leak; water the lawn deeply only once or twice a week, and never when it has rained; install low-flow shower heads and limit time in the shower; replace toilets with low-volume models, or install a two-step flusher; run the dishwasher and clothes washer only when they're full; don't let water run when washing dishes or brushing teeth.
In addition to saving hundreds of dollars a month, these ideas can save our aquifer for future generations.
Kathleen Dubuke,
��Farmingdale
��
I, too, was floored when I received a water bill exceeding $600 for August from New York American Water. I called, and the company said my reading was accurate. I admit that lawn-watering was part of the higher use. However, I'm just stuck with the bill. My objection, mostly, is that my balanced budget charge of $23 a month was too low. I have now been advised that my budget rise to $98 a month, which, I think, is very high.
My husband and I raised five children in this house and never even came close to this amount. Now we have two people in the house, and I never expected my bill to go so high.
Doris Lastella,

New York's struggling education system
While I mostly agree with what was said in "Don't dumb down NY's diploma" [Editorial, Sept. 8], I took extreme offense to a sentence that said some teachers want everyone to graduate. Unfortunately, passing everyone is something that some teachers must do to keep their jobs.
I had an assistant principal who was not happy with my passing just 80% of my students (most of them were juniors and seniors who struggled). Being near retirement, I was able to refuse to pass more. Because of the pressure put on teachers, many teach students to pass the test, not to extend their learning. The mentality from the top needs to change.
Linda Silverman,
��Queens Village
Editor's note: The writer taught math at Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows from 1984 to 2011.
��
The dumbing down not only of New York State's high school diploma, but also the general dumbing down of the American education system, will only further exacerbate the woeful ranking of U.S. students behind European and Pacific Rim counterparts.
I believe the misguided opt-out movement also contributes to the dumbing-down process. Life is full of stressful episodes. The earlier youngsters learn how to cope with a stressful situation such as taking a test, the better off they'll be coping with it later in life.

Full text: If former Oceanside resident Otto Delikat was asked how he survived the horrors of Nazi occupation, a year in prison, a deadly disease or five concentration camps - including Auschwitz, Birkenau and Dachau - the self-described realist might say boundless hope kept him alive.
"It was not due to your craftiness or your smartness that you survived," Delikat said during a 1983 interview, housed in the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, in which he described his experiences as an Austrian Jew before and during World War II. "You just had to have a continuous will to survive, to look for tomorrow, and then everything was up to fate or luck, whatever you want to call it."
The Holocaust survivor, who settled in Oceanside in 1957, lived there until 2008 and was a respected businessman and member of his temple, died in an accidental fall on Dec. 23 in Coral Gables, Florida. He was 96.
Luck, fate or something other than Delikat's philosophy may have played a role in sparing him from execution when a German SS guard incorrectly wrote down the identification number tattooed on his arm.
Why, though, did he beat potentially fatal typhoid fever as a Nazi prisoner and why wasn't he executed like so many sick prisoners? Even Delikat was unsure what protected him from the fusillade of bullets fired from a German machine gun trained on Jews like him during a forced dayslong march of weary prisoners from Warsaw, Poland.
Good fortune, though, brought him to a displaced persons camp in Feldafing, Germany, where he met his wife of seven decades, the former Pearl Sofer, herself a survivor of the Auschwitz and Muhldorf camps. She died in May 2014.
Delikat's journey began on Oct. 22, 1922, when he was born in Vienna to David and Janka Delikat.
He attended primary and middle schools, and then a bookbinding trade school before he worked in a brickmaking labor camp in Austria's Carinthia region in the late 1930s, said a granddaughter, Stacey Delikat, a reporter for WNYW Fox 5 News in Manhattan.
Otto Delikat said during the 1983 interview that he was placed in prison in Nazi-occupied Austria in 1940, held for a year and handed over to the Gestapo - then shipped off to a concentration camp in Flossenbürg, Germany, the first of five such camps he would endure.
Auschwitz, Birkenau, Muhldorf and Dachau would follow.
In Auschwitz, he was forced to join a labor group that removed and searched the luggage of incoming Jews as they came off cattle car trains. He recalled a day in 1942 when a dead infant was found in the luggage, and the prisoners decided to give the child a proper burial rather than hand the body over to the Germans who would have thrown it into a crematorium, he said.
"We buried the baby there at the site," he said. "This is one thing that stands out in my mind."
Delikat came quite close to being killed on several occasions, once when he was caught at the Auschwitz camp taking food. The SS guard mistakenly recorded Delikat's tattooed identification number, which was 69840, as 69340.
"When he called out the number inside in the camp, nobody answered," Delikat said. "I wasn't going to answer. I knew he had made a mistake. So, by this slip of one number I survived that day certain death or at least 40 lashes - and that sometimes meant certain death."
On another occasion, in 1944, he was among perhaps thousands of Jews being led from the Warsaw Ghetto, where he had been sent to work as the Russian forces advanced, when German soldiers sprayed the prisoners with machine-gun fire as they ran toward a river to quench their thirst during the dayslong march.
By the time the guns were silent, though, hundreds of Jews lay dead.
After the Allied forces routed Nazi-held cities in Europe, the tables turned for Delikat, so to speak, and he helped the American Counter Intelligence Corps find SS guards in Dachau for war crimes tribunals.
He said he was armed in his new duty as a Nazi hunter, but never took revenge.
"We had guns," he said. "Even though I should have killed everyone I saw I still couldn't do it. ... They were brought to trials and we were at the trials in Dachau, the war crimes trials and everything."
He married in 1945 and the couple had their first child, Janet, in 1946 and immigrated to the United States in 1947. A son, Michael, was born in 1952. When the family settled in Oceanside, Delikat opened Otto Delikat Electrical Contracting.
He was active in his local synagogue, Oceanside Jewish Center, where he worshipped for 51 years. He was named Man of the Year by the temple in 1994 and had served as its chairman of the House Committee.
Delikat collected stamps and assembled an impressive array, his granddaughter said. He loved to sing, joining several choirs, and enjoyed keeping active, playing chess and tennis. He was also a member of Knights of Pythias of Oceanside.
"It will be what it will be," Stacey Delikat recalled as her grandfather's simple outlook on how he survived. "You make the best of it. ... You had to believe, tomorrow will be a better day."
In addition to Stacey Delikat, survivors include daughter Janet Katz of Miami, Florida; son Michael Delikat of Greenwich, Connecticut; three other grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
Services were held on Dec. 24 in Boynton Beach, Florida.

Full text: This wasn't quite how the Oceanside girls lacrosse team drew it up - quite the opposite, actually.
After winning the first five draws of the game and scoring each time, Oceanside struggled from the draw circle. Host Jericho won 15 of the next 20 draws and cut into its first-half deficit, but Lucia Alamia's three goals and four assists helped Oceanside hang on to win, 14-9, Wednesday in a Nassau Conference II clash in windy conditions.
Annelisa Milano had four goals and one assist, including goals that made the score 5-0 and 13-8, the latter of which came with 5:11 remaining.
"I think we stopped being as aggressive as we started out in the first half because we were up," Milano said. "Once they started to catch up, we got our fire back and started pushing the ball more."
Alamia scored three of the first four goals - she assisted the other by Lily Johnson - then Milano capped the early 5-0 run. Oceanside (4-0) closed the quarter on a 4-0 run, taking a 9-1 advantage into halftime.
Jericho (1-3) put the pressure on Oceanside, as Kristina Kallansrude - Jericho's all-time leader in goals and assists - scored four times in the first 11 minutes of the second half, cutting the Sailors' lead to 11-5.
Milano assisted Jamie Mecca for a 12-5 lead, but Jericho cut it to 12-8 when Daria Drew scored twice and Caitlin Chestler added a goal.
"We usually come out really, really strong," Alamia said. "Sometimes, people let it get in their heads. But then we always pull through toward the end and come back really strong. I'm not worried. We did very well today."
Scuffling to solve Kallansrude (six draw controls) in the circle, Oceanside managed to stay afloat by attacking 50-50 balls and creating more possessions. The Sailors had 22 ground balls, led by four apiece from Shannon DiDominica and Bella Klemm. Sarah McCabe and Megan Rugolo each had three.
This created opportunities for a versatile offense with several scoring threats. Even with talented junior Julia Schwasnick sidelined with an injury, Oceanside looked fluid on the attack. DiDominica and Mecca each scored twice.
"Even though we lost a couple of our players due to injuries, I think people started to step up more and become even more aggressive," Milano said. "The ball's really being spread. If you see the scores, it's not just one person scoring or assisting."
Although it's back to the drawing board in the circle, the offense was illustrated as planned.

Ciociano's grab for spotlight: Defensive gem is key to Sailors upending Chiefs

Full text: Matt Ciociano made a spectacular running catch that most players can only dream about. 
With two outs and the bases loaded in the fourth inning, the Oceanside rightfielder tracked a long drive off the bat of Travis Honeyman. With his back to home plate and the ball fading over his right shoulder, Ciociano made a basket catch just before he slammed into the fence and somehow held on to the ball and rob the Chiefs of three runs.
The Oceanside dugout spilled out onto the field to greet Ciociano after he peeled himself off the fence. The defensive gem keyed Oceanside's 7-6 win over host Massapequa in a Nassau Class AA-2 baseball game.
"It's the best catch of my life," said Ciociano, a converted catcher, who made another diving catch in the fifth inning to take an extra-base hit away from Johnny Castagnozzi.
"I've been around baseball a long time and never seen a catch quite like that," said Oceanside coach Mike Postilio. "And he hit the fence so hard and held on."
It was the one play that everyone wanted to talk about it in a game that saw late inning dramatics from both teams. Massapequa, the defending Long Island Class AA champions, showed its resilience when it erased a 5-1 deficit with two outs in the sixth inning. The Chiefs strung together four hits, keyed by a Nick Schwartz two-run double to get within 5-3. Travis Honeyman's single made it 5-4 and Chris DeSousa doubled home the tying run before Joe Reda's bases-loaded walk gave the Chiefs the lead.
But Oceanside would not be denied. The Sailors responded with one out in the seventh. Jake Lazzaro walked, stole second and moved to third on a wild pitch. Noah Eisel laced an RBI single, his third hit of the game, to tie the score at 6. Austin Vlahakis drilled a single, moving Eisel to third, and Chris Siklas lifted a sacrifice fly to regain the lead.   
"We've shown that our lineup is deep and can come back against any team," said Eisel, who also had two doubles. "They're the team to beat and this is a real confidence builder."
Oceanside (8-3) jumped all over Massapequa with a three-run first inning keyed by a Siklas two-run home run for a 3-0 lead. Massapequa (9-4) responded when leadoff man Wade Kelly launched a solo home run to make it 3-1.
In the third, Leo Alvarez crushed a long two-run home run to make it 5-1 and chase starter Chris Prystupka.
 "We showed a lot of character and team leadership coming back in the last inning," Postilio said. "But that catch .  . . wo

'Sisters' off the rails in a good way: 'The Train Girls' rode LIRR into lifelong friendship

Author: Castillo, Alfonso A

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]23 June 2019: 4.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They were hard to miss. In the second-to-last-car of the 7:49 a.m. train out of Oceanside, "The Train Girls," as they called themselves, could easily take up both a four-seater and the adjacent five-seater - and often would spill to a few other rows as well.
As others joined the commuting ranks along the Long Island Rail Road's Long Beach line, the group grew - eventually including about a dozen women. Over more than 25 years, the Train Girls provided the onboard entertainment for some commuters. For others, they were the reason to move to a different train car.
"We were a little loud," said Linda Ficano, 62, of Oceanside, whose favorite LIRR memory involves Mary Musto - a particularly boisterous Train Girl - trying to discreetly share a personal story that she preferred not get back to her husband.
"At the end of it, she said, 'Don't tell Tom,'" Ficano recalled. "And I said, "Mary, the whole frickin' car knows."
Although their friendships were forged inside an electric train car, the bonds the commuting clique formed over almost three decades extend far beyond the rush hours. Through weddings, births and funerals, the Train Girls became as close as sisters.
Although most no longer regularly ride the LIRR, eight of the Train Girls - whose collective commuting careers totaled well over 200 years - recently reunited at the Oceanside station to celebrate a journey that is unlikely to be replicated in the digital age.
"I truly believe this will never happen again, because ... now everybody is like this on the train," Ficano said, mimicking a person buried in a smartphone. "People don't engage anymore. And it's sad that this is going to be lost. Because, that's how we met, but we created such a bond now, train aside."
Although each woman has a different story about how she came to join the group, many point to Judy Moran as the nucleus. It was Moran who struck up a conversation with Ficano aboard a morning train in 1990. Three years later, Musto was walking to her Weidner Avenue home from the train station in a snowstorm when Moran, who lived on the same street, stopped to offer her a ride.
"I couldn't thank her enough. I was probably in high-heeled shoes," said Musto, 58, who began regularly riding to and from the train with Moran. "We were friends from that day on, and never stopped."
"These girls mean so much to me," Musto added. "It's the best move I ever made - walking back and forth on Weidner Ave." 
Over the years, the friendly ladies welcomed more and more people into their circle - all of them easing the stresses of their commutes with conversation, gossip and laughter during their 43-minute ride to Penn Station, not counting delays. Moran called it a daily "therapy session on a train."
"The people around us, they would act like they were annoyed. But they knew everything about us. They knew, 'Oh, so-and-so just had a baby.' They lived vicariously through our stories," said Joann DiMaggio, 58, of Lynbrook. "I used to say we were 'The View' way before there was 'The View.'"
Greeting the Train Girls most mornings and checking their tickets, was LIRR conductor Lou DeBiase.
"I would introduce myself as I went through collecting tickets. I'd see the same people every day and get to know their names ... I remember the group - Linda and Judy and Kathie ... They used to talk about their kids, and so on, and so forth," said DeBiase, 65, who has encountered more than a little cynicism about customer relations in his 19 years working for the railroad. "They said when I came along, I wouldn't like the customers. But I like the customers. I like people." 
And the women liked him - many of them greeting him with a warm "Louie!" as he'd come through the train door, ticket punch in hand.
"He was a very friendly and warm person. He was just like a family member," said Kathie Parise, 66, who commuted on the LIRR for more than 40 years. She said having her friends by her side during much of that time helped "make the train ride go fast."
"If we got stuck somewhere, we had the buddy system," Parise said. "It always helped to have someone."
The women recalled that they weren't the only commuting cliques on their usual train. They talked of fellow passengers regularly taking cardboard poster ads off the train walls to use as card tables. Rose Quaranto recalled that one of the men "always lost."
"And one day, he won. He got so excited, he grabbed my hand and we stood up and we did a Lindy on the train," Quaranto said, referring to a type of jitterbug dance. "I'll never forget that."
As the women grew closer together, inevitably their revelry extended beyond the train. There were Tuesday night card games hosted by Monique Guyonarch at her Long Beach home. There were sleepovers. There were Oscar parties with red carpets and ball gowns. There was a girls trip to Ireland. There was something called a "Bringing Sexy Back Party" that involved taking glamour photos. 
When Musto was diagnosed with a brain tumor years ago, the women organized a benefit banquet to help cover her medical bills.
There was the time when Moran and her first husband, Tom, won VIP tickets to see Billy Joel at Madison Square Garden on New Year's Eve 1999. Preying on Moran's Y2K fears, the women persuaded her to ring in the holiday with them instead.
"They told us, 'Don't go. They're going to blow up the world in 2000,'" Moran said, recalling watching the concert instead on a small TV screen in Cookie Paczkowski's kitchen instead. "Tommy and I got into bed that night and we went, 'We should have went to see Billy Joel.'"
There was the time they went to see "Les Miserables" on Broadway. Ficano threw her uncomfortable shoes in an LIRR station trash can that night. Musto and Moran fell asleep during the show.
"Drool was coming out of our mouths," said Musto who, having turned 55 last week, is the youngest of the group.
Quaranto, who will be 90 this year, is the oldest, but she attests to being every bit as much a "girl" as the rest of them. 
"They were much younger than I am. And they went out to these dances - and I went right along with them," Quaranto said.
With every commuter pass that was purchased, used up and tossed away, another month passed. The women went from attending their children's Sweet 16 parties to attending children's weddings. Musto, who was in her 20s when she first began riding the train with her friends, just learned she's about to become a grandmother. There have been children born, and lost, over their years together.
"Cookie - she has four kids. We felt that she was always pregnant," Musto said. "I was like, 'Oh my God, Cookie. Does it end?' She was, like, always having a baby."
Paczkowski recalled that her fertility came in handy. "I drove everybody after the parties home, because I was the only one that was sober," she said.
The women found comfort in one another, and in their vinyl train seats, during difficult times. Ficano recalled their usually uproarious train conversations being replaced with "very, very solemn ones" in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Several of the women suffered substantial damage to their homes in 2012's superstorm Sandy, which temporarily knocked out the LIRR's Long Beach line. "I remember I couldn't wait for the LIRR to run again, so I could be warm," Ficano said 
The train ride that brought the women closest together was also the most difficult. On a morning in April 2002, Moran, then Judy Rudnic, boarded her morning train at Oceanside with some troubling news.
"When she got on the train she said, 'You know, Tommy never came home last night and I can't get in touch with him,'" Ficano recalled. "And I just had this sinking feeling in my stomach."
Shortly after pulling away from Valley Stream, Moran got the call. "They found him in the office," Ficano said.
Moran's husband had been found dead in his office of an apparent heart attack. As the train seemed to crawl toward Manhattan, Moran's onboard support system sprang into action - enveloping her with comforting hugs, offers of tissues and making calls to children's schools and to relatives. When they arrived at Penn Station, Ficano and another commuting friend, Judy Keith, ditched their jobs and helped contact authorities who put the fraught Moran in a wheelchair and checked her vitals.
Feeling too "undone" to ride the train back home, Moran got a police escort home to Oceanside - Ficano and Keith by her side. Waiting for her at home when she arrived was Musto.
The Train Girls stayed close throughout the ordeal. Ficano would bring pizza to Moran's home every Friday night for her three children. When Moran was ready to return to work, her friends waited for her at the Oceanside station parking lot to walk with her onto the train.
"Even at the funeral, the priest said, 'Judy has the support of all her train friends.' Everybody knew who they were," Moran said. "I tell you, those girls were my anchor ... I wouldn't have gotten through it without them."
Through the years, the Train Girls shrunk in size, as some changed jobs, moved or retired. With Parise leaving her job last month, only one "Girl" remains on the train - Moran.
"It feels sad that we're getting older," said Moran, who now lives in Long Beach and has been commuting on the LIRR since she was 17. "But I still have them."
Although their daily get-togethers on the Long Beach branch have come to an end, the women remain as close as ever - texting, talking and getting together for special events. Ficano, who retired in December, recently reached out to Moran.
"I said, 'It's been a while. I haven't seen you. We should get together. She took it a step further. She said, 'We have a lot to celebrate. We have birthdays. We have retirements. We have new homes. Let's have an LIRR reunion,'" Ficano said. "I said, 'Great idea.' And she reached out to everyone, and everybody could do it."
At the tail end of the evening rush hour on June 14, eight of the Train Girls reunited at the Oceanside LIRR station before going out to dinner. It was the first time in years so many of the women had shared a train platform together. The women quickly began reminiscing, laughing and teasing one another.
Nearby, a few other commuters, presumably awaiting the 7:59 p.m. to Penn Station, sat quietly on benches, gazing into their phone screens.
Ficano offered advice for them and other riders.
"Look up. Smile at each other. Say hello," she said. "You might just be missing out on your next best friend."

America shows compassion to 9/11 victims

Full text: NYPD Officer James Zadroga died 13 years ago.
We knew then that a crisis was underway. First responders and others who had been at the World Trade Center site during and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks were getting sick and dying. But we didn't know how awful it would be -- or how disappointingly long it would take to help them.
While it took more than a decade, Congress finally did the right thing, and President Donald Trump did his part, too, when the Victim Compensation Fund, born from an act named after Zadroga in 2009, was finally made permanent this week. The bill Trump signed Monday poignantly included two additional names -- Ray Pfeifer, an FDNY firefighter from Hicksville who died in 2017, and Luis Alvarez, an NYPD detective from Oceanside who died in June.
The new law permanently funds the critically important compensation fund, essentially creating a blank check to aid tens of thousands of people who headed into harm's way and worked on the tragic site known as "the pile." Perpetuation of the compensation fund and the World Trade Center Health Program, which was permanently funded in 2015, is the least America can do.
More than 22,000 individuals have been awarded money from the compensation fund; another 21,000 claims await decisions. Since February, payments were reduced when the fund ran low. Now, the Justice Department, which oversees the compensation fund, should pay what is owed, quickly. Appropriate administration of the fund and health program should continue, unlike the misguided attempt last year to weaken the health program by moving it out of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
Tragically, many more people will get sick and die. Now, these brave responders and others who suffer know their country will care for them and their families.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The final bell rang at Oceanside High School on Monday, and before long more than 50 teenagers had gathered in a strip mall parking lot a few blocks away.
One was 16-year-old Khaseen Morris. He was told to show up. One day earlier, Morris was seen walking a girl home in their Long Island neighborhood. And it was a problem: Her ex-boyfriend was looking for a fight, police said.
Now Morris was surrounded. A violent melee broke out as a group of six or seven assailants lunged at Morris and a couple of his friends. Other teenagers filmed as boys beat Morris, and then did nothing as Morris lay bleeding on the pavement, fighting for his life from a stab wound to his chest.
The assailants all fled. The videos all circulated.
Morris died in the hospital hours later.
"Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen," Nassau County Police Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick said at a news conference Tuesday. "They would rather video this event. They videoed his death instead of helping him."
On Wednesday, 18-year-old Tyler Flach was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in Morris's death, the Nassau County Police Department said in a statement.
The case is the latest example of a brutal beating captured on video and turned into entertainment on Snapchat and other social media platforms, leaving a digital footprint of a violent tragedy. Fitzpatrick spoke directly to the teenagers who filmed, admonishing them for standing idly with their cellphones as one of their peers died. The videos have helped police identify most of the assailants, Fitzpatrick said. But still, he said, there should never have been Snapchat videos of the high school senior's killing.
"I don't know what to make of it, my generation versus this generation," he said of the phenomenon. "This can't go on. Your friends are dying while you stand there and video it. That's egregious."
Fitzpatrick said Tuesday that police were still seeking more information on other attackers, who are believed to be from multiple local high schools.
Friends, family and classmates gathered in the strip mall's lot for a vigil Tuesday night. In an interview with Newsday, Morris's older sisters described him as free-spirited and artistic, an aspiring photographer who liked to draw anime and write his own music. He dyed half his dreadlocks burnt orange, and rode his skateboard around the neighborhood blasting a mix of rap and punk music from his speakers. The family had just moved to Oceanside from neighboring Freeport, N.Y., and Morris's sister, Keyanna Morris, said he finally felt like he fit in.
"When he came here," the 30-year-old told Newsday, "he was able to be his kind of different with no judgment and he loved it. The moment he stepped foot in Oceanside, everyone loved him."
But then came a fight over a girl — all because Morris walked her home. His sisters said the other boy began sending threatening messages before school that morning, leading to the fight later that day.
"Him being so nice, that one good deed that he did got him killed," 22-year-old Kedeemah Morris, his sister, told the New York Times.
In recent years, everything from fatal overdoses to wild fights in broad daylight have wound up on Snapchat and Facebook and YouTube. Last month, a 14-year-old died of an apparent drug overdose while other teens filmed his distress at a skate park in British Columbia and took pictures, saying, "Carson almost died LOL." In 2017, a man was beaten to death with a glass liquor bottle in the middle of rush hour in Chicago as people drove and walked by — or stopped to record a video, the Daily Beast reported. None intervened to help.
"This is the society we live in now, where things like this sometimes become the next viral video," a Chicago police officer told the Daily Beast at the time.
In Morris's case, eventually, the video made its way to his family. Keyanna Morris wept as she recalled watching her brother bleed out on the ground, Newsday reported.
"He was in so much pain," she said.
Correction : A previous version of this article incorrectly reported Morris's class at Oceanside High School. He was a senior.

Ryder: 1st stab report was taken wrong way

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder Tuesday night said initial police reports of 50 to 70 youths at an Oceanside strip mall watching while a 16-year-old high school student was fatally stabbed in an after-school fight were misinterpreted.
Police, following the killing of Khaseen Morris earlier this month, had initially said dozens of teenagers recorded the fight on their smartphones, instead of helping Morris, leading to viral media attention. Homicide Chief Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick had said at the time:  "Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen. They'd rather video."
But Ryder, speaking to more than 300 people at a community forum at Oceanside High School sponsored by police and titled the "Dangers of Social Media," said only about 20 kids were watching the fatal fight, and as few as two videotaped it.
Residents told Ryder they were upset their community was being "vilified" by the impression that Oceanside students were indifferent to the victim.
Manuel Rodriguez, 54, of Oceanside, who has a son in his senior year at the high school, said he was dismayed that no one intervened. "Don't stand there and watch it," he said. "Help. ... It's a kid. Do something."
But other residents disagreed.
Allison Glickman-Rogers, principal of Oceanside Middle School and mother of four children, ages 5 to 17, said "I'm telling my kids, you see a knife, you see a gun, you run," to loud applause. "You run to the nearest store, you run to the nearest building. You get out of there."
Steven Ballin, 71, of East Rockaway, who said he was in the parking lot in his car when the fight occurred, told Ryder he was glad he clarified the number of people who were watching the fight unfold. "I don't want the parents or family [of Khaseen] to think that there were 50 to 70 students who did nothing" Ballin said in an interview.
Ryder said that when Fitzpatrick made those comments, it was "a very emotional time, a very, very fluid time." He had meant to emphasize the importance of sending police videos of the stabbing, Ryder said, but "It didn't come across that way."
Ryder told the crowd that "two to three kids videotaped that incident as it went down," although he clarified in an interview after the forum that police do not know the number of people who videotaped the fight, only that police have recovered only two videos.
"Nobody volunteered those videos for us," he said. "We had to find them and get them."
Ryder said 14 people called 911 during or after the fight, including three who were put on hold for about 30 seconds because of the volume of calls and two who hung up.
Tyler Flach, 18, of Lido Beach, was indicted Tuesday in connection with Morris' death. He had been initially charged with second-degree murder. The indictment is sealed and the charge or charges are not yet public. Flach pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on Thursday. He is being held in jail without bail.
Prosecutors have said that Flach and a group of about seven others went looking for Morris on Sept. 16 because the ex-boyfriend of a girl Morris was friendly with believed Morris was dating her. Morris had told him they were just friends and he had only walked her home from a party, at her request.
Ryder reassured residents that the killing was an isolated instance and that their community is safe.
"Was this gang-related, or do we have a gang issue in Oceanside?" asked Eric Donato, 48, of Oceanside, who said his daughter, a sophomore at Oceanside High, had heard rumors of gang involvement.
"This was not gang-related, and you do not have a gang problem in Oceanside," Ryder assured Donato

ARRESTED IN $45G ELDER SCAM: POLICE SAY BRONX MAN MIGHT HAVE DEFRAUDED OTHERS ON LI

Full text: A Bronx man caught on surveillance video allegedly scamming a senior woman in Oceanside out of $45,000 was  in custody Thursday - thanks to the public's help - and police believe he may be responsible for more similar scams.
Frederick Espinal, 23, is charged with four counts of third-degree grand larceny in connection with the Oceanside case as well as a similar one in Lake Success, police said. He is under investigation for his potential role in three other cases involving victims in Roslyn, Great Neck and Oceanside, as well as two in Farmingdale, that bilked residents out of nearly $65,000. 
"I'm happy he's caught," the 81-year-old Oceanside woman whose electronic doorbell caught the Dec. 3 scam on video said Thursday, declining to give her name. "I'm happy that I could help and that he's caught." 
Nassau County Executive Laura Curran and Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder previously implored the public to reach out to police with information about the then-unknown suspect. They doubled the usual reward to $10,000 and called him a "dirtbag" and a "piece of garbage"  at a news conference on Dec. 7.
Tips flooded in, helping police discover Espinal's identity and lead them to his Ford Fusion in the Bronx, as well as tie him to a similar scam in Lake Success. Espinal had fled to Lawrence, Massachusetts, where he was arrested Tuesday afternoon. He will be arraigned Friday at First District Court in Hempstead. 
"Our wonderful police department got the dirtbag," Curran said Thursday at a news conference. 
Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said Espinal's arrest meant "Christmas came early" for the department. He added that Espinal has been called lots of names but "now we get to call him defendant." 
"It shows you how easy it is to scam someone," Ryder said after the news conference. "Why would you rob a bank?"
In Oceanside, Espinal allegedly called the woman and said her son had been arrested after a car crash and needed $7,500 for bail. He came back to her twice more, claiming first that the bail had been doubled after a pregnant woman in the crash lost the baby and then that $30,000 was needed in medical expenses.
"He smiles when he's getting handed that money," Ryder said.
In the Lake Success case, Espinal allegedly bilked a senior woman out of $12,500 in September. He has admitted to the Lake Success and Oceanside scams, Ryder said.
Police earlier said they believe Espinal scammed a Roslyn senior out of $30,000, a Great Neck senior out of more than $5,900, another Oceanside senior out of $8,430, a Farmingdale senior out of $20,000 and tried but failed to take $9,000 from another Farmingdale senior, police said. He has not been charged in those cases but police are working to determine whether Espinal was responsible. 
Ryder said these types of investigations are difficult to close and it's rare to arrest a perpetrator.  Authorities urged other potential victims of other scammers to come forward.
"These cases are quite difficult," said Albert Teichman, Nassau's chief assistant district attorney.
Anyone with information can call Nassau County Crime Stoppers at 800-244-8477. All callers wi

Tommy Heuer, Derek Cruz and Owen Glascoe complete flea flicker that won L.I. the Empire Challenge: Coach Rob Blount called the familiar play with two of his Oceanside players in the game on fourth-and-14 that resulted in winning touchdown

Full text: Take the old-school flea-flicker, add a touch of the new-wave spread and you've got the makings of a dramatic plot twist under the Friday night lights of Hofstra's Shuart Stadium.
That's the play that Long Island offensive coordinator Rob Blount of Oceanside called in the final minute of the 23rd Empire Challenge. "We just call it 'throwback,' " Blount said.
Long Island's offense - mostly revolving around Dylan Laube of Westhampton, who ran for three touchdowns out of the Wildcat formation, accumulated 151 all-purpose yards and was voted most outstanding player of the game - had bogged down late in the fourth quarter with the score tied. After two first downs rushing and a big 21-yard completion from Lindenhurst's Nick Anzalone to Laube that put the ball at the NYC 30, Laube lost 4 yards and Anzalone threw two incomplete passes.
On fourth-and-14, it was time for a little deception before the reception. Blount called a play that was familiar to the three primary participants, with mixed memories. "We used it in the regular season and we used it in the playoffs," Blount said. "Then we ran it a few times in practice."
Oceanside players started the action, with receiver Derek Cruz going in motion and taking a handoff from quarterback Tommy Heuer in the familiar shotgun-spread alignment. Cruz faked continuing the run and tossed the ball back to Heuer, who waited for Massapequa wide receiver Owen Glascoe to break free.
Heuer hit Glascoe in the end zone for a 34-yard touchdown pass and Farmingdale's Briant DeFelice added his fourth extra-point kick for a 28-21 lead with 41 seconds left. That was the winning point in a 28-27 thriller.
"I was in the slot and came in motion like a jet sweep," said Cruz, who caught four passes for 36 yards. "I faked the run and threw it back to Tommy. We've done it plenty of times before. It worked against Massapequa."
That was a gentle, smiling dig at Glascoe, standing next to Cruz and Heuer on the Hofstra turf after the game. Oceanside successfully pulled off the throwback for a key touchdown in a 45-21 opening-day victory over the Chiefs on Sept. 7.
Glascoe was quick to laugh and embrace his new "teammates."
"That's why it felt so great, because they did it against us," he said of his only reception Friday night.
Glascoe dropped the ball on the same play in practice a couple of times, according to Blount, but like all good receivers, he has a short memory.
"You can't think about that," he said of those agonizing seconds looking up into the lights waiting for the pass to come down. "When they went after Tommy, I knew the play worked and I started sprinting to get open."
He caught the pass cleanly from Heuer, who threw 38 touchdown passes last fall and won the Thorp Award. "I had to move to the outside to avoid the rush," Heuer said. "I saw Owen ahead of everyone else. I just threw it."
His ninth completion in 19 attempts was right on target and produced the 34 yards necessary for a victory that gave Long Island a 13-8 lead in the series and ended New York City's winning streak at two games.
The City nearly made it three in a row, driving for a touchdown on a shocking Hail Mary pass of 30 yards on the game's final play. NYC elected to go for the win rather than kick the PAT and force overtime, but Sayville's James Lyons batted away the two-point conversion pass.
"What a way to win a game," Long Island coach Bill Parry of Westhampton told his players.
And what a way to end a career. Parry, who announced his retirement last fall after the school's first Long Island championship, had coached his last football game - a Friday night delight.

Full text: Model Bella Hadid posed with Oceanside High students Monday at a private party before the school's prom that evening.
"She was not at the actual prom," Oceanside School District spokeswoman Donna Kraus told Newsday, saying that the frequent Elle, Vogue and Glamour cover girl had appeared with students "at a private pre-prom party. There was some connection among people who knew her and knew some of the families involved."
A Bella Hadid Instagram fan site on Monday had posted two photos captioned "#BellaHadid on a school's prom bus today." One showed Hadid, 21, posing with 18 students in prom gowns and tuxedos inside a party bus. In the other, she posed outdoors with three young women in prom gowns. Elle and other fashion magazines identified Hadid's attire as a black Juicy Couture tracksuit.
Some Twitter users also commented, with one asking, "Why is Bella hadid in my town? and at prom?"
Hadid did not post on social media about her visit with the Oceanside students, and a representative for IMG Models, her agency, did not respond to a Newsday request for comment. 
Hadid was photographed outside her Manhattan apartment on Monday, and either she or someone managing her Instagram account posted from Cancun, Mexico, later the same day. The model appeared to post herself from Frankfurt, Germany, on Tuesday, writing "Only 7 hours here but loving you! This is our last stop of the #DiorBackstage collection tour. Thank you all for coming! Much love," and from Rome on Wednesday.

Magician clown cast funny spell

Full text: Edmund Tester, known to countless fans as Jolly Jazzbo the Magic Clown, entertained Long Island children for half a century.
From his first appearances at Century's Route 110 Drive-In Theatre in Melville in 1957 to the World's Fair and parades, Jazzbo became a prominent, colorful character. 
Tester died Dec. 7 at the Nesconset Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation. A daughter, Teresa Carter, said the cause was congestive heart failure. He was 91.
At the Melville drive-in, Jazzbo rode a miniature train and performed simple magic tricks before the evening movie started. Families would bring children in pajamas, said Carter, of Lake Ronkonkoma. Her father's job was "to tire the children out, basically."
That gig led to others at Long Island All Weather Drive-In theaters, at hotels in the Poconos and Catskills and at affluent homes. "If a child sees a clown at someone else's party, he wants something equal at his own," Tester's wife, the former Margie Ruth Fletcher, told Newsday in a 1964 story about high-end children's parties.
Tester drove to many jobs in costume in the Jazzmobile, a converted street-legal Ford Model A with a clown horn. He later downgraded to a mini car with a lawn mower engine.
In 1961, Tester bought the former Kiddieland on Long Beach Road in his hometown of Oceanside to create Jazzboland. Jazzbo appeared there on weekends until Tester took a regular gig at the World's Fair in Queens in 1964.
By 1968, Jazzbo was a regular on what Newsday called the "playground circuit" of municipally funded appearances in Nassau County. He made at least one appearance at a rally for President Richard Nixon in 1972. He appeared at parties and parades until the early 2000s.
"I left my audience laughing. I was happy," he told Richard Woods, the author of a 2013 book, "Legendary Locals of Oceanside."
Edmund Anthony Tester II was born in Brooklyn on May 13, 1927, to Edmund Tester, a bus driver, and the former Louise Germain, a homemaker. He attended Oceanside High School and, after Army service, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan in the late 1940s.
He married Margie Fletcher in 1946. She would later appear alongside him as Princess Pain in the Neck. Their children also appeared in the act, playing characters he invented.
Tester was a page at NBC in the early 1950s when "Howdy Doody" producers hired him to appear as Clarabell, the star clown. "He had to sign a waiver saying he'd never disclose he did personal appearances throughout the tristate area as Clarabell," Carter said.
"He was paid as a nonunion employee to cut costs," $25 per week, she said. "Once he became his own clown" as Jazzbo, Tester commanded $25 per performance or more.
Though not the only clown named Jazzbo, Tester got his name from being called a jazzy beau in high school, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a bow tie and stripes over plaid, Carter said. Jazzbo's style was Tester's, amplified to ridiculousness: the bow tie grown to the size of a ceremonial check, patterns in pitched battle, his shoulder-length red wig brushed horizontal and topped with a tiny hat. Finished with greasepaint makeup, the costume took an hour to assemble.
Some of his tricks involved a succession of trained rabbits named Snowball. He would make them appear, disappear and bring his magic wand. Sometimes this worked; sometimes Snowball "would take the wand and throw it off the table." Either way, the bit killed.
Tester grew upset when the honor of his trade was besmirched, Carter said. That included the 1988 release of horror comedy "Killer Klowns from Outer Space" and the 1990 "It" miniseries, which he thought "hurt the true, real clowns."
"He claimed he was born to be a clown," she said. It meant nothing when someone "put on a colorful costume and face paint and calls himself a clown... . Your personality has to be a clown."
Besides Carter, Tester is survived by daughters Margret McKeever, of Selden, and Cindi Scibelli, of Texas, and sons Michael Tester, of Medford, and Steven Woolworth, of Los Angeles. He was predeceased by his wife, Margie, 80, in 2009 and by their son, Edmund Tester Jr., of Holtsville, in 2012.
He was buried Thursday at St. Charles Cemetery in East Farmingdale.
In the early days, Jazzbo sometimes appeared with Bozo the Clown, played then by Bill Britten. "When you think about it, it's odd to have two clowns," Carter said.
Her father, though, distinguished himself because he was "a talking magician clown. He never did any of the pie in the face tricks or trip and fall," she said. "He gave the clown some dignity. That's how h

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Maggie Goodwin of Oceanside found out she was pregnant after trying for a second child for more than five years, she and husband, Craig, were so happy they spread the news in their Christmas cards.
Their joy turned to despair when their daughter, Emma-Méabh, was stillborn.
"I spent over 36 hours delivering her lifeless body and had to walk out of the hospital with empty arms," said Maggie Goodwin, 39.
To cope with their loss, the Goodwins sought support from the New York Metro chapter of the Star Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to raising awareness about stillbirth as well as other kinds of neonatal deaths and miscarriage. Maggie Goodwin is now a chapter volunteer.
"I made a promise to my daughter that I'd make sure her life mattered and made a difference," Maggie Goodwin said. The couple has a son, William, who is 8.
A driving force in the chapter, which will have its first gala in June, is Mark Donohue of Rockville Centre. He helped start the group after his wife, Amanda, 38, delivered their stillborn daughter, Jane Elizabeth, in 2015.
"It just put me in a daze," said Mark Donohue, 39, who is a New York City firefighter. "I was in a fog, a real fog - it was very dark."
The Donohues, who have two daughters and a son - Nora, 8, and Lucy, 6, and 15-month-old Matthew - didn't know what to do next when the stillbirth happened and he didn't want other parents like them to feel they were alone with their loss. One in every 160 pregnancies in the United States every year ends with a stillbirth, according to the foundation.
"I want to help other people through that," Donohue said. "These parents need support."
The Donohues along with the Goodwins expect to attend the gala, "A Night Under the Stars," on June 2 at Captain Bill's in Bay Shore. The evening will include cocktails, dinner, entertainment and raffles.
On Saturday, the chapter is putting on its third annual "5K Run/Walk Let's Not Be Still Festival." The event starts at North Hempstead Beach Park in Port Washington.
Both events will raise money for outreach, education, research, prevention and family support.
To register for the run/walk, go to www.letsnotbestill5k.org. Tickets for the gala can be purchased at starlegacyfoundation.org/ and click events.

Children average 3.4 hours daily on electronic devices, poll finds: The survey, commissioned by South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, found kids under 18 on Long Island and in New York City are spending that time on smartphones, tablets, computers and televisions

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Children under 18 throughout the metropolitan area are logging substantial amounts of time on electronic devices with 65 percent riveted to screens in excess of three hours daily and 22 percent glued to devices for more than five hours a day, a new public health poll has found.
The attraction: Games, cartoons, texting, chatting, surfing - immersion into cyberspace.
"As a pediatrician I was aware that kids were spending time on these devices, but it is really shocking to me to see the number of hours that were found in this poll," said Dr. Warren Rosenfeld, chairman of pediatrics at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside.
The survey, commissioned by South Nassau, found that children on Long Island and in New York City are spending an average of 3.41 hours per day of nonacademic screen time with devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers and televisions. The phone survey of 600 parents of children younger than 18 was conducted for the hospital April 9-12 by LJR Custom Strategies, a professional polling corporation with offices in Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.
Children, the poll found, have distinct preferences about the types of devices they use.
Seven percent use a desk or laptop computer as their primary screen. More than 90 percent preferred logging time on smartphones, tablets or sitting in front of a TV, the poll revealed.
Details of the survey were to be discussed Thursday morning at the hospital.
"Human contact is lost when too much time is spent with a device," Rosenfeld said. "They are not outdoors running, playing and enjoying the 3-dimensional world." Instead, some youngsters are becoming too focused on activities involving 2-dimensional images emanating from devices, and parents are not doing enough to wean their kids from the cyberworld, Rosenfeld said.
The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016 cautioned that too much screen time - especially in young children - can delay cognitive, language, social and emotional development.
Children of all ages are attracted to electronic devices. For the youngest - ages 2 to 5 - academy pediatricians recommend limiting screen time to no more than one hour per day of high-quality programming.
The organization also has developed guidelines to help parents oversee device usage and warned that inactive periods spent with electronic devices may play a role in childhood obesity.
Despite the academy's recommendations, the South Nassau poll found that fewer than half of parents surveyed knew about the guidelines and only 13 percent had heard about them from a pediatrician.
Beyond the academy, the National Sleep Foundation has cautioned against too much exposure to the bright, short wavelength light emitted from screens, which is called "blue light."
Blue light exposure just before bedtime "can delay the release of sleep-inducing melatonin, increase alertness, and reset the body's internal clock," according to the foundation, referring to the body's natural circadian rhythms.
Dr. Lauren Hale, a professor of family and preventive medicine at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, told Newsday in 2015 that a book before bedtime is a healthier alternative to electronic devices because of blue light exposure.
The South Nassau's poll, however, found some parents deem themselves ineffective at curtailing their children's screen time.
For example, 25 percent of parents reported their screen-limiting efforts as very successful. Sixty-two percent of parents said they do not use parental control settings designed to limit screen time.
"Smartphones and other devices obviously are essential now in most families, but we need to understand that while there are positive benefits, there can also be negative effects on healthy social development. Moderation is key," Dr. Adhi Sharma, South Nassau's chief medical officer said in a statement Wednesday.
The survey, meanwhile, is South Nassau's second this year and the sixth in a series of quarterly Truth In Medicine polls, which the hospital began last year. The surveys question people on Long Island and in New York City about critical medical issues that affect large segments of the population. The aim of the polls is to help spur public education to improve public health, Rosenfeld said.
South poll finding
- Average Long Island/New York City household has three smartphones, 2.89 televisions, two tablets and 1.65 computers
- More than 90 percent of children prefer to spend their screen time on smartphones and tablets or in front of a TV
- 51 percent of parents with children 6 and under say they use parental controls to monitor their children's screen time.
- 36 percent of parents with teens try to limit screen time
- Parents who restricted youngsters' screen time or used parental controls are more likely to eat dinner together

Oceanside's Kasey Cohen and Sayville's Colin Macy-O'Toole spend six weeks as part of a hardworking yacht crew based in Naples, Italy

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Not all islands are created equal. Long and Fire are both great - but Capri, off the Amalfi Coast of Italy? As both Kasey Cohen, of Oceanside, and Colin Macy-O'Toole, of Sayville, discovered as part of a yacht crew on Bravo's "Below Deck Mediterranean," some islands are eye-lands, with views like nowhere else on Earth. Season 3 of the reality series premieres Tuesday at 9 p.m.
"We did a lot of island hopping," remembers Cohen, who served as third steward, the lowest rank, on the luxurious 177-foot Talisman Maiton during the six-week production last year. "Sticking out to me most was a chairlift you would take to get to the top of this mountain," she says of the lift up Monte Solaro on Capri. At nearly 2,000 feet, the views of Mount Vesuvius, the Bay of Naples and the Amalfi Coast were "stunning, breathtaking," the 25-year-old says.
"We were stationed at Naples," recalls Macy-O'Toole, 30, a deckhand, "but we would go to Capri, Positano on the Amalfi Coast, and the island of Ischia. You get to enjoy the scenery, though you're working your ass off almost every hour of the day. But that whole area is beautiful," he says. "Even though I was working hard, I would take a minute or two, look around, enjoy where I was. I had one of the best experiences I'd ever had in my life."
Those experiences included starting at the bottom. At 15 he had started as a deckhand for Sayville Ferry Service, which runs to Fire Island, but eventually earned his 100-ton master's license and for years has served as a captain. On this luxury yacht with multiday charters, however, he was a deckhand once again. That meant a lot of mopping, wiping down surfaces and whatever other odd jobs needed done - "cleaning, setting up picnics for the guests."
As for Cohen, "I was third stew, so my duties were laundry, cleaning and making and turning down beds. On occasion I would do either breakfast, lunch or dinner service when they needed me." She also learned too late she was prone to seasickness.
Her parents are software-salesman, Jeff, and stay-home mom Gisselle, a native of Bogota, Colombia. Cohen attended Oceanside High School and earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Stony Brook University in 2015. During college she began working for a charter-yacht company she declines to name, explaining, "If I go back there, I don't want people coming to see me" and gawk after her TV stint.
Macy-O'Toole, whose parents Robert and Robin are musicians and music teachers, graduated from Sayville High in 2005, then earned a bachelor's degree in music education from Shenandoah University, in Virginia. He's now back at work at Sayville Ferry.
And the two Long Islanders did bond - though only as "really good friends on the boat," says Macy-O'Toole. Ah, the dreaded friend zone. "In a good way!" he says, laughing.
"It was nice to have a little taste of home with me," Cohen says of Macy-O'Toole. But you know how it is - "He's Suffolk, and I'm Nassau."

Mike Grisanti helps Massapequa win Class AA Game 1: Year after being cut from team, gets final out of game

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mike Grisanti got cut from the Massapequa varsity baseball team last year. He was crushed.
He made it his goal to make the team in his senior year.
The Chiefs are happy he did.
Grisanti, one year removed from the heartache of being told he wasn't good enough, stood on the mound at SUNY-Old Westbury with Game 1 of the Nassau Class AA championship hanging in the balance.
Here was Grisanti, the ball in his right hand with two outs and runners on first and second in the bottom of the seventh inning and Massapequa clinging to a one run lead over Oceanside.
"I dreamed of this moment," Grisanti said. "Let it be me. Let me be the guy in the toughest situation with all the pressure and watch me get the job done. Sure, I was disappointed last year but I always believed in myself."
Grisanti threw an inside fastball and jammed Chris Siklas, who grounded to third baseman Johnny Castagnozzi, who stepped on third for the final out as Massapequa edged Oceanside, 6-5, in the Nassau Class AA finals.
"We couldn't believe we had to cut him last year," said Massapequa coach Tom Sheedy. "It's to his credit that he worked his tail off to come back, make the roster and put himself in a position to play. And he's so mature and the perfect guy for these pressure type situations."
Grisanti had come on with a runner on first and no outs in the seventh. He walked the first batter before getting the next two outs, including a strikeout. With runners on second and third, Leo Alvarez popped a two-run double barely inside the rightfield line to make it 6-5. Alvarez had two hits and all five RBI for Oceanside. Dylan Judd was intentionally walked setting up the final out.
"I used to watch the varsity when I was in middle school," said Grisanti, who also served as the designated hitter and contributed a run-scoring single. "And I couldn't wait to be a part of it."
Oceanside opened the scoring in the first when Jake Lazzaro doubled and scored on a one out single by Alvarez for the 1-0 lead. Massapequa responded with a three-run second inning. James Zupo walked to lead off and scored when Castagnozzi launched a triple to right centerfield. Castagnozzi, a North Carolina verbal commit, scored on a Grisanti single for the 2-1 lead.
Oceanside turned a 5-4-3 double play to erase Grisanti but the Chiefs weren't done. Wade Kelly singled, stole second and scored on an Aidan Cooney single.
"Castagnozzi is young and coming up and he's something special," Sheedy said. "The ball just jumps off his bat."
Oceanside cut the deficit to 3-2 in the third inning. Lazzaro led off with a triple and scored on Alvarez one-out groundout. But Massapequa upped the lead to 5-2 in the fourth. Grisanti walked and moved to third on a Mike Moreno double. After one out, Sheedy went to the bench and called on pinch hitter Travis Honeyman. He came through with a two-run double to left to make it 5-2.
"I was so nervous but so focused when I stepped into the box," Honeyman said.
The Chiefs extended the lead when Aidan Cooney was hit by a pitch and moved to second when Phil Cottone dropped a sacrifice bunt down the third base line. Nick Schwartz drilled a long run-scoring double to centerfield for an insurance run in the top of the seventh.
"Huge win for us," Castagnozzi said.

Oceanside man admits Ponzi scheme of nearly 5 years: Assistant U.S. Attorney Artie McConnell told the judge that John Quadrino, 52, defrauded investors out of about $3.5 million

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An Oceanside man pleaded guilty Tuesday to running a Ponzi scheme that, prosecutors said, bilked dozens of investors out of millions of dollars over nearly five years.
John Quadrino, 52, who had promised investors profits on their investments in his precious metal businesses, which did not exist, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud before U.S. Magistrate Arlene Rosario in Central Islip.
Quadrino admitted that he used the money he got from new investors to pay old investors and his personal expenses. There were 84 victims, prosecutors said at the time of Quadrino's arraignment on Mar. 30, 2017.
"I apologize for my actions," Quadrino told the judge.
In exchange for his admission of guilt, prosecutors dropped the remaining charges, five counts of wire fraud.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Artie McConnell told the judge that Quadrino defrauded investors out of at least $3.5 million. Under the sentencing guidelines, McConnell said, Quadrino's potential prison term could be 51 to 63 months.
Quadrino's attorney, Joseph Conway of Mineola, disputes the loss claimed by the government, and said his client's potential prison term is 33 to 41 months.
"We believe some of them are not victims or they have been paid back more than the government is crediting," Conway said in an interview afterward.
A sentencing date has not been set.
Quadrino was arrested after two investors filed complaints with the Nassau County district attorney, according to a source familiar with the case.
At the time Quadrino was indicted, prosecutors said he ran two companies - Princess Cut Industries Inc. and Golden Glitter Trading Inc. - from his home on Henry Street. Quadrino was one of three partners in Sassy Jewelry Buyer Inc., based in East Meadow.
The companies held themselves out as gold traders that claimed to buy large amounts of gold, jewelry and diamonds, and sell them to refineries and jewelers.
In all, the companies collected $13.1 million from investors, including four residents of Jericho, Seaford, Westbury and Upper Brookville from September, 2011 to December, 2016, according to the indictment. The investments ranged from $40,000 to more than $100,000.
Although the indictment mentioned that "others" took part in the scheme, Conway said no one else has been charged in connection with the fraud.
Investors were not named in the indictment.
An Oceanside woman who appeared in court and asked not to be identified, said she and her husband lost money in the scam. When the couple asked Quadrino for their money back, "He told me 'Bear with me. I am moving money around,' " the husband recalled in an interview later. "That's all he kept telling me."

Full text: Oceanside's Andria Scaglione has fully embraced the track and field lifestyle. Because, at its highest level, that's exactly what it is - a lifestyle. Track isn't just a show-up-and-race kind of sport. Not for those who succeed in the postseason. And Scaglione has every intention of continuing to make waves as the postseason progresses.
Fresh off a victory in the 3,000 meters at the Nassau Conference I meet, Scaglione won the two-mile in 11 minutes, 2.28 seconds at the Ocean Breeze Invitational on Jan. 28 at Ocean Breeze Athletic Complex on Staten Island.
The victory was a gigantic confidence booster heading into the Nassau Class A Championships, held Tuesday night at St. Anthony's High School - and it showed. Scaglione won the 1,500 meters in 4:52.72 and placed second in the 3,000 meters in 10:29.44 at the championships.
In the past, the junior has been frustrated with the stagnant nature of her times late in the season. She plateaued too early, she said, not able to shave off those last few seconds when they mattered most.
But that's all old news. Scaglione's entire outlook on the sport, and what goes into fast times and gold medals, has changed and, as February deepens, she's seeing the results.
"I've been able to manage my time right, been going to bed at the right time and eating right," she said. "Now that I'm older, I've been doing harder workouts and practicing every day, opposed to past years where I've been like 'oh, it's OK to skip a day.'"
"Now, I feel like I'm taking it a lot more seriously, where I've incorporated it into my everyday life," she added. "Not only running, but the way I carry myself throughout the day. I track what I'm eating to make sure I'm caring about what's fueling my racing."
Some of her favorite training meals include avocado toast and eggs.
"I do this every day and then, during practice, I'm able to get the most out of the workout," she said. "When it comes to race day, I'm more prepared."
Being in optimum racing shape allows Scaglione to think more on the track. She can devote more time to strategy and less time to laboring through tired muscles. Her Ocean Breeze Invitational victory was a perfect example of this, with Scaglione recognizing that the pace was too slow for her liking and making a move to lead halfway through the race.
"I was trying to keep consistent 40 or 41 ," Scaglione said of when she decided to leave the pack in the dust. "At that point, the pace was getting to 43 . Then I decided to go."
Scaglione, as she hoped she would, kept to a 40-41 pace for the final eight laps. Her two-mile converted time (10:13.4) hit the state qualifying standard for the 3,000 meters, meaning she only has to place third at the Nassau State Qualifier, scheduled for Feb. 13, to make March's state championship.
"This season, I feel like I'm getting more confident with my ability," she said.

Full text: Some guys stole hearts on Valentine's Day. Nassau County police say Joseph Ravenell stole packages.
Ravenell, the latest suspect arrested in a crime trend attributed to thieves known as "porch pirates," is charged with seven counts of petit larceny, all in the theft of packages from homes in Rockville Centre, Oceanside and South Hempstead on Wednesday, police said.
Ravenell, 26, of Martin Luther King Drive, Hempstead, was arrested after being caught on video surveillance "removing packages from several residences and placing them into a maroon Chevrolet Monte Carlo," police said.
The thefts occurred on Columbia Road, Harvard Avenue, Hempstead Avenue, Terrell Avenue and Dartmouth Street in Rockville Centre, as well as on Cedar Street in South Hempstead and Windsor Place in Oceanside.
Police did not disclose the items taken or their value. It also was unclear if any of those items were recovered.
Ravenell is scheduled for arraignment Friday in First District Court in Hempstead.

Winter Olympics: Oceanside's Devin Logan misses cut in women's halfpipe: Logan finished 15th after falling near the end of her second qualifying run

Full text: Devin Logan failed to advance to the finals of the women's freestyle skiing halfpipe competition at the Olympics early Monday in South Korea, falling near the end of her second and final qualifying run and finishing 15th.
Logan, who grew up in Oceanside before moving to Vermont for high school, needed to finish 12th to reach the finals Tuesday in South Korea, and she was on the bubble after the first round in 12th place after posting a score of 71.60.
But near the end of an otherwise clean second run, she took a tumble and received a 25.60 score. Other skiers surpassed her 71.60 on their second runs, pushing her out of the finals.
Logan's parents, Jerry and Nancy, were in Pyeongchang for the competition. Nancy fell to her knees in disappointment after watching Devin's fall.
Two days earlier, Logan had finished 10th in the slopestyle event - on her 25th birthday. She won a silver medal in that event in Sochi in 2014.
Logan was the only freestyle skier to compete in both the slopestyle and halfpipe competitions in Pyeongchang.

Isaiah Bien-Aise helps Westbury pull away: The Green Dragons' senior forward had to play conservative on defense with four fouls, but still scored 12 points in fourth quarter against Oceanside in Nassau Class AA quarterfinal

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was as if Isaiah Bien-Aise had to play defense while wearing handcuffs. Hard to lock down your opponent when you are under lock and key yourself.
"At the beginning of the fourth quarter, I got my fourth foul and I had to be conservative," the 6-4 Westbury senior forward said. "But I still had to be aggressive on offense and on the boards."
Bien-Aise was anything but passive, scoring 12 of his 29 points in the final period and keying a clinching 10-0 run late as host No. 4 Westbury pulled away from No. 5 Oceanside, 75-55, Wednesday afternoon in a Nassau Class AA quarterfinal.
The Sailors surged to within 58-50 after two straight layups by Brian Pod and there were nearly five minutes remaining to complete the comeback. But Bien-Aise, who also snared six rebounds, scored on a baseline drive to restore order.
Pod (10 points) hit a jumper in the lane to make it 65-54 with 2:47 left but the Green Dragons finished with a flourish. Jalyn Dunlap (18 points, seven rebounds, three assists) scored on a breakaway dunk and Bien-Aise followed with eight straight points, including four free throws, a layup and his own dunk, to send Westbury (12-8) into Monday's semifinal against No. 1 Uniondale at 5 p.m. at Farmingdale State. Oceanside finished 13-7 and got 14 points from impressive 6-8 sophomore center Jake Tavroff.
Point guard Jordan Redd, who also played the fourth quarter with four fouls, scored 18 points and delivered seven assists as Westbury kept the ball moving on offense. "It's a like a virus," Dunlap said of the team's unselfishness. "It spreads to the rest of the team. If everyone is in the game on offense, it makes it tougher for defenses to stop us."
Westbury likes to employ an aggressive, full-court, trapping defense that turns steals into transition layups. Redd and Dunlap both pick-pocketed the Oceanside guards in the open court for easy baskets. "We stress defense in practice," Dunlap said. "We like to run and we know we can't run if we don't get stops."
Westbury first-year coach Jason Bryant said his team "looked good offensively" but had to back off a little defensively at times because of foul trouble. "We had been able to put on the press right after a basket, but we had to get a little conservative," Bryant said.
Of Bien-Aise, who was watched Tuesday by several college coaches, Bryant said, "He's the engine that drives this team."
It's a team that defeated Uniondale in last season's county final and then stunned Half Hollow Hills East in the Long Island championship on a buzzer-beating putback by Dunlap off a missed free throw. But after last year's scoring leaders Jonathan Dean and Darius Young graduated, Bien-Aise acknowledged, "Everybody thought we'd crumble this year. We wanted to prove we're still a top team."
The Green Dragons are looking forward to Monday's rematch with Uniondale. "We know we're the underdogs," Dunlap said, "but we like it that way."

Leaders react to swastika found painted on Oceanside sidewalk: Police are still searching for whoever spray-painted a swastika and lewd graffiti outside two homes this week

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hempstead officials and Oceanside community leaders decried a swastika spray-painted on a sidewalk this week and advocated for ending symbols of hate speech.
Town Councilman Anthony D'Esposito gathered Thursday with residents, Jewish war veterans and rabbis on Lincoln Avenue, urging the public to come forward to help identify the vandals who drew a swastika and lewd graffiti on residents' fences.
"The graffiti found in Oceanside was criminal. Our township is home to many World War II veterans and others who endured the horror of Nazi death camps," D'Esposito said. "Swastikas have no place in a free, democratic society."
Residents of two homes found the graffiti Wednesday morning. Nassau County police were continuing to search for evidence Thursday and looking for any home security cameras that may have captured the vandalism.
D'Esposito said some have speculated the graffiti could have been done by teens off from school during winter break, but he urged they be identified so they can be taught the atrocities of the Holocaust and the meaning swastikas carry. He said if it was done with malice, the vandals should be caught and punished.
"There's nothing funny about displaying the swastika," D'Esposito said. "It is a symbol of hate and a reminder to so many of a dark time in our history."
Rabbi Levi Gurkov, of Chabad of Oceanside, said Oceanside was a community of tolerance but would not stand for symbols of hate to be displayed.
"We're here to say we're not going to tolerate that or stand by in silence," Gurkov said. "If we all just educate ourselves a little bit that every single human being has an intrinsic value to give to society, then we dissipate all the hate and there's no room for anger or animosity because we love each other."

'TRYmester: Jewish Fertility Journeys Out Loud' play about infertility comes to Oceanside: New work includes elements of dance, poetry and storytelling

Author: Whitehouse, Beth

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]28 Feb 2018.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Most people going through fertility challenges don't break into song about the process, but that's what will be happening on March 3 when a new play called "TRYmester: Jewish Fertility Journeys Out Loud" comes to Long Island for one night only.
One piece, for instance, is called "Thank God I Went to Kindergarten," lyrics exploring acronyms associated with fertility journeys, says Ariel Warmflash, community programs manager for the Initance Project, the theater group that co-created the show. It features mainstream acronyms such as IVF as well as acronyms such as TPR - third party reproduction, such as when a donor egg gets involved - and TTC - trying to conceive, she says.
"That is a moment of levity in the piece," Warmflash says. "It's not a comedy; it's not a tragedy. The goal of our project has been to create an original piece of theater that would get audiences and the community talking about fertility."
The one-hour show, which will also include dance, poetry and storytelling, is scheduled for 8 p.m. at the Barry & Florence Friedberg JCC in Oceanside. Afterwards, there'll be a 30-minute panel discussion, says Marcy Hallerman, senior program director at the JCC.
The event is a kickoff for follow-up support groups and related programming to be offered at the Oceanside JCC as well as through the Mid-Island Y JCC in Plainview and the Marion & Aaron Gural JCC in Cedarhurst. The project is spearheaded and co-created by Uprooted: A Jewish Response to Fertility Journeys, an organization that works with Jewish families on their experiences with fertility. It is funded by the UJA Federation of New York.
"It showcases the challenges that individuals going through fertility issues go through, the emotions," Hallerman says of the show. "It's a very different way of bringing awareness to this. When we heard about the opportunity to get involved with this, we jumped."
After playing in Oceanside, the show will repeat on March 4 in Westchester and March 7 in Manhattan, Warmflash says.
Tickets are $18 each. The Friedberg JCC is at 15 Neil Ct., Oceanside. For more information, call 516-766-4341 or visit friedbergjcc.org. To buy tickets, visit https://www.wizevents.com/register/register_add.php?sessid=9794&id=5765

South Nassau submits plans for South Shore medical facilities

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]10 July 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1917278175?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: South Nassau Communities Hospital officials have submitted their latest plans for a $279 million project to establish a permanent emergency room in Long Beach and expand the main hospital in Oceanside.
Building applications and documents needed to begin the state environmental quality review process were submitted Friday to the City of Long Beach and the Town of Hempstead's Board of Appeals, marking the beginning of a potential 18- to 24-month process before South Nassau can begin construction on either site.
Hempstead Town officials said the board does not comment on pending zoning matters, but the town has contracted an engineering firm to conduct an environmental report on the project.
In a statement, Long Beach City Manager Jack Schnirman said the city had received the environmental documents, and "will be starting our due diligence and review."
"These projects represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve health care for the South Shore of Nassau County for decades to come," South Nassau's president and chief executive Richard J. Murphy said in a statement.
Hospital officials will hold a series of community meetings in Oceanside and Long Beach starting this week to hear resident input on the project, with a look at what specific services will be provided. The sessions will be held Tuesday and Thursday afternoon at the hospital's conference center in Oceanside, and at the Long Beach Public Library July 19 and 25.
The project is split into four parts: creating a Long Beach Medical Arts Pavilion at the site of the former Long Beach Medical Center; building a four-story addition to the Oceanside hospital; raising and upgrading that hospital's electrical grid and infrastructure; and building a three-story parking garage in Oceanside.
The project uses $154 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency money, which Congress granted to South Nassau after the Long Beach Medical Center was flooded during superstorm Sandy in 2012. South Nassau purchased the hospital, which had declared bankruptcy, two years after the storm.
South Nassau plans to invest $108 million of its own money for hospital improvements, in addition to FEMA reimbursements.
FEMA approved an alternative use plan last year for South Nassau to use $45 million of the FEMA dollars to build a permanent 25,000-square-foot emergency room and medical arts pavilion 23 feet off the ground at the site of the former Long Beach hospital on East Bay Drive. The remaining FEMA funds would go to Oceanside.
A Long Beach group, the Beach to Bay Civic Association, has a federal lawsuit pending against FEMA, disputing how the money was allocated, and demanding funding instead be used to return a full-service hospital to the barrier island.
A study last year showed a rebuilt hospital in Long Beach would lose $11 million per year and was not likely to draw enough patients to attract top-level medical staff, said Joe Calderone, South Nassau's vice president for communications.
The Medical Arts Pavilion plans include radiology and rotating specialists for cardiology and urology. Officials are seeking regulatory permission to add on-site dialysis. The pavilion would be equipped with a space for a medevac helicopter and would add to an existing floating dock, added last year by the Town of Hempstead, for marine access to the bay.
South Nassau upgraded the city's urgent-care center in 2015 to accept 911 calls and ambulances at the site of the former hospital. The current stand-alone emergency room since has treated 18,000 patients, 87 percent of whom did not need to be transferred to a hospital, Calderone said.
Hospital officials are planning to use $113 million, including the majority of FEMA funding, to make a four-story addition to the southwest part of the Oceanside hospital, Calderone said. Hospital officials said the addition will best serve residents on Nassau's South Shore and residents in Long Beach.
An emergency room expansion for South Nassau will be about the length of a football field, but keeps the hospital capacity at 450 beds. The resulting larger ER could treat 30,000 more patients a year and increase the ICU capacity to 40 beds.
South Nassau officials said the renovations will add two floors of critical care and create nine new 600-square-foot operating suites with robotics and diagnostic equipment.
The hospital will use part of the FEMA funding toward infrastructure improvements costing $93 million, including raising the electrical grid above the ground floor and hardening it for storm protection of generators, heating, ventilation and chilled water.
Additionally, the hospital plans to float bonds to cover a $28 million three-story parking garage to create 400 new spaces and alleviate parking on neighboring streets, Calderone said.
There is no estimate when the projects would be completed, as it could take up to three years for permits and construction plans to be finalized, hospital officials said.

Donald Norkett dies; former Newsday photographer, editor was 84

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald Norkett, a former Newsday photographer and photo editor whose other jobs spanned from Army combat medic and welder to taxi driver and private investigator, died Aug. 8 at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside.
He was 84. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Alice Norkett, 74, of Merrick.
"He was always looking for another adventure," she said. "He could do anything he set his mind to."
Born on Dec. 1, 1932, in Astoria, Norkett grew up in Queens, New Jersey and Roosevelt and received his GED from Hempstead High School. He was drafted in 1952 during the Korean War and served as an Army combat medic and staff sergeant.
After his military service, Norkett built houses, worked as a welder for then-Republic Aviation Corp., drove a taxi and dabbled as a private detective, Alice Norkett said.
He started in journalism as a photographer for the now-defunct Long Island Press. When that publication folded in 1977, he was hired by Newsday to cover "sports, spot news, weather shots. In those days, they did anything and everything," Alice Norkett said. He lived in Deer Park and worked in Suffolk County.
His first wife, Myrna Aims, became very ill and they moved upstate to Theresa, where Norkett briefly ran a general store. Aims died in 1977 and Norkett returned to Long Island and Newsday, where Alice Mann worked first as a secretary to the photo editor and later in the editorial department writing listings.
They had met right before Norkett moved upstate and reconnected when he returned to the Island.
"He was irresistible, he was interesting," she said. "He could do everything."
Norkett became a photo editor for Newsday in the 1980s because he "got tired of carrying that big bag of equipment," Alice Norkett said. "He was a purist. He didn't like to change what was real in a picture."
He worked for The National Sports Daily for about a year and a half before it folded in 1991. Norkett went on to work for Eastman Kodak, frequently traveling both domestically and internationally for the company, where he remained until his retirement in the early 2000s when he was in his 70s.
In retirement, he became a gardener and a prizewinning fisherman, constructed a koi pond, carved wooden figures and painted, among other hobbies. At one point he hunted, but stopped because "he liked to capture them on film instead of catching them in the wild," Alice Norkett said. He also had a pilot's license and became "a major computer buff."
"Anything he could touch, he could do," she said.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children Donna Bucaro of Hauppauge, Darlene Brown of upstate Liverpool, Dawn Dugan of Nantucket, Massachusetts, Donald Norkett Jr. of Syracuse, Douglas Norkett, also of Syracuse; stepson Brendan Mann of Merrick; a sister, Eileen Gettys of upstate West Henrietta; 14 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
His funeral is to be held at 9:45 a.m. Monday at St. Barnabas the Apostle Roman Catholic Church in Bellmore.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The similarities are uncanny. Two head coaches in their fourth season at the helm, two programs on the rise in a classic matchup to headline this week's football schedule.
Say hello to the undefeated football teams at Half Hollow Hills East and Centereach. Both squads, mirror images of one another, are off to 4-0 starts and meet in the Suffolk II game of the week at 1:30 p.m. Saturday in Dix Hills.
"It's an exciting time for this side of the Half Hollow Hills district," Hills East coach Mike Maratto said. "We're having success and the players believe in what we're doing. It takes a few years to turn a program around. We were at the bottom when I took over and the plan was to change the attitude and the culture about football here. Our first year we set a foundation and we've been building from there. This senior group was my freshman group."
Hill East has never started a season 5-0 and the Thunderbirds have never won a regular-season crown. Both of those achievements are within reach behind the senior leadership of halfback / linebacker Drew Martin, halfback Ernesto Mitchel, quarterback Jay Spinelli and wide receiver / cornerback Kendall Nero-Clark.
Centereach is on a similar path to the postseason. The Cougars only regular-season title was in 1979. And the Cougars have never won a playoff game.
"Both of our programs have been on the rise," Centereach coach Adam Barrett said. "We made the playoffs last year and we've seen more dedication from our players. The system is all new and the players have been putting in the time in the spring and summer getting to understand the offense and the defense."
Centereach has the highest scoring offense in Suffolk II with 129 points. And the Cougars defense has allowed a division-low 27 points.
The Cougars opened the season with a thrilling 18-12 overtime win against intradistrict rival Newfield. It was the first win over Newfield since 2004. The Cougars have rolled with halfback Alec Kiernan leading the way with nine touchdowns.
"That opening win was tricky and so important," Barrett said. "It was a rivalry game which always evens the playing field and we had to come back to win it. Our defense really came up big."
Both coaches agree the more physical team will win this one. Centereach has shut out Hills East two years in a row.
"Kiernan is a very special player and we have to stop him," Maratto said. "He gets those critical yards after contact and refuses to be tackled. That's a huge key here. And we need to solve their defense."
Other games . . .
Carle Place/Wheatley at Cold Spring Harbor, Friday, 6 p.m.: Cold Spring Harbor (4-0) came away with a 21-7 win over previously unbeaten Seaford (3-1) last week. Can the Seahawks stop Carle Place/Wheatley (3-1)? The Wildcats are led by halfback Luke Caliendo, who has six touchdowns.
Freeport at Oceanside, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.: This Nassau I matchup could be filled with big offensive plays with Freeport halfback Aaje Grayson (7 TDs) and Oceanside quarterback Tommy Heuer, who's thrown for 15 scores. Can Oceanside stay undefeated?
St. Anthony's at Hayes, Saturday at SUNY-Maritime, 4 p.m.: St. Anthony's quarterback Greg Campisi ran for two scores and passed for another in last week's 35-13 win over Farrell. The Friars (3-1) face undefeated Hayes (3-0) in a pivotal game in the CHSFL's AAA Division.

Long Beach to pay rest of $3.5M to man run over by police SUV: Oceanside resident was in a lounge chair when the officer drove over him while responding to a report of a swimmer in distress in 2010

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Beach City Council members will vote next month to pay the remainder of a $3.5 million judgment awarded to a man who was run over on the beach by a city police officer in 2010.
Marshall Starkman, then 43, of Oceanside, was lying on a lounge chair when he was struck by a Long Beach police Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle driven by Officer Paul DeMarco, who was responding to a swimmer in distress on May 26, 2010.
Starkman suffered three broken ribs and three fractured vertebrae. He also had a degenerative spine condition with several herniated discs and an abrasion to his heart, causing an irregular heartbeat, his attorney, Neil H. Greenberg of Westbury, said.
"That day was right before the unofficial start of summer on Memorial Day weekend. He was sitting in a beach chair with a radio next to him listening to the Mets game," Greenberg said. "Then the officer saw someone in the water was swimming to a jetty and the officer turned his head and ran over him."
A Nassau County jury awarded Starkman $2.2 million in 2014 after a monthlong trial. Damages included medical expenses, future loss of earnings and $750,000 for pain and suffering, plus interest.
Starkman appealed to the New York Appellate Division in Brooklyn, arguing the judgment was not reasonable compensation for his pain and suffering. A four-judge panel ruled in March that Starkman was entitled to an additional $1.3 million for his injuries.
Starkman underwent two multilevel cervical fusion surgeries nearly two years after the accident and still suffered neck and back pain. The court ruled the jury's award "deviated materially from what would be reasonable compensation."
"He doesn't know how it will affect his life and the limitations on the rest of his life warranted a larger verdict," Greenberg said. "He still has positive outlook and feels lucky to be alive."
Long Beach City Council members will vote Dec. 5 on $656,000 in bonds to cover the remaining amount owed as part of the judgment against the city. The bonds will pay the portion of the judgment not covered by the city's insurance policy.
Long Beach police were involved in a similar accident in the summer when a police pickup truck ran over two people on the beach. Long Beach police Officer David Walpole said he did not see the couple lying on a blanket while making a three-point turn at less than 5 mph the evening of July 16 as he responded to reports of after-hours swimmers. The unidentified victims were a man, 48, and a woman, 36, officials said. The man suffered broken ribs and bruised lungs and the woman injured a leg and broke a finger.

Two Long Island PTAs earn regional awards for reading

Author: Ebert, Michael R

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]09 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827072183?accountid=37869

Abstract: PTAs at Oceanside School #5 and Timber Point Elementary School in East Islip were named Nassau and Suffolk county winners, respectively, of Pick a Reading Partner Awards for programs they created to make reading fun and exciting for students.

Full text:   Two Long Island PTAs received regional awards in a contest designed to foster youngsters' love of reading - and one of the organizations went on to win top honors statewide.
PTAs at Oceanside School #5 and Timber Point Elementary School in East Islip were named Nassau and Suffolk county winners, respectively, of Pick a Reading Partner Awards for programs they created to make reading fun and exciting for students. PARP is a New York State PTA program that asks adults to read with children for 15 minutes daily.
Oceanside's program then topped 15 other regional winners last month to take first place statewide. The two-week program, titled "Rocking, Reading & Rapping," strived to show kids that reading can involve formats other than books - such as music and lyrics.
"Music tells a story and kids make their own picture in their heads," said Mary DiGiovanna, the school's PARP co-chair with Frances Cuomo Perpero.
One of Oceanside's highlights was a video titled "What Do You Read?" - a parody of Justin Beiber's 2015 song "What Do You Mean" that featured 20 faculty members who lip-synced the revised words. Their program included visits by 25 guest readers and a day in which students dressed as well-known musical performers, such as Elvis Presley and Taylor Swift.
In total, the Oceanside school's 550-plus students read more than 91,000 minutes during the program last school year. They also were rewarded with a karaoke machine from the school's PTA.
ELMONT
New principals
The Elmont school district has two new principals: Shawnee Warfield at Alden Terrace Elementary School and Amy Buchanan at Dutch Broadway Elementary School.
Buchanan replaced Walter Aksionoff, who retired. She previously served 16 years as principal of Alden Terrace and also had been an assistant principal and kindergarten and sixth-grade teacher at Dutch Broadway. Warfield previously was an assistant principal at Dutch Broadway and the district's Clara H. Carlson Elementary School.
"Alden Terrace has a rich tradition of providing outstanding educational opportunities for all students, and we will continue to deliver academic experiences that are rigorous, engaging and relevant," Warfield said.
"I continue to believe that unity is one of the most important elements of education here in Elmont, and our district does a fine job of moving forward together with one focus: our children," Buchanan said.
LYNBROOK
New West End principal
Cindy Lee is the principal of West End Elementary School.
Lee, who replaced Alison Puliatte, most recently served nine years as principal of Lawrence Primary School at #2 School and before that was assistant principal of Lawrence Middle School.
"I hope to add to the exemplary reputation of West End Elementary by continuing the promotion of a safe, caring, supportive environment and creating additional opportunities for students to be leaders and decision-makers within our school community," Lee said.
ROSLYN
New Harbor Hill principal
Jessica Kemler has been appointed principal of Harbor Hill Elementary School. She replaced Gina Faust, who has become principal of Cantiague Elementary School in Jericho.
Kemler most recently served three years as principal of Babylon Elementary School. She also has been an assistant principal at P.S. 182 in Jamaica, Queens.
"I look forward to ensuring that all students are healthy, happy and safe so they can learn as much as they can," Kemler said. "As a lifelong learner myself, I am currently pursuing my doctorate at St. John's University and look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with my wonderful new community."

LI educators pull 18 of 20 highest pensions statewide: 10 largest payouts go to former superintendents, Newsday analysis shows Nearly two-thirds of 100 top pension earners were from Island's systems

Author: Tyrrell, Joie

Abstract: According to the Teachers' Retirement System, educators' pensions are subject to federal income tax and are exempt from New York State income tax. Some additional actions affect the pensions that more recent and future retirees will see. Since at least the 1990s, the Internal Revenue Code has limited the amount of salary that can be counted in pension calculations for public employees.

Full text:   Eighteen Long Island educators are among the top 20 statewide who have the highest school-employee pensions, and the 10 largest payouts go to former superintendents in Nassau and Suffolk districts - each eligible to receive an annual pension of at least $250,000, a Newsday analysis shows.
A total of 32 out of 50 of the top-earning retirees are educators from Nassau or Suffolk districts, according to New York State Teachers' Retirement System data as of June 30 that Newsday obtained under a Freedom of Information Law request. The data, which excluded New York City public school pensions, covered more than 150,000 retirees statewide with an eligible pension average of $47,000-plus annually.
Newsday's analysis of the 100-highest pension earners showed nearly two-thirds were from Long Island's 124 public school districts. The pension amounts are what the retirees are eligible to receive; they can choose to receive less, meaning their spouses would continue to receive a benefit after they die.
James A. Feltman, who retired in 2010 as superintendent of the Commack school district after nearly 40 years in public education, was first on the list, as he has been in prior years, with an eligible annual pension of $326,214.36.
James Hunderfund, another retired Commack administrator who currently is the Malverne district's superintendent, has the fourth-highest pension statewide, at $317,289 a year. An educator with more than four decades' experience, he retired from Commack in 2006. Hunderfund has been Malverne's schools chief since 2007; his current annual salary is $234,500, district officials confirmed.
Feltman and Hunderfund declined to comment.
The Commack district, in a statement, said, "Both Dr. Hunderfund and Dr. Feltman served as superintendents in Commack. These longtime veteran educators were hired in Tier 1 of the NYS Retirement System, which had more generous allowances for retirement calculations than the later and current tiers. The calculation is made by the comptroller's office, not by the school district. Their retirement benefits are paid from the NYS Retirement Fund, and not by the Commack school district."
Others eligible for the highest pensions had worked in the Half Hollow Hills, Syosset, South Huntington, Comsewogue, Oceanside, Great Neck and Massapequa districts.
According to the Teachers' Retirement System, educators' pensions are subject to federal income tax and are exempt from New York State income tax. Retirees who live outside the state and receive retirement benefits are subject to that state's tax laws, which vary.
All but one of the retirees named in the top 10 enrolled in the retirement system before July 1, 1973, when there were fewer restrictions on the payments that could be used to calculate their pensions. Compared with the rules in place today, these Tier 1 pensions are far more generous.
Lawmakers implemented changes in 1971 that restricted payments used in the calculation of a Tier 1 benefit, eliminating items such as longevity payments and pay for unused leave. Since then, state lawmakers have created five additional "tiers" of pension-plan participants, largely in an effort to control costs. Each new tier has been more restrictive than the tiers that preceded it, in one or more ways, according to the Teachers' Retirement System.
Some additional actions affect the pensions that more recent and future retirees will see.
Since at least the 1990s, the Internal Revenue Code has limited the amount of salary that can be counted in pension calculations for public employees.
Health insurance is not a part of pensions paid by the retirement system, TRS officials said. Any health insurance would be provided by the administrator's or teacher's employer and often is the result of collective bargaining between the school district and the local union.
Another factor in Long Island educators having high pensions is that many districts here pay their top administrators significantly more than districts upstate and in other areas, and this has been the case for years, officials said.
E.J. McMahon, research director at the Albany-based Empire Center for Public Policy, noted that the average pension for career Long Island teachers with 30 or more years of service who retired in 2015 was nearly $87,000. The nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank is fiscally conservative.
"In other words, career Long Island teachers are not only among the highest-paid in the country, they retire with the equivalent of a $1.3 million golden parachute," McMahon said. "A male retiring at age 65 would need $1.34 million to purchase a private annuity plan yielding the same annual income for the rest of his projected life span."
Robert Lowry of the New York State Council of School Superintendents said pensions never again will be as large as Tier 1 payouts and noted that the council has supported actions to limit them. Lowry is deputy director of advocacy, research and communications for the Albany-based group.
Lowry said the organization supported Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's Tier 6 pension reform proposal, enacted in 2012.
"Among other provisions, it limits the amount of salary that can be counted in calculating pension benefits to no more than $179,000 per year , and provides an option for administrators to choose a defined contribution retirement plan," he said.
The Tier 6 reform also increased the share of costs paid by employees from the prior maximum of 3.5 percent of salary to 6 percent of salary for employees earning more than $100,000 per year.
The effects of the Tier 6 retirement benefit will materialize over the long term, Lowry said.
"It will hold down future pensions and significantly reduce costs for school districts," he said.

Massapequa's Kelle Lalier is Newsday's Athlete of the Week

Author: Gavin, Mike

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]05 May 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1786760156?accountid=37869

Abstract: Doesn't matter if Lalier is trying to field a grounder hit to the hole, or line a softball up the middle, or shoot a bull's-eye 10 meters away, she hits her target.

Full text:   Once Kelle Lalier takes aim, she rarely misses her mark.
The Massapequa shortstop has a laserlike focus at the plate that she says has been refined by spending four years on the rifle team.
"In rifle, you are trying to stay completely still," said Lalier, a senior who's a captain on both the softball and rifle teams. "You have to be calm and control your body. It's complete mental focus. So that has really helped me at the plate in softball."
That showed in April during a "What will she do next?!" type of stretch. It began when Lalier, Newsday's Athlete of the Week, went 3-for-4 with a home run in a 9-1 win over Plainview JFK to ignite a streak in which she homered in four straight games.
With Massapequa trailing by a run and down to its final out, Lalier crushed a two-run home run to lift the Chiefs to a 5-4 victory over Calhoun. In the following game, she hit for the cycle, including a grand slam, in a 14-5 win against Oceanside. Next game, after Darby Pandolfo hit a tying home run in the sixth, Lalier hit the go-ahead homer to give Massapequa a 3-2 win over top-ranked and previously unbeaten MacArthur.
"I was very locked in and I wasn't thinking about anything else," she said of her approach at the plate. "It helped having a game every single day. There were no breaks for doubting yourself. You just keep going."
And she has kept going. Lalier is hitting .500 with a .935 slugging percentage and 19 RBIs this season while helping the Chiefs compete for the Conference AA-I title. She has showed tremendous range to her right at short, getting to ground balls that, off the bat, seemed unreachable.
"As much as she has done offensively for us to win games," Massapequa coach Bret Malone said, "she has probably done even more defensively."
Her focus again comes into play in the field as she reads the ball off the bat, analyzes where it might end up, and uses her quick first step to get there in time.
"I've managed to get to a lot of balls that it didn't seem like I'd be able to get to," she said. "I try not to think about anything and just react to the ball."
Doesn't matter if Lalier is trying to field a grounder hit to the hole, or line a softball up the middle, or shoot a bull's-eye 10 meters away, she hits her target.
"She's not just a jack of all trades," Malone said. "She masters a lot of the things she does."

Abstract: After an offseason of strenuous training, Martin capped his high school baseball career with the highest honor in Nassau. First and foremost, he wanted to lead the Sailors to the county title.

Full text:   When Oceanside pitcher Kyle Martin committed to Fordham University as a junior in September 2014, he was not satisfied. A second-straight league MVP nine months later did not quell his desire for more.
He grew up watching his father work long hours as a Long Island Railroad conductor. If Matthew Martin could devote seven days a week to his job to provide for his family, Kyle also could commit his life to the craft he loves: baseball.
"My dad's work ethic is second to none," Kyle Martin said. "Just watching him, he teaches me to go out and get what I want."
After an offseason of strenuous training, Martin capped his high school baseball career with the highest honor in Nassau. In addition to earning a third Conference AA-I MVP, the senior shortstop and pitcher received the Diamond Pitching Award at the county's all-star banquet Wednesday night at the Uniondale Marriott.
"My parents just always try to push me to do my best," Martin said. "They said is the best personal goal I could achieve."
Before his senior season at Oceanside, Martin spoke with his parents about his goals. First and foremost, he wanted to lead the Sailors to the county title. They had fallen in two straight championships, and Martin was so devastated he kept a photograph of MacArthur's 2015 dogpile at the foot of his bed. It haunted him each night before he fell asleep and each morning when he awoke, fueling his will to improve.
To achieve that goal, Martin knew even a two-time league MVP needed to work. He and his parents spoke about the Diamond Awards, given to Nassau County's best pitcher and position player. Winning that award would not only top two league MVPs, it likely would mean Martin did all he could to help Oceanside win a county championship.
"My parents are always about hard work," Martin said. "They're very blue-collar people. It makes me want it more, and they instilled that in me."
The Sailors fell to Massapequa in the county semifinals. Without Martin, they likely would not have advanced so far. The senior struck out 76 and posted a 0.99 ERA in 49 2/3 innings, pitching to a 7-1 record. He hit .340 with six home runs and 22 RBIs in 74 at-bats.
"He's a true five-tool player," Oceanside coach Mike Postilio said. "He can run. He has a cannon. He can field, and he can hit."
Or as Massapequa coach Tom Sheedy phrased it, "What doesn't he do?"
For as long as friends can remember, Martin has turned teammates and opponents alike into admirers.
"He was always a level above everyone else," said Oceanside centerfielder Nick Vlahakis, who has known Martin since elementary school. "We thought we would catch up to him, but that didn't happen."
The difference is likely Martin's work ethic.
Martin increased his workout intensity this offseason. At the end of summer ball, he said he weighed 175 pounds. Then he trained five or six days a week from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. with teammate Mike Pagona at Athletic Movement Protocol in Syosset. During the season, he said he weighed 195 pounds.
"I look forward to seeing how high his ceiling can be," Postilio said, "because he's never going to stop working."

Kid creates charity baseball tournament to help vets

Abstract: [...]I decided to combine the two and create a charity baseball tournament that would help wounded soldiers.

Full text:   This year, on Dec. 10, is my bar mitzvah -- a major milestone in the life of a Jewish boy. I wanted to do a mitzvah project. This means I wanted to do something to help others. But, what would I do?
I knew I wanted to do something with baseball. I have played baseball since age 4, and I have played on travel and national teams, traveling all over the country. I am a catcher. I joined the Patriot Club this past school year in seventh grade at Oceanside Middle School. This club helps raise money and awareness for wounded soldiers. This meant a lot to me, and I felt I wanted to do more to help.
So, I decided to combine the two and create a charity baseball tournament that would help wounded soldiers. With some marketing help from my mom and some advice from my dad, who worked with the military when he was with the U.S. Department of Defense, I decided that the tournament would benefit America's VetDogs. This Smithtown organization provides free, trained service dogs for disabled veterans on Long Island and all across America. My family then took our proposal to Oceanside Little League and the group agreed to host the event with us. "Jeremy Feder's All-Star Charity Baseball Tournament" was born. It will take place in Oceanside from Sept. 16-18, with opening ceremonies on Sept. 16, at 6:30 p.m. at Wrights Field in Oceanside.
This tournament has been growing into a big community event where I live. Kids ages of 8 to 10 will be playing, and they will come from Long Island neighborhoods, as well as parts of New York City to play. We have eight sponsors, local politicians will be there, and students from the Patriot Clubs in Oceanside Middle and High Schools will help sell food and raffle tickets on opening night. They will get community service credits for doing this. Money from all items sold and tournament fees will go to the charity.
I am so excited about this event, and almost can't believe that this has grown into something so big. I can't wait until it is here, and I hope we can raise a lot of money to help soldiers. Maybe this can even become an annual event in my town. Wow.

Abstract: In Merrick, children at Merrick Avenue Middle School filled 10 trash bags with extra Halloween candy for troops overseas as part of a program called Operation Sweet Tooth.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Students across Long Island saluted military veterans through participation in patriotic concerts, flag sales and Halloween candy donations to benefit vets both near and far - all linked to Veterans Day on Nov. 11.
In Bellmore, members of Wellington C. Mepham High School's Class of 2016 filled the school's lawn with the Stars and Stripes and flags of the branches of military service in raising $2,441 for Tuesday's Children, a nonprofit that helps people affected by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The "Flag Field of Honor" held 275 flags that residents purchased in September.
"The overwhelming turnout and the incredible efforts of our school community left me in awe," Mepham Principal Michael Harrington said. The flags will be on display through mid-December.
In Oceanside, students in the Patriot Clubs at the middle school and high school showed their appreciation by raising more than $3,000 through T-shirt sales to benefit the nonprofit Wounded Warrior Project. Club members also purchased and placed small flags around the perimeter of both schools.
In Hicksville, Lee Avenue Elementary School received a visit from Valerie Pfundstein, author of "Veterans: Heroes in our Neighborhood." She read aloud from her children's book and spoke about the importance of understanding the sacrifices veterans have made to protect Americans' freedom.
In Merrick, children at Merrick Avenue Middle School filled 10 trash bags with extra Halloween candy for troops overseas as part of a program called Operation Sweet Tooth. "I thought it would be good to do something nice for the troops who don't get to experience this holiday at home," seventh-grader Jayden Mogelefsky said.
LEVITTOWN
Pond science
Students in the Levittown school district are studying aquatic habitats using a new pond at the district's Levittown Memorial Education Center.
One recent lesson saw seventh-graders at Jonas E. Salk Middle School divide the small pond into grids and measure its varying depths using meter sticks. They also identified the pond's plants, observed water samples using microscopes, and created a "3-D model pond profile," school officials said.
"The purpose of today's lesson was to make students excited about science," said Kevin McDermott, the district's science director. "We also wanted students to see microscopic life you cannot see on the surface."
OLD BROOKVILLE
Head of school
Jesse Dougherty is the new head of school for The Green Vale School, an independent day school for prenursery through eighth grade. He replaced Stephen Watters, who retired after 20 years in the position.
Dougherty most recently served seven years as assistant head of school for international affairs and upper school director at Friends Select School, a college preparatory school in Philadelphia. Before that, he held positions at the University of Pennsylvania, William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia and St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Maryland.
VALLEY STREAM
Political awareness
Students in Valley Stream South High School's participation-in-government classes took a closer look at the world of politics during a visit from Assemb. Brian Curran (R-Lynbrook), held in conjunction with the 2015 election season.
Curran explained his responsibilities, from determining whether he supports or opposes proposed legislation to assessing what will improve his constituents' quality of life. He discussed how laws can affect education and encouraged students to communicate with their elected officials and register to vote.
"I enjoyed having the chance to get a real feel of what it's like to be an assemblyman," senior Shane Camacho said. "We learned how he processes information that he gets from us."

Cops: Brooklyn couple tried to buy $600 in IHOP gift cards using fake credit, debit cards

Abstract: Nassau County District Court Judge Robert E. Pipia set bail for him at $2,000 bond or $1,000 cash.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Two Brooklyn residents are accused of using fraudulent credit and debit cards in an attempt to buy $600 in gift cards at an Oceanside IHOP, authorities said.
Nellie Gonzalez, 32, and Anthony Ross, 30, pleaded not guilty to charges Saturday in Nassau County District Court.
Gonzalez, of 446 Alabama Ave., was charged with 19 counts of second-degree possession of a forged instrument. She was released on $1,500 cash bail, said her Little Neck-based lawyer, Brandon Freycinet.
Ross, of 85 E. 42nd St., was charged with 10 counts of the same crime and was still in custody after the hearing, authorities said.
Nassau County District Court Judge Robert E. Pipia set bail for him at $2,000 bond or $1,000 cash.
Nassau County police said the pair entered the restaurant, at 2971 Long Beach Rd., at 1:44 p.m. Friday and asked to buy six $100 IHOP gift cards.
Gonzalez and Ross allegedly made several attempts to pay for the cards with different credit and debit cards, but each time the purchase was declined.
After the two left the IHOP, the restaurant manager notified police, who found the pair in a car with Virginia license plates in an Island Park parking lot.
Prosecutors had asked for $10,000 bail each for Gonzalez and Ross, but Freycinet told Pipia that Gonzalez had no criminal record; and Gregory Zak, a Nassau County Legal Aid attorney representing Ross, emphasized the nonviolent nature of the allegations.
Police said the pair had used re-encoded credit and debit cards to try to buy the gift cards and had about 80 other blank cards from various financial institutions.
Gonzalez and Ross are scheduled to next appear in county district court in Mineola on Tuesday.

Abstract: Grossman was pronounced dead at South Nassau Communities Hospital about 2:55 p.m. Azzata said police recovered a kitchen knife but still are working to positively identify it as the murder weapon.

Full text:   A 56-year-old lawyer with a "mental illness" fatally stabbed her mother inside her Oceanside home during an argument, officials said yesterday.
Suzan Grossman-Kerner, an attorney from Oceanside, was ordered held without bail yesterday morning during her arraignment at First District Court in Hempstead. She pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder in the Monday stabbing death of her mother, Irma Grossman, 79.
Grossman-Kerner, wearing what appeared to be a hospital gown, spoke only to her lawyer during the court proceeding.
Her lawyer, Todd D. Greenberg, said his client suffers from mental illness. He asked the court for "immediate psychiatric care" for his client, who he said is "very distraught" and a "very decent person, despite what happened here."
"We need a very, very stringent suicide watch on my client," he told the court. "She's been hospitalized before; she's made suicide attempts in the past."
He continued, "One can say, of course, if the allegations are true - that you stabbed your mother - one could imagine there's a serious mental illness involved in this. What is clear is that she does have prior psychiatric history, very serious psychiatric history. And most likely, that psychiatric history will enter into the defense of this action. ... She has a mental illness and we're gonna deal with that within the court system."
Grossman-Kerner's husband, Sherman Kerner, said in a brief interview: "The impact to a family is what anyone would imagine it is: It's a tragedy for my family, my three children. Of course, my mother-in-law was a wonderful woman; my wife, who was a wonderful mother and of course, it's something that stays forever. ... It makes you sad for everybody involved. It's a tragedy for everybody involved."
Kerner, an attorney with a firm in Farmingdale, declined to answer further questions, referring a reporter to his wife's criminal defense attorney.
At a news briefing, Nassau County police homicide squad commanding officer Det. Capt. John Azzata, said that on Monday, "sometime prior to 12:48" p.m., Grossman-Kerner went to her mother's Terrell Avenue home in Oceanside, where the two argued over "her daughter's ongoing medical conditions."
"The daughter, enraged, ultimately stabbed her mother to death," said Azzata, who added there is no record of prior domestic incidents at that address or between the mother and daughter. Grossman was pronounced dead at South Nassau Communities Hospital about 2:55 p.m.
Azzata said police recovered a kitchen knife but still are working to positively identify it as the murder weapon.
Grossman-Kerner called 911 about 12:48 p.m. and told authorities her mother was assaulted. She was arrested at the scene.
Nassau Assistant District Attorney Michael Walsh of the major offense bureau said in court that Grossman-Kerner stabbed her mother "multiple times" in the "head and neck." He said Grossman-Kerner made "statements" to police, but did not elaborate.
Walsh asked for Grossman-Kerner to be remanded and said she "faces the potential of life in prison" if convicted.
Neighbors - some in tears - placed flowers outside Grossman's home yesterday.
"She was a very, very nice woman," said Chyann Kelly, 32. "She was a wonderful person."
Kelly said she knew both women but never had any indication of trouble. "You don't know what goes on in people's houses. All I know is they were very friendly people - the mother, the daughter - they were very nice people. ... It's sad; It's very sad."

5 IN COURT IN OCEANSIDE STABBING: DEFENSE LAWYERS EXPECT NEW EVIDENCE SOON

Author: Murphy, Bridget

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Defense attorneys for some of the Long Beach teenagers facing second-degree gang assault charges after the deadly stabbing of an Oceanside High School senior in September said Tuesday that they expect prosecutors to turn over more evidence in the case soon.
Five of those seven Long Beach teenagers appeared Tuesday in Nassau County Court for a conference for the first time since criminal justice reform measures took effect that give defendants faster access to evidence.
An indictment charges the defendants with the felony gang assault offense in connection with the September attack on Khaseen Morris, 16, who died after prosecutors say another teen stabbed him in the heart during an afterschool brawl at an Oceanside strip mall.
Those who appeared in court Tuesday were: Haakim Mechan, 19; Marquis Stephens Jr., 18; Javonte Neals, 18; Sean Merritt, 18; and Taj Woodruff, 17. All previously put in not-guilty pleas.
Morris' accused killer, Tyler Flach, 19, of Lido Beach, maintains his innocence of charges including second-degree murder and first-degree gang assault. Authorities say he attacked Morris with a knife about 3:45 p.m. on Sept. 16 at the Brower Avenue location. He remains jailed.
Defense attorney William Kephart, who represents Stephens, said after Tuesday's court proceeding that the prosecution told Acting State Supreme Court Justice Howard Sturim during a conference at the judge's bench that more evidence would be turned over "forthwith."
"Pursuant to the new law, the court ordered the DA to provide all evidence in their possession," he added.
Attorney Lawrence Carrà, who represented Neals and Merritt on Tuesday, said the defense expects to get evidence shortly that includes grand jury testimony, witness names and detectives' notes - items that until this year's reforms didn't have to be disclosed until right before a trial.
Attorney David Haber, who Tuesday represented Mechan and Woodruff, confirmed that the defense still was waiting to get additional evidence that included witness statements.
Prosecutors declined to comment Tuesday.
Sturim on Tuesday also offered a third bail option to the teenagers, a partially secured bond, which also is a new requirement under the reform measures.
But each of the five teens already is free from custody after satisfying previously set bonds of $25,000.
Each also faces a misdemeanor assault charge after prosecutors say they intentionally hurt a 17-year-old male who suffered a broken arm and head injury during the brawl. 
Police have said Flach and his friends charged at Morris and his friends before Flach fatally wounded Morris.
The violence broke out after Morris went to the location knowing that the ex-boyfriend of a girl he was friendly with wanted to confront him, according to police.
Morris had texted the ex-boyfriend to say he wasn't dating the girl, but had walked her home from a party, according to Morris' family.
Several of Morris' family members were in court Tuesday and have pledged to fight for justice for their slain relative, the youngest of four siblings. He dreamed of studying photography, had a talent for drawing and writing music and got around on his skateboard, according to loved ones.
Morris' sisters, Keyanna Morris, 30, and Kedeemah Morris, 22, described in an interview after court how they feel tension every time they face the defendants and their families - causing stress as they grieve.
Kedeemah Morris wore a T-shirt that said "Team Khaseen" across the back and on the front had a photo of her brother striking a playful pose. Both sisters seemed on the verge of tears at times as they spoke of missing their late brother.
"Everybody thinks ... the holidays are over. So you'll be fine after the holidays," Keyanna said, before explaining that isn't the case.
"Yesterday was my twin daughters' birthday and we couldn't even get through dinner without them breaking dow

Oceanside stabbing disclosure: Nassau DA turns over grand jury testimony in teen assault case

Author: Murphy, Bridget

Full text: The Nassau District Attorney's Office handed over grand jury testimony Wednesday to lawyers for five of the Long Beach teenagers facing second-degree gang assault charges following an afterschool brawl that turned deadly with the stabbing of an Oceanside High School senior.
The disclosures came as the teenagers appeared in Nassau County Court for a routine conference while the family of slaying victim Khaseen Morris, 16, watched from a row on the other side of the Mineola courtroom.
Acting state Supreme Court Justice Howard Sturim conferred privately at the bench with attorneys involved in the case but didn't go on the record with any public proceedings.
Attorneys for some of the defendants said later that the prosecution handed over CDs with the grand jury testimony of all witnesses except one - a witness whose testimony is the subject of negotiations.
The defendants in court Wednesday were: Haakim Mechan, 19; Sean Merritt, Javonte Neals and Marquis Stephens Jr., all 18, and Taj Woodruff, 17.
An indictment charges the five - and two teens who were 16 at the time - with the felony gang assault offense in connection with the Sept. 16 attack on Morris.
Each also faces a misdemeanor assault charge after prosecutors said they injured a 17-year-old male who suffered a broken arm and head injury in the fight. The teenagers have all pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors say Morris died after Tyler Flach, 19, of Lido Beach, stabbed him in the heart during the fight at an Oceanside strip mall.
Flach, who is due in court Thursday for a conference, has pleaded not guilty to murder, gang assault and weapon charges.
Attorney William Kephart, who represents Stephens, said after court Wednesday that the grand jury testimony handed over was essentially the "meat and potatoes" or the "main pieces of evidence."
"In a case with multiple people, now we can attach details specifically to actions of each individual defendant" as alleged by witnesses, he added.
The prosecution withheld the grand jury testimony of one witness, according to Kephart, who said negotiations are ongoing regarding the disclosure of that evidence.
"The district attorney, at this point, wants to protect one of their witnesses. And at the same time, we want to accomplish discovery," he said. "So this negotiation could achieve both goals."
Attorney Lawrence Carrà, who represents Neals, said it's possible the testimony of the "additional significant witness" could be disclosed under an agreement whereby defense attorneys would have to keep that person's identity confidential after the testimony was handed over.
Carrà also said that it appeared the prosecution was focusing on Flach's case first.
Lawyers for the other defendants declined to comment or left court without commenting.
Prosecutors declined to comment Wednesday.
Authorities have alleged Flach and his friends charged at Morris and his friends before Flach fatally wounded Morris.
The violence broke out after Morris went to the Brower Avenue location knowing the ex-boyfriend of a girl he'd befriended wanted to confront him, according to police.
Morris had texted the ex-boyfriend to say he wasn't dating the girl, but had walked her home from a party, according to the victim's family.
The victim's sister Keyanna Morris, 30, said Wednesday when she heard grand jury testimony had been handed over that it was a "good sign" the case is moving along.
"We know it's going to be a long process until trial," Morris said. "As usual ... we're just going to stick it out and stay strong and continue to show support for

OCEANSIDE: WORKER, FORMER EMPLOYEES SUE TRASH DISTRICT

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An Oceanside Sanitation District worker and two former employees filed a federal lawsuit seeking more than $35 million from the sanitation district and the five commissioners alleging sexual harassment and retaliation for reporting it.
Board secretary Jacqueline Urli and former employees Daniel Faust and Douglas Hernandez filed the suit Friday in U.S. Eastern District Court against the Hempstead Sanitary District No. 7, a special district that provides trash pickup in Oceanside, and the five board members.
Commissioner chairman Austin Graff and the district declined to comment Friday, saying they had not yet been served with the lawsuit.
The lawsuit follows a claim filed against the district last year and a ruling by the state Division of Human Rights in October that found probable cause that the district discriminated against employees who complained Urli was sexually harassed by former Commissioner Matthew Horowitz. Horowitz resigned from the board last month.
The lawsuit seeks "in excess of $5 million" plus attorney fees, for each of the seven complaints including violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 14th Amendment, retaliation, failure to intervene and conspiracy.
"We're seeking to vindicate their civil rights," said Hempstead-based attorney Frederick K. Brewington, who is representing Urli, Faust and Hernandez. "We allege a determination by decision makers that made this a pattern of abuse leveled against those employees who dared to speak up against this behavior."
Urli was the only female employee at the district when she was hired in 2013. She said the sexual harassment began in 2018 when Horowitz began making inappropriate remarks, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit cites incidents, including Horowitz accusing Urli of being unfaithful to her husband, telling co-workers she was having an affair with him, and suggesting "a three-way" with other commissioners.
Urli said she left a board meeting "shaking and crying" when the board was discussing a sexual harassment policy. She said Horowitz had been stroking her arm the week before while installing computer software.
Urli submitted a formal complaint of retaliation, gender discrimination and a hostile work environment in November 2018, chronicling about two months of sexual harassment allegations. The lawsuit states that Graff had circulated an email denying her claims.
The board terminated Faust and Hernandez nine days after Urli submitted her complaint and named them as witnesses. Urli said she was not allowed to attend special meetings until January to take minutes of the sanitation commission. She said she had other duties diminished and was forced to work extra hours under the threat of termination and intimidation.
"There is a level of accountability, not only for these wrongful actions, but to those who failed prevent this behavior," Brewington

OCEANSIDE: RISING FROM THE MARSHES: MARINE NATURE STUDY CENTER SUBMERGED DURING SANDY TO BE REBUILT

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]01 Nov 2019: 23.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Seven years after the Oceanside Marine Nature Study Area was submerged by superstorm Sandy and Tropical Storm Irene, Hempstead officials have unveiled plans to rebuild at the marsh preserve.
The town was awarded a $1.7 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to build a new state-of-the-art 2,600-square-foot education center at the entrance to the 52-acre salt marsh and tidal creeks preserve.
The town was able to repair and reopen the existing educational center on Slice Drive after the storm, but the town now plans to demolish the building to build a new flood-resistant structure with an aquarium, classrooms and a wraparound observation deck overlooking the preserve toward Reynolds Channel.
"it's important to get our children interested at a young age about why they should care about our wildlife and water quality," Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen said. "When we're facing storms and environmental changes we haven't seen in past, this connects us to the impact of a storm."
Construction on the new building is slated for the spring with work expected to last about eight months, town officials said. The town has completed design plans and is now soliciting bids for construction. 
The 50-year-old preserve has reopened since Sandy but without equipment and supplies. The stone educational center was badly damaged, and wooden boardwalks were destroyed and tossed into the marsh.
An analysis by FEMA said the original buildings sustained extensive foundational and steel structural damage and recommended they be demolished and rebuilt.
The town was awaiting money from FEMA for the past several years, behind a long list of other Sandy projects. Town officials replaced wooden boardwalks with more resilient grates that can withstand the tidal surge.
The new building will be elevated with a waterproof perimeter up to 3 feet high, solar powered with a backup generator and equipped with flood doors, vents and a sump pump. It will have accessible ramps, geothermal heating and energy, several fish tank displays and live specimens of marine life.
The preserve was created in the 1960s by the town's former commissioner of Conservation and Waterways, who ordered the marshlands preserved and a freeze on further development. Harold Udell told developers to stop filling the wetlands and dredging in the bay, said Thomas Doheny, commissioner of Conservation and Waterways.
"Otherwise, this would all be homes in the 1960s," Doheny said.
The preserved Marine Nature Study area is home to 250 species of birds, including ospreys, egrets, and other elements of the ecosystem, such as milkweed and shrimp that live in the marshlands.
The site hosts more than 16,500 visitors every year, including 180 classes and regular bird walks by the South Shore Audubon Society.
"The tidal marshes are an important habitat and different ecosystems," Audubon Society member Paul Stessel, 78, of Oceanside said. "The high and low levels are a very important place for birds."

Oceanside's prayer answered: Hail Sailors! On final play, McKee hits Schmitt for TD

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Charlie McKee didn't have much time. Flushed from the pocket and rolling left with the Massapequa defensive line on his tail, Oceanside's 15-year-old sophomore quarterback threw a precision pass off his left foot.
Wisely, wideout Thomas Schmitt had followed McKee's path and found himself in the corner of the end zone, where the ball found him.
The next 30 seconds were something out of a classic sports movie. Schmitt's teammates mobbed him and Oceanside's student section stormed the field before security ushered them back toward the stands.
Schmitt, who was nursing a shoulder injury and was questionable to play, caught the winning 19-yard touchdown as time expired, leading Oceanside to a 34-33 victory over Massapequa in Nassau Conference I football on Saturday.
"I just looked back at [McKee], and he was running for his life, so I was just trying to match him, get to a spot where he could throw it," said Schmitt, who caught 12 passes for 113 yards and two TDs. "He was running to his left, and I just tried to get over there and give him a chance.
"It went right into my hands. What a ball."
McKee completed 35 of 50 passes for 301 yards and five TDs and broke the program's all-time passing yards record in the first quarter. The previous mark of 4,556 yards was set by Tommy Heuer from 2015-17. McKee now has 4,807.
The moment, set up by two straight pass interference calls against Massapequa and an 8-yard reception by Schmitt, capped a comeback from a 33-21 deficit with 5:22 remaining.
Oceanside (6-2) led 21-14 after McKee connected with Nick Platia for a 2-yard TD with just over seven minutes left in the third quarter. But the first six-plus minutes of the fourth quarter belonged to Terence Gallivan of Massapequa (6-2).
He took the period's first play for a 50-yard TD run, tying the score at 21. After a three-and-out by Oceanside, Juan Arango returned a punt 61 yards to the 3-yard line, setting up a 3-yard TD run by Gallivan.
Platia blocked the ensuing PAT, and Massapequa led 27-21.
Oceanside then produced an empty four-minute drive that ended when Dan Meaney sacked McKee for a 5-yard loss on fourth down. Gallivan took the next carry 62 yards for a TD, and Platia again blocked the PAT.
Trailing 33-21, Oceanside marched 59 yards on nine plays. Thomas Flavin took a short pass from McKee up the middle for an 11-yard score. Frank Morizio made it 33-28 after the PAT.
With 2:33 left, Oceanside's onside kick attempt failed when Timothy Morrow fell on the ball to secure possession. Gallivan rushed for a first down on the first play, but the Sailors stuffed the next three runs, capped by Joe Ruggieri's tackle on third down, forcing a Massapequa punt. Ruggieri made 10 tackles.
Oceanside then needed 32 seconds to go 70 yards (aided by the two interference calls) to earn its magical win.
"He just kinda rolled out, I screamed out, 'Schmitty!' and he just kinda threw it up in the air," coach Rob Blount said. "Schmitty's one of our captains, and he wasn't supposed to play this game, but he didn't want to miss senior day."
It was a perfect pass to Schmitt, but one that McKee said required a bit of luck.
"At the beginning of the play, I was looking for [Daniel Mullin] on the over-route," McKee said. "I saw he wasn't there, so I flushed out left. I just saw my two best receivers in [Schmitt} and [Platia], I closed my eyes and I kinda just threw it up, to be honest."
And the moment, as uncertain as it originally seemed for Schmitt, became something he'll always remember.
"I hurt my shoulder two weeks ago against Plainview, and I'm so happy I decided to play," Schmitt said. "Got this brace and I was able to go. This is amazing. I can't find another word to describe it. It's just . . . unbelievable."

DEFENDANTS IN FATAL STABBING APPEAR IN COURT: 5 IN OCEANSIDE CASE PLEAD NOT GUILTY

Full text: Five Long Beach teens charged with second-degree gang assault in connection with the Sept. 16 fatal stabbing of an Oceanside High School student made brief appearances with their attorneys in Nassau County Court on Monday.
Acting state Supreme Court Justice Howard Sturim ordered the five - Haakim Mechan, 19; Marquis Stephens Jr., 18; Javonte Neals, 18; Taj Woodruff, 17; and Sean Merritt, 17 - to return to court Dec. 4. The five each pleaded not guilty to the charges in September. 
Nassau County prosecutors say the five participated in an after-school brawl at an Oceanside strip mall that resulted in the death of 16-year-old Khaseen Morris. Authorities say Tyler Flach, 19, fatally stabbed Morris during the fight. Two 16-year-olds were also charged as the result of the brawl. 
About a dozen of Morris' relatives attended Monday's hearing. 
"It's going to be a long process but we are here," said Keyanna Morris, the victim's sister. "We will be here until the end. We will always fight for Khaseen." 
Authorities have said Khaseen Morris went to the strip mall knowing that the ex-boyfriend of a girl he was friendly with wanted to confront him. Police have alleged that Flach stabbed Morris in the chest after he and his friends charged at Morris and his friends. A 17-year-old boy also suffered a broken arm and head injury in the fight, according to authorities.
Flach, a Nassau Community College student, has been charged with second-degree murder, first-degree gang assault, third-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last week and has been held without bail since his Sept. 18 arrest. He faces up to 25 years to life in prison if convicted of the top ch

OCEANSIDE / COLD SPRING HARBOR: DISTRICTS SEEK $83.2M IN BONDS FOR UPGRADES

Full text: Residents in the Long Island school districts of Oceanside and Cold Spring Harbor will consider bond proposals this month that, if passed, would upgrade and renovate facilities.
In Oceanside, the district is proposing a $50 million bond issue that would provide air conditioning and heat in classrooms. The vote will be Tuesday.
Cold Spring Harbor will hold a $33.2 million bond vote a week later, Nov. 19, that would among other upgrades add a science center at the junior-senior high school. The proposal includes using more than $1.2 million from the capital reserve fund.
In Oceanside, polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. at the School #6 Merle Avenue Gym. School officials said the district will be eligible for reimbursement from the state on 45% of the costs.
District officials project the tax impact for the average Oceanside homeowner to be $11.95 a month over the life of the 15-year bond.
The project will replace existing classroom unit ventilators in all of the district's 10 buildings. It also will include electrical upgrades, ceiling reconstruction work, as well as other related projects.
Superintendent Phyllis Harrington said the district's electrical systems are aging and in need of upgrades. In addition, the proposal would replace window air-conditioning units that are now in some classrooms. This current system does not allow for consistent temperatures in school buildings.
Districts are often required to place window units in classrooms due to the medical needs of students or staff. Harrington said those needs have been increasing. She said the idea for the proposition came from a "groundswell of interest" from parents.
"It started in the community," Harrington said.
If approved, work could begin in the spring of 2021. It will take about five years to complete.
In Cold Spring Harbor, the bond money would create a new science learning center at the district's junior-senior high school building. It also would provide for generators in school buildings, new lighting, expanded parking and classroom renovations, and add security measures. A community forum on the proposal will be held Tuesday at 8 p.m. at the Francis Roberts Community Center on Goose Hill Road.
The bond is tax neutral, officials said, meaning there will be no additional cost if approved. Voters can go to the polls from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. at the Ralph Whitney Field House at the high school-junior high school complex on N

drinks | From home brewing to a craft brewery in Oceanside

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The road to get to South Shore Craft Brewery takes a few turns deep into the Oceanside industrial park near what's known as Oil City. The road to opening the place was even longer and curvier - at least 25 years long for co-founder Nick Cimorelli, who began home brewing as a hobby. "I probably made a lot of Sam Adams clones back in the day," he jokes.
As Cimorelli and his partner, Hugh Howard, watched the craft brewing boom unfold, friends and family did "a lot of pushing," Cimorelli said, until the pair (both high-school engineering teachers by day) took the commercial plunge. They scoured the South Shore for a location, almost landing in Bellmore until they found a former print shop in Oceanside and began a 15-month build out. The L-shaped bar (built by them, of course) has a vibe that could be described as industrial farmhouse; tables are scattered throughout the warehouse-like space, and in one corner is a one-barrel system where they brew a few times per week - that is, until their permanent system arrives, one that's seven times the size.
Designated as a farm brewery, Howard and Cimorelli source 60 percent of their ingredients in-state, including all of their malted grain ("There used to be three malthouses in New York, and now there are 14," noted Howard) and some hops. "Our beers are more traditional, more to style," Cimorelli said, characterizing the lineup, which runs from ginger-lemongrass saison to IPAs to a pale ale dubbed Liquid Perfection. One of the 16 taps pours cider (last week, a sour blueberry cider) and a few other New York-produced libations are on hand, such as mead from WA Meadwerks in Lindenhurst, wine from the Finger Lakes and a vodka distilled upstate that's used for Bloody Maries on Sundays.
The quasi-permanent food truck Schnitz & Gigglez keeps people fed (think bratwurst, pretzels with beer cheese and pizza); until they scale up, Cimorelli and Howard do not yet fill growlers, but plan to eventually - as well as to start canning.

State finds probable cause in Oceanside harassment case

Author: Coburn, Jesse

Full text: New York State has found probable cause to believe that an Oceanside sanitation district discriminated against three employees who alleged a commissioner sexually harassed one of them and the district board fired the others for supporting her. 
The New York State Division of Human Rights released the findings in August and September following investigations into the staffers' complaints against Hempstead Town's Sanitary District No. 7, an independent municipal agency that collects trash in Oceanside, state records show. 
Frederick Brewington, the employees' attorney, said his clients are now preparing to file suit in federal court against the district and its commissioners for alleged violations of federal and state employment and civil rights law. He declined to say what damages or remedies his clients may seek.
Brewington praised the outcome of the state probes.
"What is disturbing about these events is not just the continuing harassment that our clients have had to endure, but the complicity of the other Commissioners, who were aware of the behavior of one of their own, but did nothing to stop it," he said in a statement.
District commissioners did not respond to a request for comment.
In her complaint, Jacqueline Urli, a secretary in the district, said commissioners created a "hostile, toxic" work environment in which sexual harassment went unchecked.
Urli alleged that Commissioner Matthew S. Horowitz, in particular, displayed "revolting, creepy and disturbing" behavior toward her beginning in August 2018, including unwanted touching, suggesting that they "have a three-way" with another district employee and commenting on her appearance, according to the complaint.
The state report on Urli's complaint says the "respondents vehemently deny these allegations."
Urli, who still works for the district, filed a written complaint in November 2018 to Daniel Faust, then the district's general supervisor, who presented the complaint to the board, Faust said earlier this year. 
Around nine days later, the board fired Faust and district treasurer Douglas Hernandez at a public meeting without explanation, Faust and Hernandez said earlier this year. Both had offered to serve as witnesses to Urli's allegations, they said. They each had worked for the district for more than 20 years.

Full text: A 16-year-old high school student fatally stabbed in a fight with other youths over a girl in an Oceanside strip mall lay dying on the sidewalk as dozens of teens recorded the stabbing on their smartphones instead of helping, Nassau police said Tuesday.
The slain boy, identified as Khaseen Morris, was stabbed once in the chest on Monday afternoon in the parking lot of the mall, where students from nearby Oceanside High School congregated before and after school. Morris, who would have turned 17 next month, died just before midnight Monday at South Nassau Communities Hospital, police said.
"Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen," said Nassau Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick, commanding officer of the department's Homicide Squad. "They'd rather video. They videoed his death instead of helping him."
The victim's older sister wept as she recalled watching a social-media video that showed her brother bleeding on the sidewalk.
"He was in so much pain," Keyanna Morris, 30 of Oceanside, said in an interview.
Some 50 to 70 youths were at the strip mall at the time of the stabbing, and many of them, according to police, whipped out their smartphones and recorded Morris being stabbed and bleeding profusely as he lay on the sidewalk. The students later circulated the footage on social media including Snapchat.
Fitzpatrick said police identified the assailants through witness statements and the video, as well as surveillance footage from nearby businesses. Police are looking for six to seven youths believed to have been involved in the melee.
He also issued a striking warning to teens who were involved or at the scene, telling them they should come forward with their version of events.
"The individuals who are responsible for this, if you're not a part and parcel to the murder of Khaseen Morris, now's the time to get in touch with us and let us know who did this and why," said Fitzpatrick. "If you were just coming here and thinking you were fighting, and then he got stabbed during that, you need to be out in front of that. After I put handcuffs on you, that ship has sailed."
Morris, a senior at Oceanside High School who was an avid skateboarder and described by family as artistic and bubbly, had received texts advising him that another youth wanted to fight him over a "perception" that he was dating a girl who may have had a past or current relationship with one assailant. Fitzpatrick said investigators are still trying to determine if, in fact, Morris was dating the girl.
Morris was unarmed at the time of the attack, Fitzpatrick said, but he knew that the ex-boyfriend was looking to confront him.
"Yesterday, apparently there was a prearranged type of dispute going on over a young lady," he said. "That dispute boiled over here, where a group of six to seven males charged at the victim and his couple of friends and, during that melee, stabbed him."
Keyanna Morris said her brother told her he went to a party on Sunday and walked a girl home from there at her request.
Keyanna Morris said the girl's ex-boyfriend sent her brother "threatening messages" in response, echoing what Fitzpatrick said.
"He told me that someone was threatening him," said Keyanna Morris. "But he's like, 'I'm not worried about it. I told him, I don't want anything ... I don't want your girl. It's nothing like that. I just walked her home.' "
Keyanna Morris confirmed the police account that her brother knew the boy wanted to fight him, and said while her brother wasn't looking for a fight, he wasn't going to run away either.
"He knew the one boy wanted to fight him," she said. "Khaseen is like, 'OK, if you beat me up, fine.' "
But, she added, "No one knew he was going to bring a million people out there - and a knife."
The attack also sent a second boy, a 17-year-old who was one of Khaseen Morris' friends, to a hospital with a broken arm and swelling to his head.
Phyllis S. Harrington, superintendent of schools in Oceanside, said Tuesday morning the district has counselors ready to help students and faculty members.
At the strip mall on Tuesday morning, business owners and patrons expressed shock and sadness.
Joel Kim, the owner of Ace Cleaners, said he was in the back working when he heard a commotion and saw the victim bleeding profusely on the ground in front of his storefront. He said he gave water and paper towels to teens who were trying to help. "I did the best I could," he said.
The strip mall, with a variety of businesses including a bagel store, nail salon, Chinese restaurant, hair salon and a pizzeria, is a frequent hangout spot for students from nearby Oceanside High School, business owners said.
Deepak Shah, who has owned Heart To Heart, a stationery and card store in the plaza for 22 years, said he called 911 after the stabbing.
"People are upset," Shah said Tuesday. "All my customers are regulars. Nobody wants to see that happen."

MURDER CHARGE IN TEEN'S STABBING DEATH: LIDO BEACH TEEN HELD IN OCEANSIDE STUDENT'S KILLING

Full text: A Lido Beach teen was arrested Wednesday and charged with second-degree murder in connection with the stabbing death of an Oceanside High School student in an after-school brawl blocks from the school.
Tyler Flach, 18, of Greenway Road, Lido Beach, will be arraigned Thursday morning at First District Court in Hempstead, police said in an evening news release. They would not provide any other detail on how authorities linked Flach to the killing.
Flach was arrested after he surrendered to police accompanied by an attorney, according to a law enforcement source.
The student, Khaseen Morris, 16, died after being stabbed once in the chest Monday during what police said was an after-school fight in a strip mall parking lot following a dispute over a girl.
Morris died of his injuries just before midnight Monday at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside.
The victim's older sister, Keyanna Morris, said she cried "tears of joy" when she got news of the arrest Wednesday. She said her cellphone rang at 5:35 p.m. and a Nassau County police homicide detective was on the other end.
"He said, 'We arrested the person that killed your brother,' " said Morris, 30, of Oceanside. "I broke down crying. Just tears of joy."
Morris said she plans to go to court Thursday when Flach is arraigned. "It's going to be a long fight, but we're going to be there every step of the way," Morris said.
No one answered the door at Flach's home Wednesday evening, and no one picked up the phone. His attorney could not be reached.
Also Wednesday, Nassau police assigned officers to the high school after a threat was made targeting the school, police said.
A police representative confirmed the threat but did not provide details and said investigators believe it was unsubstantiated.
"The Nassau County police department has increased our patrols at Oceanside High School as an abundance of caution and are working with the school's administration to ensure the highest level of safety for students and faculty," Det. Lt. Richard LeBrun said in a statement. "All threats are always taken seriously and are being fully investigated. At this time these threats do not appear credible."
In a written statement to parents, school officials said they had been made aware of posts circulating on social media regarding "neighboring students" coming to the high school. Police had the names of the students who created the posts and were investigating, said the statement, signed by Oceanside Superintendent Phyllis S. Harrington.
On Tuesday, police said dozens of teens recorded the stabbing on their smartphones instead of helping Khaseen Morris. Police said they were able to identify some of the teens responsible through the video, in addition to surveillance footage from neighboring businesses.
Wednesday night, a candlelight vigil was held in memory of the victim at the Oceanside strip mall parking lot where the fatal melee had taken place. More than 300 people attended the vigil -- held over two nights starting Tuesday -- many bringing glass candles that they lit to remember the teen while family members spoke.
Bouquets of flowers, a teddy bear and candles dotted the sidewalk where Morris fell Monday.
Longtime Oceanside High School teacher Frank Nappi said that while Principal Gerri De Carlo has done "an excellent job" in keeping staff informed about the situation, "sadly there exists a palpable unrest" in the school Wednesday.
The current mood in the school was "very somber," he added, and "unlike anything I've experienced in 31 years [as a teacher]."

Full text: The Lido Beach teen charged with fatally stabbing an Oceanside High School student in an after-school attack went looking for the victim before plunging a knife through his heart, prosecutors said in court Thursday.
Tyler Flach, 18, was held without bail after pleading not guilty to a second-degree murder charge in the killing of Khaseen Morris, 16.
Dozens of the victim's family members and friends, some of them weeping, packed a Hempstead courtroom Thursday to watch Flach's arraignment, wearing tie-dyed T-shirts in honor of Morris. The group then left court in silence, accompanied by court officers.
Authorities said Flach attacked Morris, who was unarmed, in a dispute over a girl -- the ex-girlfriend of one of Flach's friends. 
"This defendant and his group of friends went looking for 16-year-old Khaseen Morris ... this defendant attacked Mr. Morris, stabbed him in the chest ... piercing his heart," said Senior Nassau Assistant District Attorney Ania Pulaski, of the Major Offense Bureau, who had asked that the defendant be remanded. 
Hempstead District Court Judge Gary M. Carlton ordered that Flach, who has criminal charges pending in two separate prior arrests this year, remain at the Nassau County jail. 
Flach's defense attorney, Edward Sapone of Garden City, said his client, a student at Nassau Community College and aspiring rapper, "strongly maintains his innocence and he took the responsible step of self-surrendering to eventually clear his name."

Manetta is clutch for Farmingdale: Interception with 31 seconds left seals win over Oceanside

Full text: Rob Manetta was waiting for the perfect moment.
The Farmingdale senior safety played hero Friday night, hauling in the clinching interception in the end zone as the Dalers held on for a 43-36 victory over Oceanside in Nassau I. Manetta said he expected the ball to come his way, so he bided his time, sticking with his receiver and, eventually, making the play with 31 seconds left.
"I knew [Oceanside quarterback Charlie McKee] had to be throwing deep," Manetta said. "He'd been going deep all day and I knew I had to be up in the receiver's face and jump up when I saw the ball."
Manetta's interception came moments after McKee connected with Thomas Schmitt for a 15-yard completion, setting Oceanside (1-1) up at the 26-yard line. Still, Manetta said he wasn't worried, adding that the Dalers' defensive backs were confident they could match up with the Oceanside receivers.
"We knew we could play them," Manetta said. "I was waiting for the receiver's eyes to light up. Once I see that, I know he's looking for the ball, so I can turn around and go for it."
Farmingdale, which trailed 22-9 at halftime, took the lead on Dominic Ciaccio's 84-yard run with 3:01 left. The junior running back finished with three second-half touchdowns and 209 all-purpose yards.
"I had to break it through," Ciaccio said of his final score. "I got a great block from Jordan Smikle and I was focused on the end zone. I looked at the pylon and just went forward."
Both teams battled for control in the second half, but Farmingdale (2-0) used a handful of big-time plays to spark its comeback. Kevin Wilson opened the third quarter with a 91-yard kickoff return and Ciaccio added a 74-yard return later in the frame.
Nick Lundin also tossed a pair of second-half touchdown passes.
And while Oceanside did its best to stymie the rally - the Sailors blocked a pair of second-half extra point attempts and recaptured the lead twice - Farmingdale coach Buddy Krumenacker said he believed the Dalers played their game late.
"We made a few adjustments, but we had to go out and play," Krumenacker said. "We tried to live down by down. I hate to sound so simple, but we kept playing and the game turned our way."

Oceanside students tried to help: The emerging narrative in fatal stabbing unfairly casts all students in a bad light

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the superintendent of the Oceanside school district, I'm compelled to speak out about the disturbing narrative portrayed in the media about an attack that led to the death of one of our students. Oceanside is devastated by Khaseen Morris' death, and our hearts go out to his family and friends. Many of our young people, especially his friends and those who witnessed the brutal attack, are traumatized. 
Contrary to many headlines reporting that bystanders recorded video yet did not help, many of the teenagers present tried to render assistance. A store worker who was interviewed for one story said that some of the teenagers asked him to call 911. It was reported by some outlets that some witnesses asked store owners for paper towels and attempted to stanch  Khaseen's wounds. A teenager reportedly ran to a nearby firehouse for help because 911 was backed up with calls and put him on hold. 
The assertion that no one helped unfairly paints the young people who were there and did help in a horrible light. When Nassau County police held a news conference to announce the first arrest in this case, the department asked for video of the attack. It's not the first time police appealed for that type of evidence. Witnesses who were recording video may very well have been trying to help.
Our administrators and faculty have marshaled district resources to protect and comfort students. We hope to learn more about the details so we can inform our community and hopefully prevent such a tragedy from happening again. For now, we are all reeling. Our instinct as educators is to keep our community's children safe, physically and emotionally. 
We might never have an accurate account of this awful incident because memory is fallible in the face of fast-moving and frightening circumstances. It will take time for the police to interview all witnesses and piece together as much of the story as possible. By that time, media attention may have waned,  but the stain on our young people and this community may remain. As an educator, an advocate for children and a representative of our school community, I will not stand for that. The implication that a rapidly unfolding and terrifying situation that would challenge adults should have been something that groups of teenagers on their way home from school could prevent is not reasonable. It's an unforgiving and damaging presumption. We simply do not know the entire story and should not rush to judgment.
Our students are not perfect. We have many hardworking, kind and responsible young people in Oceanside. As in any community, there are some young people who don't make wise decisions. On the whole, our students raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for charity, organize drives to donate thousands of pounds of food during the holidays, serve as Best Buddies to peers with special needs, and rally around peers and families in times of struggle. Oceanside is a close-knit community where kindness in tough times is the rule rather than the exception.
In the weeks and months ahead, I know that our students will support Khaseen's family and one another. We will find a way as a community to heal from this senseless tragedy and to properly honor the memory of a young person who did not deserve his terrible fate. Khaseen deserves far better than to be the face of an incomplete narrative about his friends and fellow students.

INDICTED IN STABBING: LIDO BEACH TEEN ACCUSED IN OCEANSIDE PUPIL'S KILLING

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A grand jury has indicted a Lido Beach teenager in connection with the stabbing death of an Oceanside High School senior whom authorities say he killed by plunging a knife into the unarmed victim's chest in an after-school fight.
Last week Nassau police arrested Tyler Flach, 18, charging him with second-degree murder in the Sept. 16 slaying of Khaseen Morris, 16. He pleaded not guilty to the charge at an initial District Court arraignment.
But the indictment against Flach remains sealed and the charge or charges he would face at a trial won't become public until his future arraignment in Nassau County Court.
Nassau District Attorney's Office spokesman Brendan Brosh declined to comment after a court conference Tuesday when news of the indictment emerged, citing an ongoing investigation.
One of the victim's sisters heralded the indictment as the "first step" toward finding peace.
"That's so great," Keyanna Morris, 30, said in a phone interview. "Now this can finally move forward and hopefully justice can fully be served."
Morris said her family was busy planning her brother's funeral service and had been expecting to hear about the grand jury's vote. She said she had visited the site of her brother's attack earlier in the day and found candles still burning in his memory.
Morris said her family will be present in court "every step of the way" for the criminal case. 
Attorney Steve Christiansen, who is part of Flach's defense team, said after Tuesday's court conference that Flach, a Nassau Community College student, maintains his innocence. He also criticized the law enforcement investigation of the case.
Police have said the violence broke out after Morris went to a strip mall near his school knowing that the ex-boyfriend of a girl he was friendly with had wanted to confront him.
Morris' family has said he had texted the ex-boyfriend to say he wasn't dating the girl, but simply had walked her home from a party. But Morris knew the girl's ex-boyfriend thought he was dating the girl, according to police.
Police have said Flach and his friends - a group of six or seven in all - sought out Morris and charged at him and "his couple of friends" before Flach stabbed him once during that melee.
Police also have said that dozens of students witnessed the brawl, with some recording video and posting it on social media, but few helped Morris as he was bleeding on the ground.
Police got the first of seven 911 calls at 3:46 p.m., according to Nassau Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder. They responded within two minutes, but Morris died hours later while hospitalized, authorities said.
Police have urged anyone who was a witness or has video evidence to contact them, saying others may face criminal charges. Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the homicide squad's commander, also issued a public warning last week to teens who were involved or at the scene, telling them they should come forward with their version of events.
But Christiansen, the defense lawyer, said after Tuesday's court conference that law enforcement officials had "leveled an ultimatum basically at all of the young people there present at the parking lot at the time of this incident."

Oceanside hospital rebranded: Name change reflects affiliation with Mount Sinai

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Oceanside-based South Nassau Communities Hospital is officially changing its name to Mount Sinai South Nassau. 
The 90-year-old, 455-bed community hospital's name was changed to better reflect its affiliation with Manhattan-based Mount Sinai Health System, which it officially joined in October 2018. South Nassau originally agreed to join Mount Sinai a year earlier.
"This new name reflects our new partnership with Mount Sinai while recognizing the long history of South Nassau and its ties to the South Shore communities we have served for more than 90 years," said Richard J. Murphy, president and CEO of Mount Sinai South Nassau. "Our patients will now also have access to highly specialized physicians, clinical trials, and a wide range of new services as we grow the partnership with Mount Sinai."
Dr. Arthur Klein, president of the Mount Sinai Health Network, said the health system plans to make "signficant capital expenditures" to expand the hospital's capabilities.
He said the investment would help South Nassau expand its outpatient, emergency department and intensive care units.
"It is our intention to make this a true flagship hospital on Long Island for Mount Sinai, Klein said. 
As part of the partnership agreement, Mount Sinai Health System has committed $120 million toward South Nassau's expansion plans.
Mount Sinai South Nassau is in the midst of a $400 million long-term strategic growth initiative. In the next three years, the hospital plans to begin work on a four-story addition,  a three-story parking garage, and a new central utility plant and electrical emergency facility on the hospital's main campus in Oceanside, as well as a $40 million Medical Arts Pavilion at its Long Beach location.
Also, Mount Sinai South Nassau said its doctors have been collaborating with Mount Sinai professionals in key service areas, including maternal fetal medicine, interventional endoscopy and pediatric cardiology. South Nassau also plans to expand its cardiac surgery, cancer care, neuroscience, and colon and rectal surgery programs.
The Mount Sinai Health System includes more than 400 ambulatory, or outpatient, practices and other community locations, and more than 7,000 primary and specialty care physicians, as well as 200 physicians and other experts at 11 multidisciplinary practices based on Long Island.

A LAST RIDE TO HONOR KHASEEN: FRIENDS, FAMILY GATHER TO REMEMBER OCEANSIDE YOUTH WHO WAS STABBED

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dozens of teenagers slowly rode out of an Oceanside funeral home Sunday under clear and sunny skies in remembrance of Khaseen Morris, the 16-year-old who was fatally stabbed nearly two weeks ago in an after-school fight.
Sunday's half-mile ride began at the Towers Funeral Home where hundreds had mourned Morris' death at his funeral a day earlier. It ended at the strip mall parking lot on Brower Avenue where he was stabbed.
The last ride with Khaseen, his family said, was an occasion to celebrate his life and to lift up the teens who were left traumatized after witnessing the event.
"I just want them to understand that this can still be a happy place. This can still be a happy town," said Morris' eldest sister, Keyanna Morris, 30. "We're gonna end this off with bringing joy to where it happened."
Tyler Flach, 18, of Lido Beach, who police said plunged a knife into Morris and pierced his heart on Sept. 16 in a fight at the parking lot, has been indicted by a grand jury with a murder charge and a weapon offense. Seven more teens, all of Long Beach, were arraigned Saturday, facing assault charges in connection with the fight that killed Morris and injured a 17-year-old male.
Escorted by police cars Sunday afternoon, Morris' sister Kedeemah Morris, 22, led the long line of friends and family members on skateboards, bikes, scooters and foot.
Music boomed from a portable speaker carried by Nelson Robles, 17, who played Morris' favorite songs.
Robles of Freeport, one of Morris' best friends, described him as someone who was energetic, present and mature.
"He was the person I went to frequently when something happened randomly, and I'm like, 'Yo, I need to tell you what just happened,' " Robles said. "When I was in trouble, he's the one I went to 'cause he could give guidance and he was wise beyond his years."
Trentin Chalmers, another one of Morris' best friends from Freeport, wore the same T-shirt Morris wore on the day he died. The blue shirt depicted an alien hugging its knees with a thought bubble that says, "I don't belong here..."
"Knowing that this was his style and what he'd like to wear, it gives me strength," the 17-year-old said before the ride.
In the past two weeks, Chalmers said he had been asked to describe one memorable instance he shared with Morris, with whom he spent time almost every day. But the moments he missed the most, he said, were the times they spent doing nothing.
"I feel like the most memorable parts of his experience with me were the times where we didn't do much," he said. "He was my sense of security, like my second home. We literally have each other's back, and we could talk for hours about anything. The conversation would never stop."
As the ride was about to begin, Chalmers danced to the beats of the music at the front of the crowd before they headed toward the strip mall. Near him was Khaleem Morris, who skated on his brother Khaseen's skateboard Sunday.
"I felt peaceful," the 19-year-old said of the 15-minute ride. "It's very calming because it was something he liked to do."

'TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER': HUNDREDS ATTEND WAKE FOR SEPT. 11 ADVOCATE LUIS ALVAREZ IN OCEANSIDE

Author: O'Keeffe, Michael

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]03 July 2019: 8.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Until his life ended, former NYPD officer and 9/11 victims advocate  Luis Alvarez reminded a nation vowing to "never forget" that first responders still battle diseases linked to the terrorist attacks, relatives and colleagues said Tuesday at his wake inside an Oceanside funeral home.
Alvarez would have been uncomfortable with all the attention his death Saturday received, said his older brother, Phillip Alvarez, a retired Suffolk police detective and among hundreds of mourners at Towers Funeral Home for the service.   
Luis Alvarez, though reticent, assumed the spotlight to push Congress into action to aid the cops, firefighters and others who, like him, developed life-threatening diseases from searching the toxic rubble of the World Trade Center for survivors and those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"His message was really simple," Phillip  Alvarez said of his younger brother. "Take care of each other and take care of yourselves."
A former NYPD bomb squad detective, Luis Alvarez, 53, died Saturday in a Rockville Centre hospice from complications of colorectal cancer first diagnosed in 2016.
He was a Cuban immigrant who loved to cook for his wife and three sons, friends and family said. Nephew Michael Alvarez described his uncle as a "regular guy" who slipped him his first sip of beer and liked to tell off-color jokes. 
He was also someone not afraid to speak up to right a wrong, his son David Alvarez said, and felt honored to do the often-grueling work at Ground Zero.
"My father would want to be remembered as a man who tried his best to raise his voice the right way," David Alvarez said. "He wanted to be remembered - like so many other first responders - as someone who rushed in without hesitation and would do it again in a heartbeat."
Luis Alvarez, who spent six years in the Marine Corps before joining the NYPD, appeared with former "Daily Show" host and activist Jon Stewart on June 11 in front of a House Judiciary subcommittee. He joined Stewart in pleas with lawmakers to replenish the September 11th Victim  Compensation Fund, which provides benefits to first responders and volunteers struggling with health problems linked to toxic chemicals at Ground Zero. Thousands of first responders and volunteers have developed diseases linked to the toxins at the site or are at risk of becoming sick.
"I will not stand by and watch as my friends with cancer from 9/11 like me are valued less than anyone else because when they get sick, they die," a gaunt Alvarez, his voice weak, told lawmakers during his testimony. 
The $7 billion September 11th Victim Compensation Fund has been drained, with benefit payments slashed by up to 70 percent. Legislation pending before Congress would ensure the fund can pay benefits for 70 years.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) expressed concerns about the cost of the fund, and Stewart and 9/11 victim advocates accused Congress of dithering as first responders suffered. A bill to replenish the fund passed the full committee unanimously and McConnell - after blistering criticism from Stewart - said he will allow an August Senate vote on the bill. 
"We hope and pray that the Congress and the Senate heard his message and that he will have died a happy man for his efforts for the World Trade Center fund, the victims compensation fund," Phillip Alvarez said. "I can guarantee you if we need to go down there again, I will go down there again ... I will keep going until his message and his bill is passed."
Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived early to the funeral home, before hundreds stood in line to get in. He offered the Alvarez family condolences but did not speak to reporters. De Blasio said Monday he would award Alvarez a posthumous key to the city "as a symbol or our profound respect and gratitude." 
Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone attended the wake and described Alvarez as an inspiring figure.
"He didn't stop fighting until the very end," Bellone said. "He is a vivid example of courage and honor." 
Alvarez's funeral is expected to begin at 10 a.m. Wednesday at Immaculate Conception Church in Astoria, Queens. 
His family has asked that donations be made in his name to charities such as Manhattan's St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, KiDS NEED MoRE  in Amityville, and the Nesconset-based FealGood Foundation, which provides assistance to injured first responders, family attorney Matt McCauley said. 
Phillip Alvarez expressed appreciation to those in the news media who amplified his brother's efforts.
"Thank you very much for giving him the runway and the avenue to get his message out for him and

Full text: We are Cub Scouts from Troop 230 and have been in our troop for about four years. We have had so many good times with our troop, from fun Nerf battles to our special Halloween camping trip.
One of our most memorable times came when we had our Arrow of Light Ceremony in January. This is the highest honor given in the Cub Scouts. To get this award you have to help in building a better world, be an outdoorsman, show duty to God in action and take part in a scouting adventure. Besides that, there are electives that we have to fulfill.
The symbol is an arrow with seven rays of sun, which stand for the seven days of the week above it. This symbolizes that every day is a new day and a day to live by the Scout law and do a good deed. The arrow is pointing right to symbolize that nothing should be left undone.
This was our most honorable achievement as Cub Scouts. We are now looking forward to being Boy Scouts.

Wayne French Kitchen review: A risk-averse bistro opens in Oceanside

Full text: Wayne French Kitchen
2757 Long Beach Rd., Oceanside
516-806-2188, waynefrenchkitchen.com
COST
$$-$$$
SERVICE Friendly, attentive
AMBIENCE Bistro, new and abridged
ESSENTIALS Open for lunch, Monday to Friday noon to 4 p.m.; dinner Sunday to Thursday 5 to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday noon to 11 p.m.; brunch, Saturday and Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; major credit cards accepted; weekend reservations suggested; wheelchair accessible
The music drifting through Wayne French Kitchen couples "La Vie en Rose" and "My Way."
So does the food.
Oceanside's foray into France is a warm, introductory tour, with seven or eight dishes that you've either tasted or heard about.
It's a bistro-style spot, upbeat and easy to follow - as in that high school French class where you learned to say "Good morning, Jean, how are you?" or "Where's the library?"
Given that French cuisine generally has been welcomed on Long Island slightly better than the Russian winter greeted Napoleon's Grand Armee, the new addition understandably stays risk-averse.
But you'll also banish any reverie of crisp-crust baguettes and long-churned, ultrarich butter as well as reflections from distressed mirrors and shelves with bottles of Ricard.
No wide-plank, weathered floors, either. Still, the woodwork is polished and dark and the chairs have the right rattan look. Besides, the TVs are tuned to sports, sometimes soccer.
Suitably disarmed, march on and begin with chef Wen Chen's enriched version of frisee aux lardons, the bright salad with lettuce similar to endive and often called chicory, entangling nuggets of bacon, topped with a poached egg, and here, to liven things up, a scattering of Maytag blue cheese.
It's much better than the tired roasted beet salad, where the blandness is cut only by toast slathered with goat cheese. Onion soup gratinee arrives thin and pale rather than deeply hued and bracing. Even the cheese is forgettable.
Braised oysters with leeks and creme fraiche turn chewy and are overwhelmed by their modest sauce. The larger disappointment: escargots, out of the shell and rubbery, set in a soupy plate of white beans, all with an unpleasantly acidic aftertaste. You'll be dreaming about dimpled plates and garlic-parsley butter.
The openers improve dramatically with a meaty crabcake that's boosted by capers and saffron mayonnaise; and the opulent, seared foie gras, flanked by half of a sweetly poached peach and brioche toasts.
It's a very satisfying prelude to filet mignon au poivre, a velvety affair with just enough pepperiness and cream, even though the rendition of dauphinoise, or scalloped, potatoes is pretty restrained. The strip steak frites, fibrous and juicy, benefits from the company of crisp fries.
The kitchen continues its travelogue with the rosy, juicy roasted duck breast and confit of duck leg. The roasted chicken also stands out, flanked by fingerling potatoes and spinach finished with garlic.
Croque monsieur, the classic, browned ham-and-cheese sandwich, heads the more casual alternatives, followed by a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and Sriracha-sparked mayonnaise. You can order a bacon cheeseburger, too, and add avocado to it.
A special of whole, pan-roasted orata, with tangy red pepper sauce, couscous, dates and slivered almonds, tastefully brings in hints of the Mediterranean and North Africa. Grilled tuna with red-pepper vinaigrette and grilled Scottish salmon with lemon-truffle vinaigrette provide the safety-first competition.
Wayne continues to expand the map, raising a different tricolor, with the inevitable concession to pasta. But at least it's well-done rigatoni with spicy sausage in a tomato-cream sauce. The spinach-and-cheese ravioli, served with wild mushrooms, are a serviceable Italian detour, too. The Italianate theme also takes in scallop-and-shrimp risotto, with asparagus.
The apropos dessert is a generous, warm apple crumble, topped with vanilla ice cream. You can try a blueberry crumble the same way. Or give in to creme brulee. Skip the mushy cranberry bread pudding.
By now, you might enjoy an after-dinner drink, while the soundtrack segues effortlessly from "Non, Je ne Regrette Rien" to "The Impossible Dream."

Full text: Martin Luther's
faulty judgment
Within the context of the July 9 article "German Jubilee" , Newsday rightly refers to Martin Luther's anti-Semitism. It's mortifying when a family member embarrasses the family. Worse is when the family member embarrasses the denomination he founded. One of Luther's signature insights is that humans are both sinner and saint, and he qualifies as both.
We can't change the past, in which the medieval thinking of a great mind went thoroughly astray, and was used centuries later to justify heinous crimes against the Jews. We have the future before us: one of justice and reconciliation. Perhaps in this year, which marks the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation, Christians and Jews can come together and reaffirm once again our commitment to mutual love and respect.
Nancy Rakoczy,Oceanside

Health coverage and
McCain's illness
I wish Sen. John McCain well, and I hope he is able to recover fully from his illness .
But I also hope that his colleagues in the Senate and the House use this as a learning opportunity and consider the consequences of allowing pre-existing conditions to be cause for denial of payment for treatment of serious illnesses.
McCain was previously diagnosed with melanoma, which can metastasize to the brain causing glioblastoma. McCain's doctors say the cancers are unconnected in his case. However, because of his prior diagnosis, if he had the type of insurance that Republican bills would allow, he could be denied payment for his treatment. Even someone as wealthy as he could go bankrupt.
Fortunately for the senator, his insurance will apparently cover the cost of his treatment. Shouldn't the rest of us have the same reassurance?
Leonard Cohen,Wantagh
Russian 'collusion'
grabs attention
I'm starting to believe what candidate Donald Trump said about shooting someone on the street and still winning the election. The fiasco that we're witnessing is unparalleled in political history: a sitting president unabashedly defending his son's behavior that is clearly against the law .
As a casual observer, what's most striking to me is the array of contradictions by Donald Trump Jr., former campaign director Paul Manafort, and possibly the president himself, about alleged Russian collusion. We all remember Trump Jr. being indignant that the media would even suggest that someone in the campaign would talk to the Russians, and this was after his June 2016 meeting with Russians. He called the Democrats liars for advancing such a scenario.
A few days after Trump Jr. was invited to meet with Russians, his father promised a "major speech" with sensational news about Hillary Clinton.
I hope the investigations will unveil what he was referring to.
Frank Geffrard, Central Islip
-
For some reason, the media is outraged that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer for 20 or 30 minutes.
Former President Bill Clinton received half a million dollars for a speech to Russian bankers? Oh, nothing to see here.
Michael Quane, South Hempstead
Remain skeptical
about third track
Having read the breathless, triumphalist editorials in Newsday on the approval of the Long Island Rail Road's third-track project from Floral Park to Hicksville, I would respectfully warn you to recover your missing journalistic skepticism .
Newsday's credibility now rests on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority completing the project in three to four years, on a budget of $1.9 billion. Knowing that East Side Access is billions of dollars over budget, and the ever-further-delayed completion date is, so far, 13 years behind, caution at MTA claims is not only prudent, it is essential.
Would Newsday's editors care to wager on the MTA's ability to bring in the third track on time and on budget?
I'm afraid that Newsday's advocacy represents the triumph of wishful thinking over experience.

Secret Santas donate holiday gifts to seniors: Presents set for needy living in nursing homes, homebound or isolated

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Angie Villalba recalled how as a kid growing up in a financially struggling family in Brooklyn she was overjoyed to receive gifts on Christmas from anonymous donors.
So when the Valley Stream woman on Saturday saw a "Senior Secret Santa Drive" display at the Roosevelt Field mall, meant to provide holiday gifts for needy seniors, she added a 97-year-old veteran to her shopping list.
"It's always nice to receive something from someone you don't know," said Villalba, 40.
The daylong gift drive at the Garden City mall was an effort by several Nassau County Presbyterian churches "to bring some type of joy" to seniors who are homebound, in nursing homes without family nearby or otherwise isolated, said Akua Agyeman, a deacon at First Presbyterian Church in Oceanside who helped organize the first-time event.
"As joyous as the holiday season can be, for a lot of older adults, it can be depressing if they don't have family around," Agyeman said.
The drive also benefited caregivers of seniors who are struggling to make ends meet.
Passersby picked up cards with a list of suggested gift items, such as blankets, coats, undergarments, towels and pajamas.
"There's a need for basic things that we take for granted," Agyeman said.
Some donors wanted to personalize their giving and chose a paper "ornament" from a small Christmas tree that included a short description of the person in need and, in some cases, a request for a specific gift.
They included "S.H.," described as an "82-year-old woman - No visitors at nursing home," "E.G.," who is "in need of thermals and T-shirts," and "A.K.," who was "still not back in my home since [superstorm] Sandy. Would love new bedding or any item ... since all my things are gone."
Villalba chose the ornament that described a "grandpa" and veteran who asked for wool socks and gloves.
"I thought that as a veteran, he shouldn't be cold," Villalba said. "We should always take care of our veterans."
Local churches and nonprofits identified about 200 seniors for the program, and names are still coming in, Agyeman said.  
"In our culture, many older folks are forgotten," said Elsie Ginsberg, 35, of Port Washington, before she began shopping for a senior. "It's important to remember them."
Organizers also accepted cash donations. Cynthia Hemley, , wrote out a gift tag to "T.J." and put money in a small cardboard box, signing it "A friend."
"T.J." is a single mom raising three kids and caring for a mother with dementia, and that "really spoke to me," Hemley said.
Hemley was buying Christmas and Hanukkah presents when she stopped to donate. She said she wanted to help someone "who is managing a lot."
"My family is very fortunate," Hemley said. "We absolutely have what we need. What we have on our [holiday] list is things we want."

Classic rides on display for a good cause

Full text: Among the eye-catching muscle cars at a fundraiser for homeless veterans on Sunday in Holbrook, Tom DeMaria's 1969 AMC Hurst SC/Rambler stood out. The sedan's red-white-and-blue factory paint job glistened in the sun.  An attached sign noted its original parts and 20,000 miles logged over five decades.
"It just turned 50 years old," said DeMaria, 77, of Oceanside, who, along with his younger brother Phil, is the original owner, having purchased the coupe in 1969 for $3,300. "Once in a while I ride it around the block. I think I put six miles on it this year."
DeMaria's babied SC/Rambler - one of just 1,512 made by the long-shuttered American Motors Corp. - was among the many classic cars and motorcycles on display at  Sunday's seventh annual Kick Stands Up Motorcycle Poker Run and Car Show for Homeless Veteransk.
The event was expected to raise between $15,000 and $20,000, organizers said, with proceeds going to Suffolk County United Veterans, a Ronkonkoma-based nonprofit.
"It helps to fill a lot of the holes of government funding," said Michael Stoltz, the organization's chief executive officer, adding that the agency aids up to 800 veterans a year.
 In addition to the classic car show and vendors,the day featured the "poker run," motorcyclists embarking on a 50-mile ride, collecting playing cards at various stops in hopes of gaining a winning hand.
Many participants were veterans looking to pay forward the goodwill they had received from Stoltz's organization.
Gregory Dutcher, 63, who served in the Army from 1974 to 1993, said he resigned from his job in 2005  with complications from a heart condition and faced financial hardship. He turned to the Suffolk veterans group, which placed him in its Yaphank housing facility. Dutcher, who then spent years volunteering for the organization, said he founded his own exterminating company later.
"I lost everything. I had nowhere to go," said Dutcher, who showed off his black 2012 Chevrolet Camaro in the car show. "I just went there and asked them if they could help."
The veterans organization also administers the Joseph P. Dwyer Veterans Peer Support Project, which provides group and one-on-one counseling to veterans. Frank DiDomenico, 46, of Patchogue, who served in the Air Force as well as the Army and Air national guards from 1992 until 2016, sought help from the initiative and then became a counselor.
"We definitely feel more comfortable being around other veterans," he said. "My job is to be a listening ear and at the same, if I feel they need more help than I can give, I can direct them to the Suffolk County

Schwirzbin and lots of hits: Port Washington coasts, reaches Nassau 'AA' finals

Author: Rubin, Roger

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]28 May 2019: 39.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2230547519?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Port Washington sophomore Christian Schwirzbin has the catchy nickname "Iceman." No one is sure if it started with him making important free throws in pickup basketball games some time ago or if it's about him chomping ice cubes on the Vikings' bench.
Either way, it was fitting Monday as he was stone-cold impressive in pitching his team past Oceanside and into the Nassau Class AA championship series.
Schwirzbin, usually a lefty reliever, was asked at Sunday's practice to fill the role of the injured Derek Livingston and make his first start of the season. He allowed one run over five innings in what became a complete game as host Port Washington rolled to a run-rule, 11-1 win in the deciding Game 3 of the semifinal series.
Port Washington (21-4) also scored an 11-1 run-rule victory in Game 1.
"I look at this team coming together this year as a sort of perfect storm," Port Washington coach Matt Holzer said. "They combine a lot of talent with a tremendous work ethic and a sort of belief in each other. They're playing really well."
Alex Chang echoed his coach.
"Each of us is making a contribution to the greater good of the team," Chang said. "What's happening with us is what you see when everyone buys in."
The Vikings will make their first appearance in a county championship since 1969 when they meet defending state champion Massapequa (19-4) in Game 1 on Friday at SUNY Old Westbury. Port Washington will be seeking its first title, according to Newsday records that date to 1945.
The Vikings allowed only 21 runs in their last 15 games and won 11 of their last 12.
There is something apropos about Schwirzbin being drafted for the assignment and then delivering. Port Washington has been a true ensemble this season, getting contributions from all over the roster. Case in point: Six Vikings drove in runs against the Sailors (18-9).
"When they told me on Sunday that I'd be starting, I was excited," Schwirzbin said. "I know the way our lineup consistently produces, so I was confident and didn't put too much pressure on myself."
He gave up five hits, a walk and a hit batsman and struck out three. Livingston, who suffered a sprained ankle in Port Washington's final regular-season series, could return to start against the Chiefs over the weekend.
The Vikings scored four in the first, with Adam Jackman striking the big blow, a two-run double. In the three-run second, Chang hit a two-run homer over the high fence in right-center. Sean Meth had a two-run double to key a three-run fourth.
In the fifth, Port Washington tried to wrap it up early by inserting speedster Nick Esposito as a pinch runner at second base with two out. Jackson Sattinger singled to center and Esposito slid home safely on a bang-bang play to end the game.
"We get contributions from everywhere," Meth said. "[Schwirzbin] did a heck of a job for making his first start ever. It shows you something."

Long Island romps: Campisi is MVP as LI stars beat elite from NYC

Author: DeJohn, Kenny

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 June 2019: 26.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Greg Campisi was the first-team quarterback in Friday night's Empire Challenge at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium, all thanks to a game of rock, paper, scissors with fellow quarterback Matt Sluka.
Leaving the decision to a game of chance proved to not be much of a gamble. Campisi, the dynamic signal-caller for St. Anthony's, earned game MVP honors by going 9-for-15 passing with two touchdowns and rushing seven times for 63 yards as the exceptional seniors from Long Island defeated their New York City counterparts, 44-20, in a blowout by halftime.
"It was one of the best two weeks I've ever been involved with in football," said Friars coach Rich Reichert, coaching in the final game of his career after 41 seasons in football. "These kids, they did everything right. They showed up for practice, they were respectful and then they finished the deal."
By the end of the first half, it was hardly a question of whether or not Long Island would win. It was a matter of by how much.
Long Island's offense rolled, tallying 325 yards and scoring 30 points against the New York City defense. The game, in its 24th season, benefits the Boomer Esiason Foundation and cystic fibrosis research.
"I was not expecting a blowout because last year they were toe to toe," said Campisi, who credited the offensive line. "It's nice. We came out really hot. We wanted to rep Long Island to its fullest."
Long Island set the tone by scoring on each of its five first-half drives. Starting from its own 29-yard line to open the game, Long Island went 71 yards on 13 plays, scoring when Campisi found Nick Giacalone (Carey) from 3 yards. Anthony Pecorella's extra point made it 7-0.
The defense, which held New York City to 122 yards on 24 plays in the first half, quickly got the ball back to the offense. The second drive, quarterbacked by Sluka (6-for-12 passing for 95 yards and one TD), was even better than the first.
Colin Hart, Garden City's quarterback-turned-receiver for the game, took a reverse handoff and delivered a 22-yard pass to Jordan Alexander (Lawrence) on the drive's penultimate play. Hall then ran it in from 15 yards for a 14-0 lead.
Hart later connected with Jake Lazzaro (Oceanside) for 38 yards on another trick pass, setting up Lazzaro's 20-yard TD catch on a fade from Sluka that put Long Island ahead 27-6.
Kevon Hall (Roosevelt) rushed eight times for 68 yards and two TDs, including a 12-yard run for a 37-6 lead.
"This is an unbelievable experience," he said. "I'm going to remember this for the rest of my life."
The offense accrued 450 yards on 63 plays, but the defense was just as impactful.
Marco Musso (Massapequa) had six tackles (three for a loss) and set up a 35-yard field goal by Anthony Pecorella (Chaminade) at the end of the first half after his sack forced a turnover on downs.
"We're a collective unit," Musso said. "If the offense scores, we have to hit them back with the defense."
The hits just kept on coming.

1 to 3 years for 'granny scammer'

Author: Murphy, Bridget

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]29 June 2019: 11.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A "granny scammer" who stole $45,000 from an Oceanside octogenarian by pretending her son needed bail money after an arrest now will pay a price of his own, according to Nassau prosecutors.
A judge on Thursday sentenced Frederik Regalado, 23, of the Bronx, to 1 to 3 years in prison, the Nassau District Attorney's Office said Friday.
Prosecutors said the defendant pleaded guilty in May to three grand larceny counts.
The elderly victim handed over the money in three bundles on Dec. 3, 2018, after getting three phone calls, according to prosecutors.
In the first, a caller told the 81-year-old she needed to provide $7,500 in bail money for her son because he'd been in a Manhattan car crash and arrested for drunken driving, prosecutors said.
They added that Regalado, while pretending to be a courier, came to the victim's home and collected the cash early that afternoon.
Around two hours later, someone called the victim and said a judge had raised the bail amount because the woman whom her son hit in the crash had been pregnant and lost her fetus, according to prosecutors.
They said Regalado then returned to the victim's home and collected another $7,500.
About two hours after that, a caller told the victim she also had to provide $30,000 for medical bills related to the crash, according to prosecutors.
The defendant then visited the victim's house a third time and took that money, the district attorney's office said.
But minutes later, the victim's son called and she realized he wasn't in jail, according to authorities, who said a judge on Thursday also ordered Regalado to pay the money back.
The victim's electronic doorbell camera recorded video of the defendant taking money from her, smiling and giving her a thumbs-up. Authorities later released that video while asking for the public's help identifying the culprit.
Tips flooded in that helped authorities to identify Regalado before they arrested him on Dec. 18 in Massachusetts.
Defense attorney Michael DerGarabedian said Friday that he represented Regalado and his client was only "a middleman" in the scam and not the caller who repeatedly contacted the victim.
"He only made about $600 and he wasn't the ringleader. ... He just drove there and got the money and gave it to someone else. The real thieves are still on the run," DerGarabedian said.
Nassau police said after Regalado's arrest that he was under investigation for a potential role in three other cases where victims lost nearly $65,000, and also was charged in a Lake Success scam.
A spokeswoman for Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said Friday that all of those cases still are under investigation.
Singas said in a statement that Regalado "deserves every day in prison that he was sentenced to," and urged people to be wary of "so-called granny scammers" who "prey on vulnerable seniors."
The district attorney added that any scam victims can contact her office at 516-571-7755.

'REVENGE PORN' BILL APPROVED: 19-0 BIPARTISAN NASSAU VOTE; JAIL, FINES IN THE OFFING

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nassau legislators on Monday unanimously passed a bill to make posting of intimate sexual images of partners without consent a crime punishable with jail time and fines.
The bill, which also would give victims the ability to pursue civil cases, outlaws the practice known as "revenge porn" and is expected to be signed into law next week by County Executive Laura Curran, a Democrat.
All 19 members of the Republican-controlled legislature voted for the bill sponsored by Legis. Arnold Drucker (D-Plainview) and Legis. Debra Mulé (D-Freeport). The measure resembles legislation that passed last year in Suffolk County, and in New York City in 2017. Convictions would carry penalties of up to a year in jail time and a $1,000 fine. The bill also would allow victims to sue for damages and other relief.
Backers said the legislation would bring relief to victims who suffer humiliation and may lose employment or career opportunities as a result of images posted to social media or distributed via digital message.
"This legislation fills a hole in the legal system," said Mulé. "Crimes of this sort were not able to be addressed in the past. The law needs to keep up with technology,"
Drucker said, "This was really an example of how government should work where you get complete bipartisan support for the type of legislation we were elected to enact, that which protects our residents, our citizens."
Carmen DiBartolomeo, 45, a librarian from North Merrick, testified at a committee hearing that revenge porn hurt her family.
In 2016, her brother, John Rosalia of Oceanside, was in the midst of a bitter divorce when his then-wife distributed images of his genitals via text message to several family members.
Due to shame and other contributing factors, Rosalia took his own life in 2016 at the age of 46, DiBartolomeo said.
DiBartolomeo, who was present for the legislative vote Monday, said of Rosalia, "I can't change what happened to him but I can fight to change so it doesn't happen to somebody else." 
Other advocates of the bill say the legislation will help better define the meaning of consent between sexual partners.
Elizabeth Osowiecki, an educator at the Safe Center, a Bethpage nonprofit that aids victims of sexual violence, said the, "legislation will send a message that consent is important even via technology, and our laws must reflect this."
Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said the law sends a "strong and unified message that this conduct will not be tolerated."  She previously wrote the legislature in support of the bill. 
"When I started my career as a domestic violence prosecutor, social media and smartphones didn't exist. Now, more than two decades later, domestic violence abusers are adapting technology to harass and intimidate their partners. Too many people - particularly young women - are being shamed, humiliated and harmed with threats of revenge porn," Singas said.  
County Executive Laura Curran backs the bill. Her spokeswoman Christine Geed said the measure will "protect potential victims from personal and professional humiliation and other potential ramifications of 'revenge porn.'"
Also Tuesday, Nassau lawmakers unanimously approv

LONG ISLAND: EUGENE MURRAY, LONGTIMEMAYOR OF ROCKVILLE CENTRE

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eugene J. Murray, the longest-serving mayor in Rockville Centre history, died Tuesday at his home.
He was first elected to a four-year term as mayor in 1987 and ran unopposed until 2007, a record 20-year stretch. When he left office, the village hall was named in his honor.
Murray died of natural causes, his family said. He was 93.
"He led Rockville Centre for 20 years, and he was and continues to be the greatest man this village has ever seen," said Francis X. Murray, Eugene's son and the current Rockville Centre mayor. "He did it with love and compassion with everyone he ran into."
Eugene Murray administered the oath of office to his son in 2011. "He taught all of his eight children a great work ethic," his son said.
Murray served in World War II and saw combat with the 71st Infantry Division in France and Germany. When he left the army in 1946, he founded the Murray Floor Waxing Service. The business, which he ran for four decades, remains in the family.
He married Mary Lou Bernhardi of East Rockaway on Dec. 27, 1947, and they had eight children. He built up his business, joined the village's volunteer fire department and became active in village life.
Before serving as mayor, Murray was on the village's board of trustees for three years. An active member of the fire department for more than 72 years, he served as chief from 1977 to 1983. The village Chamber of Commerce gave him its first "Businessman of the Year" award.
 As mayor, Murray established the RVC Community Fund for residents and charities. He served as president of the New York Conference of Mayors in 2003 and 2004 and was a past president of the Nassau County Village Officials Association.
Among the honors for his public service were being named "Man of the Year" in 1993 by Molloy College, which awarded him an honorary law doctorate in 1994, and "Citizen of the Year" in 1997 by the RVC Kiwanis Club. Other organizations that recognized him included the Nassau County Boy Scouts Council, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Guiding Light Lodge of the Masonic Order.
Born Aug. 10, 1925, in Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, Murray grew up in the village and never left except to go to war, his son said. He was one of 13 children and the son of the village's longtime postmaster. Murray graduated from St. Agnes High School and was a eucharistic minister and a lector.
"He was a man of great faith," Francis Murray said. "He went to Mass every day. He had wonderful ethics."
His wife died in 2013 after 66 years of marriage. Murray is also predeceased by his children Teresa and Larry Murray.
In addition to Francis Murray, Murray is survived by five other children, Mary Lou Marquardt of Rockville Centre, Jean Joyce of Rockville Centre, Rosemary Murray of Oceanside, Anne Hayden of Inwood and Thomas Murray of Massapequa; as well as his 26 grandchildren and 35 great-grandchildren.
Services will be held Thursday from 7 to 9 p.m. and Friday from 4 to 8 p.m. at the St. Agnes Parish Center. A funeral Mass is set for Saturday at 9:30 a.m. at St. Agn

Snubs and surprises: Lamar, Carlile in top categories for Grammy

Full text: Kendrick Lamar could follow his Pulitzer Prize win with some Grammys, as the rapper behind the "Black Panther" soundtrack landed eight nominations, including nods in all three of the top categories, in a year filled with snubs and surprises.
It's no surprise that Lamar will face off a lot with commercial juggernaut Drake, who received seven nominations, including in all three top categories. Drake's "God's Plan" will take on Lamar and SZA's "All the Stars" in both song of the year and record of the year categories, while his "Scorpion" album takes on the "Black Panther" soundtrack for album of the year. However, singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile's appearance in all three top categories, for her song "The Joke" and album "By the Way, I Forgive You" was unexpected, as was her status as the most-nominated female artist, with her six nods.
However, the absence of Taylor Swift, who has already won album of the year twice in her career, and Ariana Grande, whose "Sweetener" has been a critical and commercial success, from the categories was even more shocking, especially because The Recording Academy expanded the top categories from five nominees to eight this year. Swift's "Reputation" managed only a best pop vocal album nomination, where it will go up against "Sweetener" and albums from Camila Cabello, Kelly Clarkson, Shawn Mendes and Pink. Grande also received a nomination for "God Is a Woman" in the best pop solo performance category.
The best new artist category was also filled with surprises, especially since Cardi B, who secured five nominations, was ruled ineligible for the category because of nominations she received before her debut was released. Nominations went to pop singers Chloe X Halle, H.E.R., Dua Lipa, Bebe Rexha, and Jorja Smith, country singers Luke Combs and Margo Price and rockers Greta Van Fleet.
Several Long Island artists landed nominations as well. Oceanside native Scott Harris received a song of the year nomination for co-writing Shawn Mendes' hit "In My Blood." Floral Park native John Williams is up for two awards for his "John Williams at The Movies" album, for best engineered album and best classical compendium, where he will compete with Lynbrook native Jeffrey Biegel, nominated as part of the London Symphony Orchestra on Kenneth Fuchs' "Piano Concerto, 'Spiritualist'." Farmingdale native Tim Kubart's "Building Blocks" will be up for best children's album, an award he won in 2016. Valley Stream's Shaggy landed a best reggae album nomination for "44/876" his collaboration with Sting. East Hampton's Laurie Anderson received a best chamber music/small ensemble performance nomination for "Landfall," her collaboration with the Kronos Quartet about superstorm Sandy.
The Grammys will be handed out on Feb. 10 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.

What I love about my big family

Author: Hickey, Dylan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I have a big family. I am one of nine kids! I have five older siblings and three younger siblings, plus a nephew. The oldest is Timmy - he is 27. He is a great big brother and always looks out for me and my siblings. The youngest is my nephew Braden. He is 4 and very lovable! As you can imagine, living with 12 people can be crazy sometimes, but it can be a lot of fun, too.
For example, it is always a lot of fun on Easter. All of the younger kids are always so excited to look for the Easter eggs. All my younger siblings beg my parents to wake everyone up early in the morning so they can look for the Easter eggs. But my parents usually say no and to wait for everyone to wake up. So we get to play with some of the toys we get.
Another great thing about having a big family is if you have to go somewhere, there are many people to take you. On the other hand, since there are a lot of people, it takes longer to get out of the house when we are all going somewhere because there is usually someone who is not ready.
Another good thing about having a big family is if you have a messy room you can just ask someone in your family to help. If I need help, I usually ask my sister and brother, but there is always a possibility that they will say no. Which means I will need to clean the room by myself, which is never fun. Considering the person I share a room with is my little brother, Liam, he sometimes doesn't want to clean the mess. So then it will take longer to clean the room. The only people who have rooms that they don't have to share with another person are my parents and my oldest brother.
Another good thing is when I have dinner, there are no certain seats that we have to sit in. We also sometimes help make dinner, and there are always enough people to help clean it up.
Having a big family, I know they will always support me. Having 12 people who love and care about me is the greatest thing in the world. I wouldn't want to live any other way without my big, enjoyable family.

Federal judge refers LI attorney to lawyer grievance panel

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Three months after they had a shouting match in court, Brooklyn U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis slammed Long Island criminal defense lawyer Joseph Conway on Friday by referring his conduct on an appeal to a lawyer grievance committee.
Garaufis, in a 9-page opinion, said Conway "abandoned" client David Gotterup by failing to file a timely notice of appeal of his 135-month sentence in a fraud case and called his behavior "inexcusable as a matter of ethics and professionalism."
Conway is a former federal prosecutor who headed the U.S. Attorney's criminal division on Long Island and has become a high-profile criminal defense lawyer in Mineola whose notable clients included disgraced Suffolk County Police Chief James Burke and restaurateur Harendra Singh.
The judge said he was referring the case - in which Conway contended he told Gotterup he would have to handle the filing himself - to the Committee on Grievances in federal court as well as the chief judge of New York state's Appellate Division for Long Island.
Conway, in an emailed statement, said, "I have practiced in the EDNY (Eastern District of New York) for over 25 years and have not had any complaints of any type whatsoever about my practice and work efforts or ethics. I wholeheartedly disagree with the decision and look forward to an opportunity to present my case."
Gotterup, 37, of Oceanside, whose father was killed in 1991 in a notorious mob murder, pleaded guilty to running a mortgage fraud scheme. He was sentenced to 15 years in March, and then Garaufis agreed to reduce it to just over 11 years at a hearing in April.
At the second hearing, Conway argued that sometimes murderers got 15 years, and Garaufis took umbrage.
The judge said Conway didn't know what he was talking about and he didn't appreciate being told he was outside the mainstream. Conway cited his credentials. The exchange got heated and led to Garaufis telling Conway to stop yelling and Conway telling the judge to stop belittling him.
In his Friday ruling on Gotterup's request to pursue an appeal despite filing his notice three days late, Garaufis made no mention of the earlier dispute with Conway, but said the late filing would be permitted because Conway was at fault.
Conway, as the judge told the story, incorrectly decided he could not file the notice when Gotterup said the grounds would be ineffective assistance of counsel, but didn't tell his client to proceed pro se - without a lawyer - clearly enough and also confused Gotterup by continuing to represent him on other aspects of the case.
Gotterup and his brother ultimately filed the notice of appeal themselves, Garaufis said. He also said in his ruling that Gotterup might have a "plausible claim of malpractice" against Conway.

NFL fans react to Trump comments on National Anthem protests

Author: Rieber, Anthony

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Once the national anthems were over, it was just football for fans of the Jets and Giants on Sunday. But before that, political football was in the air.
The issue of some NFL players kneeling in protest during the national anthem and President Trump's statement that players doing so should be "fired" were a hot topic on a hot day before the Jets hosted the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium and the Giants visited the Eagles in Philadelphia.
Opinions varied about the two issues. First, should players kneel during the anthem? And was the President right or wrong in admonishing those who choose to?
"I think not standing . . . is very disrespectful," said Howard Rosenblum of Williston Park at MetLife Stadium. "The owners are paying the players millions and millions of dollars. The owners should request them to stand. If they don't want to stand, it would be up to the owners to penalize them or get rid of them. This is respect for the country. If it wasn't for our military, they might not even have jobs. I'm not sure about how the president said it, but I the NFL players should stand out of respect."
Inside Lincoln Financial Field, Giants fan Shawn Espinosa wore a Landon Collins jersey. Collins was one of three Giants who knelt for the anthem on Sunday along with Damon Harrison and Olivier Vernon. The other players and coaches linked arms on the sideline.
"I think what the players are doing, they are showing how they feel for the injustice that people are going through," said Espinosa, 35, of Atco, N.J. "A lot of times we skip and we forget what's happening and they're the ones that are in the spotlight, so with them kneeling it doesn't bother me. It doesn't disrespect the flag. It actually promotes more of the freedoms that we have as Americans."
One theme most fans seemed to agree on is that Trump may have more important things to worry about.
"I think the president should focus on the big issues we're worried about instead of focusing on the NFL players," said Kevin Robert Goebert, who is from Garden City. "The president should . . . focus on the real problems that face people: hurricanes, people who lost their houses and people who are living in shelters. With all that going on, we need to worry about who is kneeling?"
Said Jeffrey Tunkel of Oceanside: "There are much bigger issues than people using their freedom of speech to non-violently protest."
Clinton Harriott, a former New Yorker now living in New Jersey who said he loves the Eagles and Giants, laughed when asked what he thought of what Trump said.
"What Trump said? Oh, boy," said Harriott, 54. "I don't think nobody should be fired. Nobody. Those guys work and they do everything they're supposed to do, right? So I don't see why you should just pick up somebody and throw them out like that."
Still, Harriott said: "I think they should stand up for . I think they should do what they're supposed to do."

South Shore communities awarded state conservation grants: Hempstead Town receives the largest award, for six projects to count terrapin, build a reef, study pollutants and improve Blueway access

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Town of Hempstead has received more than $200,000 in state grants for conservation projects along the South Shore, officials said.
The six grants will allow the town's Department of Conservation and Waterways to count the diamondback terrapin population, construct a reef in Lido Beach, create living shorelines, study pollutants, collect data on the tidal inundation levels of salt marshes and add access points to the South Shore Blueway Trail, state documents show.
"I think the funding definitely opens up new opportunities for research in our bays," said town conservation biologist Tara Schneider-Moran.
Nassau County, the towns of Brookhaven and Islip, and the villages of Freeport, Patchogue and Rockville Centre also received Long Island South Shore Estuary Reserve Local Assistance Grants, which were issued earlier this month by the New York Department of State. The total funds awarded was $668,385. This is the first time the grants have been awarded, State Department spokeswoman Mercedes Padilla said, and they are expected to be given out once a year in the future.
The South Shore Estuary Reserve, an area designated by state law where officials are charged with protecting the water quality and habitats, stretches about 75 miles from the Nassau County/New York City border east to Southampton Village, according to Department of State's website. From south to north, the Reserve is from "the mean high tide line on the ocean side of the barrier islands to the inland limits of the drainage areas," the website said.
Schneider-Moran said Hempstead Town's studies are to include partnerships with Hofstra and Adelphi universities. She said some fieldwork is expected to begin in the spring, but each project has its own timeline.
A $15,570 grant will allow town officials and Hofstra researchers to count the diamondback terrapin in the waters, which could take two years, Schneider-Moran said.
"We don't know what the population in our bays is here," she said.
A $28,442 grant is allocated to construct a reef in the Long Beach High School Research Pond in Lido Beach with Adelphi. The money is also to be used to collect clam and oyster shells from local restaurants and seafood businesses. Schneider-Moran said the shells are a "limited resource that's hard to get."
And $50,000 is to add access points to the Blueway Trail, a network of water routes and launches along Nassau's South Shore, in Oceanside Park, Newbridge Park, Cedar Creek Park and Seamans Neck Park, Hempstead Town Councilman Anthony D'Esposito said in an interview.
Other funds are to be used to study the town's salt marshes and the effects of tidal inundation and sea-level rise, create living shorelines that would stabilize salt marshes and limit erosion, and collect samples to trace heavy metals such as arsenic, iron, mercury and lead, through the South Shore's aquatic food chain, officials said.
"It's definitely going to help us stabilize the South Shore wetlands," D'Esposito said, calling the South Shore's waterways a part of life for many Hempstead Town residents. "These grants will assist in making sure we prepare for the future and sustain that."
THEY GOT THE FUNDS

Element Seafood review: New arrival on old site in Great Neck

Full text: Element Seafood
20 S. Station Plaza, Great Neck
516-829-9888, elementseafood.com
COST $$-$$$
SERVICE Halting, uneven, friendly
AMBIENCE Suburban hipster
ESSENTIALS Open six days, 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays and 10 p.m. weekends; closed Monday. Reservations only for 8 or more; major credit cards accepted; wheelchair accessible.
Element Seafood is the new arrival opposite the Great Neck railroad station, where earlier restaurants lasted slightly longer than the commute from Penn.
This one earns a longer run, with its appealing oyster bar upfront and a streamlined dining room just beyond. It's full of repurposed wood, waterside photos, art of oyster shells, a chart illustrating mollusks.
So, either at the bar or in the main room, order a sampler of East Coast and West Coast oysters, lately starring creamy briny Wellfleets and sweet-smooth Kumamotos, as well as mild and satisfying Blue Points. There are plenty of beers to go with them, including excellent contributions from Barrier Brewing Co. in Oceanside and the Brooklyn Brewery.
The scene of contented slurpers suggests a stop at the bar tables is the ideal way to recover from any rush-hour miseries.
These preliminaries should put you in the right mood for Element's finfish and shellfish dishes. The owners are seafood wholesalers and offer a tasty catch.
That starts with a fine, balanced New England-style clam chowder, which comes with the obligatory packet of Westminster Oyster Crackers.
The house's tuna crudo is respectable, though overly decorated with sesame seeds and rounds of radish. Instead, try either the dependably generous, very traditional shrimp cocktail or the meaty, well-seasoned crabcake.
Skip the spongy, bland shrimp balls sent out afloat in soy-ginger broth; and the tepid, industrial-strength "crispy shrimp," an anesthetized appetizer than can't be revived with pasty, cardamom-tomato jam. Red snapper pho benefits from glass noodles and Thai basil, but it's still overcooked and aswim in watery soup.
Element perks up again with flavorful main courses. The whole branzino is stuffed with a forest of thyme and rosemary that boost the often-boring bass. What's billed as bouillabaisse stays closer to these shores than the Mediterranean but delivers enough saffron and fennel plus fresh seafood.
Seared tuna, accented with white beans and black olives, is a hefty, sliced steak that could be rosier but will do. Salmon shows up boosted by a soy-ginger glaze and pickled shiitake mushrooms And the ample entree of fish and chips has the right crunch and moist, snowy, flaky cod.
If anyone who can't stand seafood has been brought here, Element also prepares a tender, marinated and grilled chicken breast, accompanied by jasmine rice, Provencal-style vegetables and chimichurri.
The best dessert is a lush bread pudding threaded with chocolate. In order, it's followed by a husky, rich wedge of chocolate cake; a fruity but soggy spin on apple crisp; and a strawberry shortcake that announces it's December.
Order carefully and you'll enjoy Element Seafood at least as much as Katerina Ristorante Italiano - and a lot more than its other stationside memories.

A sunny Sunday in the forecast for Long Island

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The best weather of an otherwise cold and rainy weekend on Long Island is expected on Sunday when dry conditions, mostly sunny skies are predicted with highs around 56.
"We have some improvements coming in - some nice improvements as we go into Sunday," said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Rich Von Ohlen. "Sunday, Monday we got two dry days - the next big chance of rain is Tuesday and also going into Thursday."
David Stark, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton, said that in the past few weeks there's been a persistent pattern of quiet and then unsettled weather that is expected to continue for at least the next week.
"It's from an active jet stream pattern that drives the weather - it's basically been going north to east across the U.S.," Stark said. "It looks like the pattern's going to remain for at least the next seven days."
But Stark said temperatures will be near or slightly above normal for much of the week.
Von Ohlen said the Sunday turnaround is due to some "nicer weather coming down from Canada," but he said not to expect more consistent springlike weather until the middle of this month.
On Sunday look for the mercury to climb to 57 in Coram; 53 in Oceanside, Lindenhurst and Setauket; 52 in Southampton; and 51 in Southold, Von Ohlen said. Seasonable overnight lows will be around 35 degrees.
Mostly sunny skies return to start things off on Monday before clouds move in later in the day. Highs will reach near 52, but rain moves in overnight when lows will again be near 35.
Tuesday will bring the next fast-moving spring storm, which will likely bring showers and perhaps heavy rain and a thunderstorm. Highs will be near 52, but it will be windy with gusts from 20 to 40 mph. The low will be 40.
A mix of sun and clouds is ahead for Wednesday with highs near 55 and lows warming up to near 42.
More showers put a damper on Thursday when another mix of sun and clouds is forecast along with late-day showers and highs near 56 and lows near 43.
Expect rain early on Friday when it will remain cloudy throughout the day. Highs are predicted near 55 and lows near 40.
Stark said the normal high for this time of year is about 54 and the low 37.

Farmingdale the top seed in Nassau Conference I for a reason

Author: Kramer, Ari

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]20 Aug 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1812600340?accountid=37869

Abstract: The Dalers also add running back and Plainedge transfer Corey Hill, who earned all-county honors alongside the record-breaking Davien Kuinlan last year.

Full text:   At Farmingdale, tradition greets you at the gate.
A banner hangs at midfield, listing the accomplishments of past Dalers football teams.
The 21 conference championships. The eight Long Island runner-up finishes. The one Long Island title, in 2001.
There's still room for the 2015 conference title and LIC appearance and many championships to come. As the 2016 season approaches, the belief at Farmingdale - and around Nassau Conference I - is that the Dalers are the favorite to add more trophies to an already illustrious history.
"We're the one seed, and we think we're the one seed," said Buddy Krumenacker, entering his 23rd year as head coach. "It wasn't like, well, somebody gave us the one seed. I raised my hand for the one seed because three of the last four years we've been the champion, and we think we can do that again with who we've got back here."
Chris Erkens is the only returning offensive lineman, but Krumenacker expects the offense to hardly skip a beat.
That's because the Dalers, who beat Oceanside in the 2015 Nassau championship before falling to Longwood in the LIC, return one of Long Island's most potent backfields as well as quarterbacks Anthony Burriesci and Tommy Donovan.
Senior running back Jordan McLune rushed 223 times for 1,985 yards and 35 touchdowns last season. Kevin Eversley, who primarily blocked for McClune at fullback, ran 78 times for 511 yards and seven touchdowns.
The Dalers also add running back and Plainedge transfer Corey Hill, who earned all-county honors alongside the record-breaking Davien Kuinlan last year.
"We already have a relationship, and we already have a standard so we know what we can do," said the 5-9, 190-pound McClune, who opposing coaches widely consider the conference's top player.
At quarterback, the Dalers will have some flexibility. Donovan began last season as the starter but tore his ACL in Week 7. Burriesci replaced him and kept Farmingdale undefeated through an MVP performance in the county championship.
Burriesci clearly has the ability to throw the ball -- he completed 36 of 68 passes for 660 yards and eight touchdowns last year -- but he is athletic enough to return kicks and play in the slot when he's not under center.
On defense, the Dalers will be led by Darrin Simons at cornerback, Eversley at defensive end and Hill at linebacker.
With so much talent returning from an 11-1 team, McClune thinks the Dalers deserved the top seed.
"We earned it with the Nassau title, going undefeated ," he said. "It's not like they just gave it to us. They gave it to us for a reason."

MTA: $5M is 'major step forward' for safety at grade crossings: Federal funds to pay for LIRR, Metro-North improvements New cameras, signs, traffic control devices to be installed

Abstract: Sarah Feinberg, administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration, joined Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Thomas Prendergast, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-Rye) and other elected officials to highlight new FRA grant funding totaling $5,162,417 for the MTA's two commuter railroads, the LIRR and Metro-North.

Full text:   MTA and federal officials on Monday applauded more than $5 million in new spending to improve safety at grade crossings throughout the region, including along the Long Island Rail Road.
Sarah Feinberg, administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration, joined Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Thomas Prendergast, Rep. Nita Lowey (D-Rye) and other elected officials to highlight new FRA grant funding totaling $5,162,417 for the MTA's two commuter railroads, the LIRR and Metro-North.
The money comes from new funding in the recently passed $305 billion federal highway bill and from an additional $25 billion pot that Lowey helped secure. New York got the largest share of the grant funding.
"There is no state more focused on improving grade crossing safety at the moment than New York," Feinberg said at a news conference at Metro-North's North White Plains station. "These grants are confirmation that New York is headed in the right direction."
Thomas Prendergast said the new funds will pay for cameras at 43 LIRR and Metro-North crossings to investigate accidents and analyze operations; new traffic control devices at crossings in Deer Park and Oceanside; and "more and better" signs and pavement markings at many other crossings.
"Safety is the MTA's absolute top priority and this grant represents a major step forward in our efforts to put safety at the foundation of every single aspect of the services we provide," Prendergast said.
Prendergast said the planned upgrades are "in addition to a massive effort already underway" to improve railroad crossing safety at the MTA. The initiative was sparked by a February 2015 incident in which a Metro-North train struck a sport utility vehicle on the tracks at a Valhalla crossing, killing six people and injuring another 15.
Those improvements have included a new crossings safety public awareness ad campaign, increased police enforcement at crossings, and a partnership with Operation Lifesaver, a national crossing safety advocacy group that is training LIRR and Metro-North employees. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo earlier this year also approved legislation that increases the frequency of safety inspections and crossings, and raises fines for railroads that don't immediately and properly report crossing incidents to the state.
The LIRR and state Department of Transportation also plan to eliminate seven crossings in Nassau as part of the proposed project to construct a third track between Floral Park and Hicksville. Prendergast added that the MTA is also embracing new crossing safety technology, and that the agency and Cuomo will be announcing more crossing safety initiatives in coming weeks.
Feinberg said, nationally, the FRA is also looking for ways to use technology to reduce crossing accidents, including by negotiating with tech companies, including Google, to modify mapping applications to warn drivers when they are approaching a crossing.

Fishing for sea bass is still legal in New York State waters

Author: Schlichter, Tom

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]23 Sep 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1822325760?accountid=37869

Abstract: Fishing near the third Wantagh Bridge with clam baits intended for stripers, the 48-year old avid angler drilled a 13-pound brute that may end up being recognized as a NYS record for the species (there is no current state record for sheepshead.) "That fish was so big that its teeth were starting to decay!" said Ed Walsh, who officially weighed the beast at Jones Beach Bait and Tackle and called the porgy-shaped brute "impressive."

Full text:   All good things must come to an end, and so we said goodbye to the 2016 fluke season on Wednesday. While spotty in some areas, this year was noteworthy for the outlandish number of trophy fish it produced.
Doormat action had for the past month been unparalleled at Montauk, and South Shore anglers working ocean reefs and wrecks from Shinnecock to Jones inlets also made quite a few "personal best" catches, even while concentrating on mixed-bag scores of porgy, sea bass, triggerfish and blues.
Also closing Wednesday was black sea bass fishing in federal waters (more than 3 miles offshore.) While sea bass remain fair game in New York State waters (inshore of the 3-mile line) the tasty sea biscuits will be off limits in the federal zone until Oct. 22. At that time, both state and federal waters are open for the taking of sea bass through Dec. 31.
The closure of sea bass season in federal waters is a blow to wreck fishermen in particular, since many offshore structure pieces are covered with knob-headed lunkers at this time of the year. Those fish will have to be released even while anglers continue to pursue blackfish, pollock and cod. Take note, also, that if you plan to target both sea bass in New York State waters and other species farther offshore, you need to fish the federal waters first, then come back inside to catch sea bass in state waters.
On a bright note, porgies are still feeding with abandon just about everywhere, crabbing remains solid along the South Shore, and blackfish season is set to open on Oct. 5. Hunters should also be getting ready for archery season, which commences in Suffolk County on Oct. 1.
There are also ample opportunities to sharpen your skills, have some fun and gain a little hands-on knowledge available in the coming days. At River Bay Outfitters in Oceanside (riverbayoutfitters.com 516-415-7748) for example, Paul McCain will be leading a South Shore Orientation Trip on Saturday. He'll be visiting eight different fishing access points from the western South Shore to Moriches Inlet. These are legal access sites, points out McCain, but none are obvious on a map. Reservations are required.
Monster sheepshead caught
Once numerous in our waters, sheepshead are now primarily a southern species and caught only infrequently around Long Island. Peter Kruczko of Seaford, however, made the most of his encounter with one on Tuesday's incoming tide.
Fishing near the third Wantagh Bridge with clam baits intended for stripers, the 48-year old avid angler drilled a 13-pound brute that may end up being recognized as a NYS record for the species (there is no current state record for sheepshead.)
"That fish was so big that its teeth were starting to decay!" said Ed Walsh, who officially weighed the beast at Jones Beach Bait and Tackle and called the porgy-shaped brute "impressive."
Kruczko said the big sheepshead fought a straight up-and-down battle in the 15-foot depths, and at first felt like a double-digit blackfish at the end of the line.
"I've never caught anything like this around here," he chuckled. "But that's what makes fishing so exciting - you never know what's going to take your bait next."

Longtime LIU Post coach and teacher James L. Davey dead

Author: Spangler, Nicholas

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]04 Feb 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1762296772?accountid=37869

Abstract: Under Davey, the wrestling program won two NCAA Division II national championships and three conference titles, producing 15 All-Americans, 38 intercollegiate champions and five NCAA Outstanding Wrestler award-winners.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
James L. Davey, a central figure in Long Island wrestling who founded the team at LIU Post, died Jan. 27 at Northport Veterans Hospital. He was 91.
The cause of death was multiple cancers, said a son-in-law, Robert Stock.
As a nimble 123-pounder out of Valley Stream Central High School in the late 1930s, Davey won the South Shore championship, Mepham Invitational and Long Island titles. He fought with the Marines in the Pacific in World War II and returned to coach at Cortland State College and South Side in Rockville Centre and Oceanside high schools.
But it was at the then-C.W. Post, where he arrived in 1955, taught phys-ed 32 years and coached 22, that he made his mark. Under Davey, the wrestling program won two NCAA Division II national championships and three conference titles, producing 15 All-Americans, 38 intercollegiate champions and five NCAA Outstanding Wrestler award-winners.
He arrived at Post just a year after the school's founding and made a practice of recruiting locally.
Davey was inducted into the New York State Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1979 and was honored by the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1997 for Lifetime Service to Wrestling.
LIU Post inducted Davey into its athletic hall of fame in 2005 and named its wrestling room after him last year. "He was the architect," said Bryan Collins, the school's athletic director. "He's been here for everything we've done."
James Louis Davey was born June 10, 1924, in Valley Stream. His father was a bus mechanic. His mother died when he was 12.
Davey enlisted in the Marines after Pearl Harbor. After the war he married his high school sweetheart, Jane Murphy, and attended Cortland, where he served as wrestling player-coach, on the GI Bill. He later earned a master's degree in special education from Hofstra University.
The couple spent much of their time in Smithtown and East Setauket, where they lived in a log cabin Davey had built from a kit.
Ed Rufrano, who wrestled under Davey 1968-1972, recalled "a fantastic technician."
"He had a way of taking a lot of the stress that young men feel in wrestling away and putting it in the proper perspective," Rufrano said. "Lighten it up, come on, go out there and have fun."
Davey was celebrated at Long Island Wrestling Day at Post in early January, an event attended by hundreds of wrestlers, many of whom he'd coached. Rufrano, who runs a millwork company, had made a sign: Coach Jim Davey Wrestling Room, in 14 feet wide green and gold, the school colors.
"He was shocked," Rufrano said.
Davey is survived by his wife, of Ridge; brothers William, of Middle Island, and Ken, of Hyde Park; daughters Kathy Stock, of Port Jefferson, Sally Davey, of Hercules, California, and Terry Davey, of Stony Brook; sons Dale, of Lewiston, California, Wade, of Wading River, and James, of Stony Brook. He was preceded in death by a brother, Ed, of Merrick, and sisters Rose Long of Northport and Chickie Fry of Ocean Pines, Maryland.
The family said there were no services.

New coffee businesses offer roasts, cold brew and more

Author: Marcus, Erica

Abstract: Vetter has enjoyed it in an "Irish goodbye" with Baileys Irish Cream, or a cold-brew old-fashioned with bourbon, cold brew and The Bitter Truth's Spiced Chocolate bitters.

Full text:   Sail Away Coffee Co.
Cold brew is the newest darling of the coffee cognoscenti. Soaking beans for up to 24 hours in cold water results in a mellow beverage that's less acidic than traditional hot-water methods. That's the theory, anyway. Chris Vetter, owner of Sail Away Coffee Co., found that while "the concept was smooth, easy drinking, too many of the cold brews on the market were astringent and overly strong."
For his cold brew, Vetter blends Central American and Kenyan beans for a flavor with "different chocolate tones with little notes of cherry at the end." He sells it both unsweetened and lightly sweetened in 10-ounce bottles that retail for between $3.50 and $4 at about 50 locations including Southdown Markets, North Shore Farms, Iavarone Bros., Suburban Eats (Melville) and Grace's Marketplace (Greenvale). All locations are listed at sailawaycoffee.com.
Sail Away is also making a splash with its "Nitro" cold brew on tap. The introduction of nitrogen gives the coffee a thick, creamy head. "It's got the same mouth-feel as a Guinness stout," Vetter said. Right now, the Nitro is served at Vauxhall in Huntington, Parlay and Press 195 (Rockville Centre), Jackson's (Commack), Tap & Barrel (Smithtown) and Eat Gastropub (Oceanside). Order it neat, or let the bartender have some fun with it. Vetter has enjoyed it in an "Irish goodbye" with Baileys Irish Cream, or a cold-brew old-fashioned with bourbon, cold brew and The Bitter Truth's Spiced Chocolate bitters.
East Coast Roast
Recently off the beat, retired NYPD officer Richard Comuniello could not find a cup of coffee to his liking in his hometown of Island Park. He was also a little bored. Comuniello started roasting at home and, about a year later, he purchased a commercial roaster and installed it in a local warehouse. He drafted wife Maryann and son John into the business and dubbed it East Coast Roast.
East Coast Roast shoots for a balanced, not-too-dark roast, relying on the beans to supply all the flavor. Single origin coffees are sourced from Africa (Uganda Be Kidding!, Kenya Dig It?), Indonesia (Frank Sumatra NY NY, Papua Don't Preach) and South America (Colombia U). Blends include Sweet Dreams Decaf and Moorse Code Espresso.
John, 25, a former television production coordinator, is de facto head of sales and marketing. He sells coffee to about a dozen restaurants and stores including The Clubhouse (Huntington) and Victoria's Market (Woodbury). A complete list of retailers is at ecroast.com. The coffees are also available online where they cost between $12 and $14 a pound. Order whole beans or specify a grind: automatic drip, espresso or French press.

Bratton, de Blasio have talk with Blake

Abstract: Retired tennis star James Blake - mistakenly tackled and arrested by a cop in Manhattan this month - met with Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner William Bratton yesterday and said afterward that the three agreed on the need for police reform.

Full text:   Retired tennis star James Blake - mistakenly tackled and arrested by a cop in Manhattan this month - met with Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner William Bratton yesterday and said afterward that the three agreed on the need for police reform.
Blake said he, de Blasio and Bratton were on "the same page" about NYPD reforms following the 90-minute, closed-door session at City Hall.
He told reporters he was "pleasantly surprised" the two men heard out his points.
"Accountability was really important," Blake said afterward, "not just making short-term changes ... but about having an impact that's going to affect even generations. There's going to be a policy effect."
Blake was body-slammed Sept. 9 at a midtown Manhattan hotel by NYPD Officer James Frascatore of Oceanside.
NYPD officials said Blake resembled a suspected identity thief. Frascatore is on modified duty. His gun and shield have been taken away while an internal affairs probe is conducted.
"I think about the fact that it was unfortunate that it happened, but if it turns into a positive, then it can be a good thing that happened," Blake said.
Asked whether Blake still believes Frascatore should be fired, his attorney, Kevin Marino answered, "We don't have any disrespect for the officer's due process rights."
Marino said he and Blake are "pleased" that Frascatore - seen on surveillance video handling Blake roughly - is on desk duty. Marino said they will meet with the city's corporation counsel but don't necessarily plan to file a lawsuit.
The conversation was "based on a shared commitment to accountability and a desire to build trust," de Blasio and Bratton said in a joint statement after the meeting. "We pledged a fair and expeditious investigation into his case, and to find further common ground as we continue the work of reform."
Blake admitted he may be receiving special treatment in the aftermath of the arrest because he is a celebrity, but said he intended to make the best of it.
"I don't know if I would have had the same voice," the tennis star said. "Life is 10 percent what happens, 90 percent how you react to it, so I'm going to try to react to it in a positive manner and make a difference for all of those who may not have the same situation."

Nearly half shun virus shot: poll

Author: Brodsky, Robert

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nearly half of metro area residents are unsure or would not take a vaccine to combat the spread of the coronavirus if one became available, according to a new poll commissioned by Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital in Oceanside.
The poll, which will be released Wednesday, indicates that Long Island and New York City residents are less likely to travel, use mass transportation or attend large gatherings because of the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 80,000 people across the globe and killed more than 2,700 people, primarily in China.
But although three in four respondents said they had received a flu shot this season, only 55% would become immunized for coronavirus - also known as COVID-19 - if a vaccine became available. Meanwhile, 14% said they would not take the vaccine and 31% said they were unsure.
Dr. Aaron Glatt, chairman of medicine and of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital, said the data could reflect an increased reluctance among the "anti-vaxxer" community to become immunized against a virus that had quickly spread across Asia and Europe.
"I would have expected the number to be higher," Glatt said. "It is concerning that more people are not jumping to take the vaccine."
Overall, women, young people and city residents said they would be more likely to take the vaccine while men, older respondents and Long Islanders expressed greater reluctance, the poll shows.
Although pharmaceutical companies are working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine to stop the spread of the virus, congressional lawmakers said Tuesday that a vaccine may not be available for 12 to 18 months.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are 35 confirmed coronavirus cases nationwide but none in New York State. 
The poll, commissioned in early February, asked 600 residents - including 150 from Nassau and Suffolk - how concerned they were about coronavirus and influenza. 
It found that:
* 62% of respondents have high, or very high concerns, about coronavirus, with 54% saying they are worried about it affecting their family;
* Half of all respondents are confident that federal and state governments are prepared to deal with the outbreak, while 36% disagreed and 14% were unsure;
* More than 70% of respondents are less likely to travel overseas; 48% less likely to use mass transit and 46% less willing to attend large gatherings because of coronavirus.
Meanwhile, only 51% of respondents said they had high or very high concerns about the flu. The CDC estimates there have been at least 29 million influenza illnesses so far this season with 16,000 deat

'SUPPORT PERSON' OK FOR WOMEN GIVING BIRTH

Author: Olson, David

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]30 Mar 2020: 16.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2384121006?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Saturday quashed two major health systems' fledgling bans on visitors - including spouses and partners - accompanying women while they give birth.
Cuomo on Saturday issued an executive order requiring all hospitals to allow one "support person" who does not have a fever to be in the labor and delivery areas.
"In no hospital in New York will a woman be forced to be alone when she gives birth. Not now, not ever," Cuomo tweeted.
On Tuesday, Manhattan-based Mount Sinai Health Systems, which runs Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital in Oceanside, instituted the prohibition to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.
"By implementing this, we create the safest setting for patients, newborns and our health care providers," Dr. Alan Garely, chairman of the OB-GYN department at Mount Sinai South Nassau, told Newsday at the time.
Manhattan-based NewYork-Presbyterian's ban began on Monday.
A change.org petition against the hospitals' moves that was posted March 22 had more than 613,000 signatures by Saturday afternoon.
Mount Sinai on Saturday released a statement that said: "In partnership with New York State, effective today, we will permit one healthy partner to join the expectant mother for labor and delivery. We have always - and will always - make these difficult decisions with the best of intentions and safety of the mother, baby and our staff as our guiding principle."
NewYork-Presbyterian said in a statement: "We will comply with the Executive Order regarding visitors for obstetric patients, effective immediately. Our highest priority continues to be the safety and wellbeing of our patients, their families, and our staff."
Cuomo's move follows the state Health Department's advisory Friday that requires hospitals to allow one support person in labor and delivery settings if the patient wants it, as long as the person has no COVID-19 symptoms and is not suspected of having the virus. A support person is defined in the advisory as a spouse, partner, sibling, doula or any other person the patient chooses. The advisory clarifies a March 21 "guidance" on the matter.
The secretary to the governor, Melissa DeRosa, said at the governor's daily coronavirus update Saturday that "some of the hospitals were ignoring" the guidance, so the Health Department ramped it up Friday to a directive "and we're going to reinforce that in an executive order."

LONG BEACH: CITY TO HALT PICKUP FOR RECYCLING

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 Apr 2020: 26.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The city of Long Beach will suspend recycling collection indefinitely through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials announced Thursday.
City Council president John Bendo announced the change in a robocall to residents and an announcement on the city's website.
The city utilizes single-stream recycling, which involves the manual sorting of cans, bottles and paper.
The city's recycling provider is Omni Recycling of Westbury. Company officials could not be reached for comment Friday.
"Due to the nature of the work, the contractor the City utilizes for recycling has been hit extremely hard by COVID-19 and cannot continue to process single-stream recycling during the pandemic," Bendo said. "We will be resuming City-wide recycling as soon as possible and will communicate any additional changes to the program in the days and weeks ahead."
Officials said they have consulted with the state Department of Environmental Conservation on the plan to suspend residential and commercial pickup, which stopped Friday.
Residents are being asked to include their recycling in regular trash pickup until the pandemic allows workers to resume regular collections.
Long Beach joins the Town of Hempstead and Oceanside in halting recycling collection during the coronavirus pandemic. The town's recycling collection affects communities including Bellmore, Bethpage, East Meadow, Levittown, Lido Beach, Point Lookout, Seaford, Uniondale and Wantagh. Town officials said the policy would be reevaluated each week. Pickup in other sanitation districts and villages is decided separately.
Hempstead town officials said recycling was suspended due to the number of workers who had reported they were sick or quarantined for up to two weeks due to exposure to COVID-19. Hempstead uses a different provider, Westbury Paper Stock Corp., for recycling, which is locked in a legal dispute since last year over the town's contract.
Town officials said Hempstead Town residents can drop off recycling at the homeowner disposal site at the town's sanitation facility in Merrick at 1600 Merrick Rd. from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Monday through Friday and from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on weekends.

Jim Adelis of East Rockaway: Called 'The Lone Ranger' for acts of kindness

Author: Williams, Jeff

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nearly 20 years ago, Jim Adelis was given the nickname, "The Lone Ranger," for all the kind works he did for people, often anonymously.
"For the most part he did things and never took credit," said his son, Jim Jr., on Tuesday. "A lot of people never knew it was him. He did things from the heart and never wanted any recognition."
Adelis died on April 4 at Mount���Sinai South Nassau Hospital from complications of the coronavirus, his family said. He was 67.
Adelis, of East Rockaway, owned a prominent private security firm, Adelis International Security, that operated largely out of Kennedy Airport.
"My father was my hero because he lost his father when he was 14," Jim Jr. said. "He wasn't even a high school graduate, he had to drop out to support the family back then. He turned himself into a very successful businessman on his own."
When Jim Jr. was deployed to Iraq as an Army specialist in 2003, his father supported���his son's unit on the front lines and remained a constant supporter of the military.
"He had all the connections," said his son. Jim Jr. said his father was supportive of his unit and sent the platoon food and other supplies.
Adelis established a Trees for Troops program through Dees' Nursery in Oceanside that sent Christmas trees to the military overseas. Last December marked���its 16th year, and a total of 13,000 trees have been sent.
He also was the chairman of the Building Homes for Heroes golf outing at Rockville Links Club, where he has been a member for more than 20 years. That organization, based in Island Park, builds or renovates homes for wounded veterans.
"Jimmy prided himself on being an honest man, that was very important to him. Always do to others what you would want them to do to you," said his wife of 36 years, Lucy. "That's what I loved about him, that no one was better than anyone else. He would always say that we all have the same red blood."
Adelis is survived by his wife and sons, James Jr. and Thomas, all of���East Rockaway. ���A memorial service will be held���later in the year. ���

Full text: Posh Ultra Lounge is reopening for one night only ... online. 
The former Garden City Hotel nightclub will livestream the "Posh Classics Virtual Reunion" on Facebook's Classics group and WPTY/"Party" 105.3 FM Saturday, May 2, at 8 p.m. featuring DJ sets from Theo Pisani and Dimitri Tee with special guest singers Kim Sozzi and George LaMond. 
The event, produced by Posh creator Brian Rosenberg, will serve as a fundraiser for House Music for Heroes, a nonprofit organization run by the Classics group, which provides the meals for health care workers at Northwell Health's North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Stony Brook University Hospital and Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside.
"My good friend Matty Camarda, the administrator of the Facebook Classics group, and myself decided to create the fundraiser House Music for Heroes to show our gratitude to the health care workers here on Long Island who are putting their lives at risk during this pandemic," says Tee of Syosset, who was Posh's Saturday night resident DJ. "They, along with all the essential workers, are the real heroes of this virus war."
The event will take place from an undisclosed location in Suffolk County, where the entire club experience will be recreated by Mobile Stage Network of Copiague. The DJs will spin for two hours each and multiple cameras will capture their audience-free performances.
"I'm going to play all the big hands-in-the-air records from that time like 'Pump It Up' by Danzel and 'Appreciate Me' by Amuka," says Pisani of Commack, who was Posh's Thursday night resident DJ. "There will be Posh pictures, videos, lights, visual effects and more. It will look very vibrant on your computer screen."
Tee plans on bringing the old Posh magic back.
"In my heart, Posh will always be the Studio 54 of the Long Island nightlife scene," he says. "I will be spinning and mixing together a lot of the big house music and electro dance tracks from the Posh era" (2003-07).
Viewers can watch the event at facebook.com/groups/classicnitelife or listen on "Party" 105.3 FM from 8 p.m. to midnight. Visit: gofundme.com/f/classics-group-cares to do

Enjoyed painting with daughter, travel

Author: Lauterbach, Jordan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One afternoon last fall, Constance Nurge rediscovered one of the great loves of her life: painting.
In her younger days, the longtime North Merrick resident was always painting household items, cleaning them up and giving them a fresh feel with hand-stenciled floral motifs.
As her focus shifted toward raising a family, Nurge lost touch with painting until her daughter, Kim Nurge, suggested that it might be something they could do together.
"I thought it might be a nice activity where the two of us take a canvas and paint together," said Kim Nurge, 53, of Head of the Harbor.
Nurge's new focus was abstract art, something her daughter said she took to quite nicely.
"I was just so impressed with it," Kim Nurge said. "It came out great. She really enjoyed doing it and that became our normal thing."
Nurge, a breast cancer survivor, died April 12 from complications of COVID-19 at Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, her family said. She was 87.
"She was a very sweet and caring woman," said her son, Eric Nurge, 54, of North Merrick. "She would do anything she could for people."
Known as "Connie" to most, Nurge was born on July 8, 1932, in New Jersey. She moved to East Williston as a teenager after her father took a job on Long Island. She graduated from Roslyn High School, where she was named "best dressed." She went to SUNY Farmingdale before beginning a short career as a mechanical drawer at Airborne Instruments in Mineola, which she left in the mid-1950s to become a homemaker and raise her three children. 
Nurge married her husband of 65 years, Ernest, in November 1954 at the Community Church in East Williston. The couple briefly lived in Oceanside before moving to North Merrick in spring 1955, where Nurge would live for 65 years.
Nurge loved to travel, taking her children to Disney World and the Bahamas. After Ernest retired in 1992, the two traveled even more, visiting Europe multiple times, taking a cruise down the Panama Canal, and driving along the U.S. West Coast with her sister and brother-in-law, the late Neicy and Bill Fauth of Huntington.
"Every time I turned around, they were traveling someplace else," Eric Nurge said. "They were always going somewhere or doing something."
In addition to her husband, son and daughter, Nurge is survived by son Ernest III of North Merrick. She was buried in the All Faiths Lutheran Cemetery in Middle Village. The family will hold a memorial at a later date.

A last hurrah for Stepanek: Northport senior will try to add to four state titles

Author: Kersich, Peter

Abstract: None available.

Full text: ITHACA, N.Y. -Time flies when you're having fun.
Northport's Chloe Stepanek was only an eighth-grader the first time she appeared at the girls swimming and diving state championship in 2015.
Since then, she has broken numerous records and has won four state titles.
When reality hit on Friday that she would be participating in her fifth and final state championship of her illustrious high school tenure, she found it incomprehensible.
"During the senior walk prior to the start of prelims, I was like 'wow I can't believe I'm actually a senior,'" Stepanek said. "I think it's going to be emotional [Saturday] during the finals when I realize that this is my last 200 [yard] medley relay, last 200 freestyle and last 100 freestyle."
Stepanek, who swims for the combined Northport/Commack team, had the top qualifying times in both the 200 free (1:47.11) and the 100 free (49.48) during the preliminary heats at the Kelsey Partridge Bird Natatorium at Ithaca College.
She will be seeking her third consecutive individual state crown in each event.
"I try to not focus on the time, and just focus on racing and having fun because that's when I swim my best," the two-time Newsday Long Island Swimmer of the Year said.
Oceanside senior Catherine Stanford had the fastest time in the 50 free (23.01) and was second behind Stepanek in the 100 free (50.44). She will be looking for her second straight state title in the 50 free.
"The real test will come [Saturday]. I want to go out with a bang," Stanford said. "I am going to put my all into it because I know I won't be here next year."
Sacred Heart shined during the prelims, as its 200 medley relay (1:43.68) and 400 free relay (3:30.55) each finished with the top qualifying time. The 200 medley relay was comprised of Tess Howley, Cavan Gormsen, Joan Cash and Ariana Brattoli, and the 400 free relay featured Howley, Gormsen, Cash and Rebecca Konop.
Howley had the quickest time in the 100 butterfly (53.51) and was third in the 100 backstroke (55.73), Gormsen was first in the 500 free (4:49.71) and finished second in the 200 free (1:49.34) and Cash was second in the 50 free (23.43).
Gormsen and Howley, both freshmen, had high praise for their teammates.
"Some of the girls have swam at the states before and were really helpful to all the newcomers," Gormsen said. "They gave us a good layout of the meet to help us prepare."

Hospital eyeing merger: LI Community, an independent, may join Stony Brook

Full text: Long Island's last independent community hospital is a step closer to agreeing to join a larger health system.
Brookhaven-based Long Island Community Hospital's chief executive said in an email this week to staff that the hospital is "focusing" on a possible affiliation agreement with Stony Brook University Hospital.
The board of directors has given CEO Richard T. Margulis clearance to sign a letter of intent with Stony Brook to "begin due diligence," Margulis said in the email, a copy of  which was given to Newsday and verified by a source close to the situation. 
A letter of intent "is not a definitive contract, but rather a document that summarizes the main points of a proposed deal, and signifies a genuine interest in reaching the final agreement subject to due diligence," Margulis wrote.
In a joint statement, Dr. Kenneth Kaushansky, senior vice president of health sciences and dean of Renaissance School of Medicine, and Dr. Margaret McGovern, vice president for health system clinical programs and strategy at Stony Brook Medicine, wrote, "Both entities see the enormous benefits of working together to serve the health care needs of Suffolk County and are looking forward to further advancing their respective goals as Suffolk County's only academic medical center and Long Island Community Hospital's mission as a community hospital." 
In the email, Margulis said the letter of intent is one step in a "lengthy process."
The Island's other former independent hospitals have said they're saving tens of millions of dollars in their operating budgets by leaning on their health system parents - including Stony Brook, Northwell Health and Mount Sinai Health System - to buy medical supplies in bulk, implement updated technology and negotiate contracts with managed-care companies.
Stony Brook in recent years has expanded its hospital and ambulatory network throughout Suffolk County. Stony Brook Southampton Hospital officially joined the health system in 2017 after a process that lasted nearly five years. The deal required multiple state regulatory approvals.
Stony Brook also recently opened a 240,000-square-foot cancer center located on Stony Brook University's East Campus, adjacent and connected to the main hospital. The construction project is part of a larger expansion that also includes a children's hospital.
Other health systems have also expanded recently by taking over formerly independent hospitals. For example, John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson became part of Northwell Health in January 2018. At about the same time, Oceanside-based South Nassau Communities Hospital joined Manhattan-based Mount Sinai Health Syst

EASTERN LI HOSPITAL JOINS STONY BROOK

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stony Brook Medicine said Monday that Eastern Long Island Hospital has officially joined its health-care system.
The Greenport-based hospital has been renamed Stony Brook Eastern Long Island Hospital.
Eastern Long Island has been formally affiliated with Stony Brook since 2006. The 90-bed acute-care hospital agreed to join Stony Brook in 2015.
"Many small and rural hospitals are closing, and this preserves the hospital and allows us to be part of a budding health system," said Paul Connor III, chief administrative officer at Eastern LI.
Officials said Stony Brook plans to expand services in Greenport.
"Behavioral [mental] health will be one of the services we will focus on expanding," said Dr. Kenneth Kaushansky, a senior vice president of health sciences and dean of the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. "We have more behavioral health patients at the university hospital than we can handle, and expanding it at Eastern Long Island will help. Behavioral health is the biggest need at the health system." 
Kaushansky added that Eastern Long Island will be an "education site for students and fellows. About 80 percent of hospitals are community hospitals, not university hospitals, so it makes sense for them to gain experience there."
Stony Brook has been in expansion mode in recent years. It officially took over Stony Brook Southampton Hospital in 2017, about five years after the hospitals agreed to merge.
In June, Brookhaven-based Long Island Community Hospital and Stony Brook said they are focusing on a possible affiliation agreement. Long Island Community is the last remaining independent hospital on Long Island.
Other health systems have also expanded recently by taking over formerly independent hospitals. For example, John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson became part of Northwell Health in January 2018. At about the same time, Oceanside-based South Nassau Communities Hospital joined Manhattan-based Mount Sinai Health System.
Smaller hospitals save considerable money by moving to larger health systems' electronic medical records systems and leveraging purchasing power, said Dr. Margaret McGovern, vice president for health system clinical programs and strategy at Stony Brook Medicine.
"Electronic medical records are quite costly," she said.

FDNY members head to Washington

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New York City firefighters are traveling to Washington, D.C., to urge the Senate to vote to extend aid for Ground Zero first responders when it comes to the floor for a vote on Tuesday.
The bill would guarantee funding for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund for 75 years.
Mayor de Blasio said last week that at least 200 firefighters have died from illnesses related to 9/11.
"This is something that will continue to happen," said Gerald Fitzgerald, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association. "Unfortunately, it's a reminder here in New York City sometimes daily of the sick dying."
Fitzgerald and other FDNY members are going to Washington for the vote. The Senate is scheduled to take up proposed amendments from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) which was part of a deal to bring the bill to a vote. Paul had criticized the legislation saying extending the fund, which expires at the end of the year, would be too expensive.
Fitzgerald said he was not happy with the timing of Paul's comments.
"To pick and choose which bill or which topic you're going to be fiscally responsible on and the way he did it ... his motive was to get headlines and he got them," he said.
But Fitzgerald remained confident the measure will be approved. He and union member George Farinacci plan to try to get a spot in the Senate chamber for the vote.
"We are urging our senators to step up and vote yes," said Farinacci. "Make this right."
Both are confident the Senate will follow the House which passed the bill in June. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he does not foresee any hiccups.
"It's hard to see anything that will get in the way," said Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday. "We persist and most of all, the first responders persist."
The vote is long-awaited for advocates of Ground Zero first responders. In June, former "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart shamed Congress for stalling on the bill. Stewart and former NYPD detective Luis Alvarez each gave emotional testimonies during a House committee hearing on the effects of illnesses on responders and their families. Alvarez, of Oceanside, died of complications from cancer later that month.
"There's a human element to this," said Fitzgerald. These folks need this money to continue their lives and if they're going to pass, their families need this money to stay in or maintain their homes or fulfill the dreams they had to their loved ones in the future."

6 swimmers rescued by Long Beach lifeguards

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Six people, including two children, were rescued when they ran into trouble swimming off Long Beach after lifeguards went off duty Friday night, authorities said.
The boy and a man were taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, said Long Beach lifeguard captain Steve Lieberman, who helped direct the rescue effort.
Lieberman said he was cleaning equipment when he got a call about distressed swimmers, shortly after the lifeguard watch ended at 6 p.m., leaving only an emergency lifeguard team of five people.
Then Lieberman said he heard a plea over the radio: "We have six people in the water. We need more rescuers."
When he pulled up onto the scene near Riverside Boulevard, he could see one of his lifeguards in the water by the jetty and two swimmers climbing up onto the rocks. Another lifeguard was paddling back to the beach with a swimmer on his surfboard, then went back out to help carry the boy out of the water, he said. Another group of lifeguards was pulling out a swimmer. 
"The water was bad when I got up there," Lieberman said. "It was really choppy."
Altogether 10 lifeguards went into the water and firefighters on shore helped tend to the victims, said Long Beach Fire Commissioner Scott Kemins. 
About 25 Long Beach firefighters responded, Kemins said. Photos from the scene show Point Lookout-Lido fire department and Long Beach police also on hand.
It was not immediately clear why the swimmers got into trouble, whether they got caught in a rip current or if they were swimming in a localized "bad spot," Lieberman said. 
Authorities believe the swimmers did not all know each other but coincidentally ran into trouble around the same time.
Kemins said a total of four people were taken to the hospital. Three had swallowed too much water and the fourth sustained cuts after being pushed onto the jetty by waves, the fire commissioner said.
Lieberman said the boy and a man were "not in good shape" and needed oxygen masks but were breathing on their own. Their conditions could not be immediately obtained Friday night.
"If people heed the warnings and follow the rules, there wouldn't need to be a rescue," Kemins said. "People should not be swimming when lifeguards are off duty. They're not only endangering their own lifes, they're endangering the people who have to respond to it and resc

Panel: Don't dismiss LI reservist

Full text: A military tribunal has ruled that a major in the U.S. Marine Corps who had been attached to a Garden City reserve unit should not be kicked out of the naval service despite using his personal email to send classified information to his unit in Afghanistan years ago.
A three-judge panel found in July that Jason Brezler's actions did not "warrant Major Brezler's separation from the naval service...and recommends closing the case," according to a written decision.
Brezler, who is also a member of the FDNY, had argued that when the Marine Board of Inquiry recommended his dismissal in 2013, it did so in retaliation after Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) inquired into the U.S. Naval Academy graduate's treatment.
The classified email Brezler sent from Oklahoma - after coming back to the United States - to his former base in Afghanistan involved what he said was the sordid history of an Afghan official, court papers show.  A teenage boy with the official eventually shot and killed three Marines on the base, including Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. of Oceanside.
The panel did find that Brezler's actions did not "properly discharge the duties expected of an officer of his grade and experience," and that he "wrongfully" removed "electronic documents and files classified as 'Secret' from official premises."
Corps spokesman Maj. Roger Hollenbeck said the tribunal's recommendation is being passed on to the Office of the Secretary of the Navy, who will make the final determination on his status.
Hollenbeck said Brezler is now in the Individual Ready Reserve, meaning he is on standby status and not attached to any unit until the outcome of the case.
Brezler, who lives in Brooklyn and is in his 40s,  said he loves the corps. "I am grateful beyond words for the opportunity to once again serve as a United State Marine," Brezler said in a statement. "I can't wait to contribute again."
Michael Bowe, an attorney representing Brezler, said his client has fought for seven years to get back to the reserves.
"This was the right result from a panel of senior Marine Corps officers, all of whom came up to him after and expressed their support," Bowe said.
King hailed the panel's decision and recommendation. "It was a terrible injustice, and finally justice is being done," King said.
It is not clear when the secretary of the Navy will make a decision on the panel's recomme

Service medal for 9/11 hero

Full text: Luis Alvarez, the ex-cop who spent his dying days helping get federal health benefits extended for first responders also sickened at Ground Zero, was posthumously awarded on Wednesday New York State's public service medal.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo gave the award to Alvarez's widow, Alaine, and two of his three sons, David and Tyler, at a memorial luncheon to mark the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. In the years after 2001, insidious particles unleashed into the Ground Zero air would sicken more than 10,000 others, including Alvarez, who retired from the NYPD in 2010.
In June, Alvarez gave gripping testimony at a televised House Judiciary subcommittee hearing about the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund amid congressional resistance to extend it.
"What did Detective Alvarez do? He went down to Washington, literally in his last days, and he looked the Congress of the United States in the eye and he spoke the truth from his heart," Cuomo said. "And what he said was simple but powerful: He said put your damn politics aside." 
Alvarez's testimony came just before he died at 53 of colorectal and liver cancer tied to his work at Ground Zero. Alvarez, of Oceanside, had delivered his testimony beside comedian/activist Jon Stewart, then, within days, went into hospice care in Rockville Centre.
Congress passed the legislation, which continues until about 2090, and President Donald Trump signed it. Some Republicans had opposed such funding because of concerns over how to pay for it.
At Wednesday's ceremony, the family stood with Cuomo as he signed into law five bills relating to first-responder benefits.
The bills Cuomo signed help reimburse localities for workers granted sick leave over their 9/11 work; increase the number of clinicians authorized to evaluate workers in the New York City Employee Retirement System applying for disability pensions; extend by five years the deadline for an accidental death benefit claim; expand World Trade Center disability benefits for certain retirees; and grant FDNY retirees diagnosed with certain cancers a presumption that their illness was incurred in the performance of duty.
After the luncheon, with hundreds of motorcyclists at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, Alvarez's widow rode with Cuomo on his motorcycle downtown for an annual Sept. 11 memorial ride he leads.

Bail denied for cop accused in murder plot

Author: Yan, Ellen

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A federal judge denied bail Friday for an NYPD officer accused in a murder-for-hire plot because of "clear and convincing evidence" that she remains a danger to the alleged victims.
U.S. District Court Judge Sandra Feuerstein noted Valerie Cincinelli's "lack of impulse control and remorse and her defensiveness" in a psychological evaluation and wrote that she had also been accused of destroying evidence - two iPhones - around the time of her arrest in May on charges of trying to kill her estranged husband and her boyfriend's teenage daughter.
Cincinelli, 35, of Oceanside, has been held without bail after pleading not guilty to two counts of murder for hire and one count of obstruction of justice.
At the time of her arrest, the 12-year NYPD veteran had been on a modified assignment without a gun for two years because of domestic incidents, an NYPD spokesman said then.
"The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that defendant poses a danger to the safety of the allegedly intended victims and the community, particularly in light of the serious risk that defendant would attempt to obstruct justice, as evidenced by her alleged conduct in destroying and/or attempting to destroy evidence prior to her arrest and her disobedience of court directives while in custody," the judge wrote.
Prosecutors said the veteran officer wanted to kill her husband because he would get part of her police pension in a divorce and argued that she was jealous of her boyfriend's relationship with his teenage daughter. Government recordings caught her talking about the plot, including her bank withdrawal of $7,000 pay to the "hit man," records show. The boyfriend reported Cincinelli to authorities and became an informant, according to court papers.
Cincinelli's attorney, James Kousouros of Manhattan, did not immediately return a call Friday.
During a bail hearing in June, Kousouros had argued that a large bail would ensure Cincinelli's return for court appearances and said her cellphone texts and other communications were being misinterpreted. Cincinelli and her husband were on the verge of a divorce agreement, the attorney said, and Cincinelli was angry with her boyfriend because he owed her $15,000 but was buying luxury goods for his daughter.
In her decision, Feuerstein acknowledged that standards favor setting bail for a defendant except when lives may be in danger. She ruled that Kousouros' bail offer did not address protection for the husband and boyfriend's daughter and the possibility that she would destroy other evidence.
The judge said she was more swayed by the government's points and took into account Cincinelli's history.

drinks | Father and son open bigger café for Italian espresso, gelato

Full text: A recent visitor to Italy can return home filled with complaints. "How can they call this carbonara?" might be one. Or, a deep grimace while sipping a Starbucks espresso. When it comes to gelato - compared to the cloudlike stuff they ate every day on the streets of Rome, they may be at a loss for words.
Vincent Arena and his father, Francesco, were familiar with such grievances, especially as they pertained to espresso. The elder Arena had moved from Calabria to the United States as a child, and later, spent years tracking down iconic Italian food and drink to import. A few years ago, he opened an Island Park café with his son, Tazzetto, to sell Italian-roasted coffee beans and the equipment for making it at home.
The espresso comes from a family the Arenas know in Italy who have won awards for their slow-roasted beans, sourced from various regions before being blended. "They've been roasting for three generations, and it's a medium roast with a really rich crema," said Vincent Arena, 24, referring to the foam that froths across fresh-brewed espresso.
Earlier this year, the Arena closed their first café and opened a larger one in Rockville Centre. It's a sleek, modern, sun-splashed place where you can order espresso, cappuccino, and their brethren at the counter  - plus pastries, croissants, panini and pizzas, mostly imported from Italy - and kick back with a view of one of Rockville Centre's busiest corners.
Of supreme importance to many, though, might be Tazzetto's gelato. Here, the creamy stuff is made in small batches on Italian gelato equipment, with virgin ingredients such as raw pistachios and hazelnuts. "We brought in a gelato chef from Italy," Arena said, to train the staff, and claims Tazzetto's gelato is as good as any you'll find in Italy. The cafe keeps six or so flavors on stock, including a pumpkin spice gelato currently in rotation.
In an unusual twist, Arena (a trained engineer) and his dad are so committed to reducing their carbon footprint that they take spent coffee grounds home to spread in the garden. When they open a second spot in Oceanside by late October - in a former Starbucks - that compost will probably double.

Gillen seeks audit of buildings dept

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen is calling for an audit of the town building department to identify ways to reduce long wait times for permits and to make property information more readily available to residents and business owners.
Gillen said Wednesday that the audit is intended in large part to deal with lingering issues town homeowners face in repairing damage caused by superstorm Sandy in 2012.
Gillen said she will propose hiring FTI Consulting of Manhattan to conduct the audit. The $155,000 contract requires the approval of the town board.
Councilman Anthony D'Esposito said the board is "eager to consider any proposal that can help increase governmental efficiency."
Building Department Commissioner John Rottkamp did not respond to a request for comment.
The department processed about 9,000 building permit applications and 7,000 plumbing permit applications in 2018, Gillen said.
The high volume can mean long wait times for applicants.
Last year, the town received about 1,400 calls to its help line over issues in the building department, she said.
"That's a staggering number," she said. "We believe that bringing in this consultant will greatly improve operations in the building department."
A key issue the audit would examine  concerns residents who purchased Sandy-damaged homes, only to realize later that the damaged structures required sometimes extensive improvements to bring them up to code.
In the aftermath of the storm, some 13,000 homes received preliminary damage assessments from the town, Gillen said. But the town has received only about 4,400 permits to repair or raise storm-struck homes, meaning thousands may still require costly fixes.
In many cases, residents don't realize that they've purchased such a home until they apply for permits to carry out unrelated improvements, she said.
Mike Cascio, a general contractor whose  Oceanside home was damaged in Sandy, said he's heard "horror stories" about residents still struggling to fix up homes battered by the storm.
"There are still many out there . . . that don't know the status of their homes," he said. "This is a problem that's going to continue to impact our entire community."
Town officials said FTI Consulting was selected through a competitive bidding process by a committee that included representatives of the supervisor's and town attorney's offices and the building and purchasing departments. Town spokesman Mike Fricchione said no representatives of the town board were on the committee.
Gillen said the contract for the audit consultant will come up for a vote at an upcoming town bo

MSK Nassau set to open at Hub in April

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Memorial Sloan Kettering this week said MSK Nassau, its $180 million, 114,000-square-foot cancer facility at the Hub in Uniondale, will open to patients in April.
The cancer center was originally slated to open in September but was completed ahead of schedule. Construction began in January 2017.
The Manhattan-based cancer care system said up to 220 employees will work at MSK Nassau, which will have more than 20 doctors covering disciplines such as medical and radiation oncology, radiology and surgery.
The project was originally estimated to cost close to $140 million but was increased, in part, to accommodate enhanced clinical equipment and health care information technology. The facility has 38 exam rooms, 26 private infusion spaces and a rapid-response laboratory.
A 450-spot, five-story parking garage at MSK Nassau is also set to open in April.
"To have all these cancer services in one place, without space limitations, is something we are very grateful for," said Dr. Pamela Drullinsky, a medical oncologist and the medical site director for MSK Nassau.
While surgeries will still take place at Sloan Kettering's main hospital in Manhattan, most pre- and post-surgical procedures can occur in Nassau County, she added.
Services addressing almost every aspect of cancer care will be available at MSK Nassau, the health system said, including chemotherapy; medical oncology; radiation therapy; radiology, imaging and screening services; personalized medicine; access to clinical trials; genetic testing; support counseling; and follow-up care.
Memorial Sloan Kettering expects to close its Rockville Centre facility at Mercy Medical Center once the new location is open. That location is about 27,000 square feet of space.
Drullinsky said about 20 percent of Memorial Sloan Kettering patients at its Manhattan flagship are from Long Island, and the larger local facility will allow many of them to get more of their care closer to home.
The health system predicted MSK Nassau would see 20,500 clinical visits in 2019. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering isn't the only health system expanding on Long Island.
Stony Brook Medicine recently opened a 240,000-square-foot cancer center on Stony Brook University's East Campus, while Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip said it plans to open a cancer center at its hospital later this year.
New Hyde Park-based Northwell Health earlier this year said it had revamped the clinical leadership in its cancer care unit. The health system appointed three deputy physicians-in-chief to lead medical, surgical and radiation oncology across the 23-hospital health system.
South Nassau Communities Hospital, part of the Mount Sinai Health System, recently said it received a $1.75 million gift that will be put toward opening a cancer center at its main campus in Oceanside. 
The new cancer center could open in three to five years, said Dr. Rajiv Datta, chairman of the department of surgery and director of cancer services at South Nassau. 
There were 18,000 new cases of cancer per year on Long Island, on average, from 2011 through 2015, according to the most recent data available from the

DROPS: THE MANY GORGEOUS SHADES OF P!NK

Abstract: None available.

Full text: P!NK "Hurts 2B Human" BOTTOM LINE Building a superstar pop lane that's all her own.
P!nk really can do it all.
She can rock out. She can rap. She can sing a gorgeous ballad while spinning on a trapeze. And somehow she boldly does it without compromising her distinctive point of view, musically and literally.
So maybe it should be no surprise that her eighth studio album "Hurts 2B Human" (RCA) is all over the musical map, as she collaborates with R&B star Khalid, rocker Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons, and outlaw country savior Chis Stapleton, as well as "Chandelier"-swinger Sia and pop hitmaker Max Martin. But make no mistake, it's all P!nk.
"Can we pretend that we both like the president?" she asks, with a chuckle, in the EDM banger "Can We Pretend," her collaboration with Cash Cash that is one of the album's strongest contenders for a hit. "Can we pretend that I really like your shoes?" Throughout the album, P!nk makes references to a tumultuous world, but rather than letting it get her down, she sings about moving through it with help. In "Walk Me Home," one of two songs she co-wrote with Oceanside native Scott Harris, she modernizes the unifying folk anthems of Mumford and Sons or The Lumineers to create a call for support. "Say you'll stay with me tonight," she sings in that full, powerful voice that has become her trademark. " 'Cause there is so much wrong going on outside."
The poignant ballad "Love Me Anyway," her collaboration with Stapleton, could stand as one of the year's best songs - like her underrated duet with Nate Ruess, "Just Give Me a Reason." Not only do their voices fit together beautifully, as P!nk uses the sweeter part of her register to balance Stapleton's gruffness, but they build a stunning, memorable moment of vulnerability.
It's one more element on "Hurts 2B Human" that P!nk makes work on her terms, resulting in a genre-spanning triumph.

Full text: To save waterways and aquifer, use less salt
Long Island and state highway departments should take steps to protect our water supply by reducing the tons of salt they pour on our roads to melt ice and snow.
Many substances that dissolve in water will lower the freezing temperature of ice on the roads. Several U.S. and Canadian municipalities have used beet juice with salt. The mixture is less toxic and less corrosive to vehicles. It can allow crews to use less salt.

Stop the personal attacks on Facebook
Facebook started as a fun way to connect with people, but it has turned into a political war zone between Republicans and Democrats. I've seen people I've "friended" call others with whom they disagree stupid or uneducated. The hateful name-calling is out of control. It hurts and divides people. What ever happened to "Live and let live"?
On Facebook, keep it friendly and refrain from personal attacks. Post your opinions if you must, but don't attack friends and family.
I consider myself one of the "silent majority." I'm not registered as Republican, Democrat or Liberal, but I vote for candidates who share my values, people I think will get the job done.
Life goes on. I work hard, pay my bills and pray for world peace. Maybe peace in the world is asking for too much. How about starting with peace on Facebook?

Unfeeling treatment in Suffolk traffic court
I got an $80 red-light camera ticket earlier this year while I was following my son's car to an unfamiliar restaurant in the Bay Shore area. I went to the Suffolk County traffic court in Hauppauge, hoping I could explain that I proceeded as the light was turning red because I didn't want to get lost. I thought I would be dealing with a human in the courtroom - but the reality was a harsh awakening.
At the agency, each person, when called up, told stories of going over a white line or through a short yellow light.
The judge and another official were like robots. There was no human understanding or leeway for people who had made honest mistakes. An older couple explained they had never received a ticket before. They were clearly humiliated. The judge explained that getting a ticket didn't make them bad people - and wouldn't result in points on their licenses.
"This is just a money grabber," another driver said as I nodded in agreement.
I just paid and left. It was taking up my valuable time.

Deal keeps hospital in insurer's network

Full text: Empire BlueCross BlueShield and South Nassau Communities Hospital have reached a contract that will keep the hospital, along with doctors in its system, in the insurer's network, the hospital said on Friday.
Financial terms of the 30-month deal were not disclosed.
"We are thankful for the support and patience we received throughout the negotiations from our patients, staff members and civic, elected and business leaders," the hospital said in a statement.
A representative for Empire BlueCross BlueShield confirmed that an agreement had been reached.
The contract between the Oceanside-based hospital and Empire BlueCross expired on May 1. If a deal had not been reached after a 60-day cooling-off period, Empire BlueCross patients receiving nonemergency care beginning July 1 would have been forced to find alternative means of care or pay out-of-network prices.
South Nassau said earlier this month that it reached deals with BlueCross competitors Cigna and UnitedHealthcare that provide it with "adequate reimbursement for the hospital's services. BlueCross refuses to do so."
The BlueCross deal disclosed Friday takes a weight off the shoulders of local patients, said State Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach).
"People don't always realize how important access is until it gets threatened," Kaminsky said. "I spoke to a lot of people who have many ailments who couldn't imagine losing this access, so this is a wonderful turn of events."
South Nassau is in the process of joining the much larger Mount Sinai Health System, but final approval on that deal won't take place until later this year, so South Nassau negotiated a stand-alone deal with BlueCross.
Hospitals regionally and nationally have joined larger health systems, in part, because being part of a larger network gives them stronger negotiating power. In the last year locally, John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson joined Northwell Health, while Southampton Hospital joined Stony Brook Medicine.
Experts say insurers and hospitals have been taking tougher negotiating stands as profit margins get thinner in both industries.
"But in the end, the hospital and the health insurer need each other, so after the threatening letters, and a long negotiation, they figure it out," Paul Keckley, a health care analyst in Washington, D.C., and Nashville, said earlier this month.

Full text: JUAN C. VIDES
DEMOCRATIC
BACKGROUND: Vides, 41, of Oceanside, is a computer programmer. who�owns and operates a web design and internet marketing business. �Born in El Salvador, he was brought to the United States by his parents at age 4. He attended Long Beach public schools and is a 1995 graduate of Long Beach High School. Vides earned an associate's degree in liberal arts from Nassau Community College, and a B.S.�degree in computer programming from Farmingdale State College. He served from 2012 to 2018 on the board of the Long Island chapter of the American Heart Association, and from 2016 to 2018 on the board of directors of Bethpage Federal Credit Union. He also served on the board of the Long Island Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Vides is married.
ISSUES: Vides said his first run for public office is partly in response to recent high-profile government corruption scandals. "People are frustrated with politics and frustrated with their leaders, and a lot of empty promises," Vides said. "We have a lot of representatives walking out of courthouses." Vides said he has given up prestigious positions to run for the Assembly.� "I served on two boards and on the boards of chambers of commerce, but I am willing to give everything up to become a public servant," Vides said. He said if elected he would attempt to "restore faith and trust" in a system he takes pride in being a part of. "I count my blessings that I am in this country every day," Vides said. �He said, however, that like many Americans, he has been angered by a federal immigration policy that has separated children from their parents. "We have a responsibility to take care of the kids," he said. �

LONG ISLAND: SHIRLEY DAY SMITH, LONGTIME EMPLOYEE AT NY RACING

Full text: On a wall in Aqueduct Racetrack's press box is a snapshot of a woman smiling as she raises a glass in a toast. Shirley Day Smith worked for the New York Racing Association and its predecessors for more than 60 years, starting when thoroughbred racing, along with baseball and boxing, was among the big three of American sports.
Because she retired in 1995 after 40 years with NYRA, many who see that old photo never knew Smith. She served as an administrative assistant, mainly dealing with the media, back when all-time greats Red Smith, Joe Hirsch and Bill Nack chronicled racing.
Smith, 99, of Lido Beach, died Thursday after a brief illness at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, her longtime friend Paula Rodenas said. Among the NYRA publicity directors Smith worked for were Pat O'Brien, Pat Lynch, Sam Kanchuger, Chris Scherf, Steve Schwartz and Glen Mathes, said Bob Curran Jr., a retired Jockey Club communications director and a former NYRA colleague who released a statement on her death.
"Shirley was loved by everybody," Mathes told Curran. "And I'd venture to say she helped more people than anyone in the history of horse racing. That was certainly true when it came to members of the media. She was a great worker and an even better person."
Her career spanned the World War II era to the early days of the internet. Smith was on the job in October 1991 when there was a triple dead heat for win at Belmont Park.
"Shirley said, 'We're going to need a lot of copies of that photo-finish picture because I remember we did the last time it happened,' " Mathes said. "The last time it had happened was 47 years earlier, in the 1944 Carter Handicap."
Smith helped run the New York Turf Writers Association, and her influence extended beyond her hometown. The New York City native was honored as a Kentucky Colonel by that state, and in 2001 she received the Joe Palmer Award for meritorious service to racing from the National Turf Writers Association.
For Rodenas, a freelance writer from Merrick, Smith was a kindly mentor. "I was an equestrian journalist who had never covered racing," Rodenas said. "When I started doing that, she was very helpful. She treated everybody like family."
Smith, who was married when she was young, had no children, Rodenas said.
There will be a funeral Mass at 10 a.m. Monday at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Point Lookout, with burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx.

Full text: Big questions await George W. Bush
George W. Bush will discuss challenges the United States is facing in the 21st century on Thursday during an interview at LIU Post in Brookville .
Isn't this the same president behind the worst foreign policy disaster since Vietnam, the unecessary invasion of Iraq, and who presided over the greatest economic meltdown since the Great Depression?
He should pay the audience to listen to him.
John Boughal, Bayport
Party leader supports NY Senate candidate
Thanks for mentioning me in your endorsement of Louis D'Amaro for State Senate .
Just to correct your main pronouncement that I do "not support D'Amaro's candidacy," I offer the following:
I endorsed Lou's candidacy, and he has used my name in support of his candidacy throughout the campaign.
In addition, I hosted a fundraiser for him, personally collected more than 300 signatures for him on his Democratic nominating petition, made a personal donation of $500 to his campaign and am working my election district in North Babylon for him and the other Democratic candidates this year.
Rich Schaffer, North Babylon
Editor's note: The writer is chairman of the Suffolk County Democratic Party.
Wang struggled to deal with LI politicians
Thanks for putting Charles Wang on the front page and writing such a nice article .
He was too good, too smart, too fair and too honest for Nassau County. He was unable to deal with the inept, entrenched, self-serving, historically dishonest Nassau County powers that be.
It was our loss then, and it is our loss now. Thank you, Charles Wang, for trying.
Tommy Gregoretti, Oceanside
Cut back on Nassau's take-home fleet
The comptroller's audit revealing that Nassau County has failed to properly monitor 363 take-home cars used by workers has made residents aware of a problem that needs correcting . Nassau is always lacking funds to balance its budget. Well, here's an area where it can cut costs for licensing, maintenance, fuel and insurance. It's time to curtail these "free" rides and take the money used for them to lower our budget.

Median price: $450G: Home prices on LI hit record high as sales dip in number

Full text: Median home sale prices on Long Island have hit a record high as overall transactions and the number of homes for sale continue to decline.
The median home price on the Island - excluding the North Fork and the Hamptons - was $450,000 in the July-to-September period, brokerage Douglas Elliman and appraisal company Miller Samuel are due to report Thursday. The 5.9 percent increase in median home prices from a year earlier marks a record high in the 16 years Douglas Elliman has tracked such data, the brokerage said.
The number of home sales closed in that period declined 2.6 percent to 8,304, and overall inventory fell 9.1 percent to 11,650 from 12,818 in the year earlier period.
"What we've been seeing for about four years has been very robust price growth and essentially a chronic lack of inventory," said Jonathan J. Miller, president and chief executive of Miller Samuel.
While median prices hit a record, Miller noted that price increases alone are not the primary factor to look at when determining the health of the market. Low inventory, combined with rising mortgage rates and economic uncertainty, have contributed to fewer overall transactions.
"It's been a couple years in the works, and I think rising mortgage rates have helped accelerate it," he said.
The Hamptons saw a median sale price increase of 8.4 percent, rising to $965,000 from $890,000.
The median home price on the North Fork jumped to $619,000 from $550,000 a year earlier, representing a 12.5 percent increase.
The median sales price for the luxury market - homes representing the top 10 percent of sale prices - dipped to $1.2 million, down 1 percent from last year.
"We have the luxury market where there's downward pressure on pricing," said Ann Conroy, president of Douglas Elliman's Long Island Division. "With the entry market, there's a lack of inventory and there's many more buyers than sellers."
Both Conroy and Miller said that the pattern of rising prices will begin to level off as affordability begins to play a larger role. 
"The rate of price growth of the last four or five years doesn't seem to be sustainable," Miller said. "You can't continue at 5 or 6 percent annual growth when wages aren't rising anywhere near that and credit conditions, from a historical context, are tighter than the

Christoforou's goal historic

Full text: Port Washington was the second-to-last team in the Nassau AA playoffs, but Savvas Christoforou and the Vikings are now the last team standing.
Christoforou scored the lone goal of the game in No. 8 Port Washington's victory over No. 3 Massapequa Wednesday evening in the county championship at Mitchel Field, earning the first county title in the boys soccer program's history.
Port Washington will play either Newfield or Whitman for the Long Island title on Sunday at Diamond in the Pines in Coram.
"No one really believed in us, but we just kept winning and winning," Christoforou said. "I knew from the start of the year that we were strong-minded and going to capitalize on people doubting us. We wanted to make a name for Port Washington."
Christoforou scored the winner with just under 35 minutes left in the match when he found space inside the penalty area and fired home with a left-footed shot.
"Massapequa is superb in every aspect of the game and I knew they were going to play hard," Vikings coach Don Fish said. "We put it together, supported each other and the culture of this group really helped produce wins."
Port Washington (8-5) hardly had an easy route to the final, as they had to win a play-in against Oceanside for the right to face top-seeded Syosset. The Vikings edged the Braves in overtime thanks to a goal from Douglas Barerra Yanes and beat No. 5 Farmingdale in a semifinal on Friday. Their win Wednesday dropped Massapequa to 9-2-4.
"We played the most games, since we were the only team with a play-in game," Christoforou said. "Each one has been a battle. Respect to every team we played. We grew in confidence and so did our whole school. The first game, it was just our parents. Now we have two school buses full of students here."
"We got better with every game," midfielder Jack Fridman. "This is something I've been waiting for and I felt it coming."
Fridman added there were nerves early on in the match, but the Vikings soon settled into it and played their usual game.
"It was the first time any of us have played in a game this big," he said. "We came out a little shaky but was once we gained our confidence, we knew it was ours."

NASA Engineer who helped build Mars rovers talks to LI kids

Full text: We walked inside the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City and looked around. We saw airplanes and models of aircrafts. We walked through the big hall right near the doorway of the presentation room where Kobie Boykins would be. We were eager to meet Kobie, a NASA engineer.
Kobie Boykins is a NASA engineer who helped to build the sister Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. He also helped design the rover Curiosity, which is still exploring to this day. Kobie will be designing many parts of the new 2020 rover.
In our opinion Kobie Boykins has a very enthusiastic personality. He does not take being famous for granted. What we mean by that is he acts like a normal person even though he has accomplished so many things.
We got to see Kobie present pictures about his rovers and pictures of Mars. He talked about the team's newest rover, the Mars 2020. We asked him if the new 2020 rover was the most complicated one he and his team will be making or designing. He said as far as the mobility system, no, but the science is so much more advanced and harder than anything else he and his team have designed and engineered. This means that most of the engineering portion will be the same but the science will be a lot more advanced and able to get more accurate results on rock tests.
He presented for an hour, but we had to leave early to get ready for the interview. When Kobe came out everyone watched him. Some people brought him into the room where we would interview him. Cameras followed him and we watched as he spoke.
We began the interview by asking him if he felt under a lot of pressure when he builds spaceships and rovers. He told us that he does because of the pressure he puts on himself. He said that the spacecraft is not what is putting you in that position, you just want to make it perfect.
Kobie told us that his favorite subject as a kid was physics because he said that it was mostly hands-on. He was a visual learner so he really liked anything that he could touch and play with.
We learned that Kobie loves to play with his two kids in his spare time, and when he was younger, and even now, he likes to build with Legos. As he got older, he liked to make drones. As you can tell, he always loved to build in his free time.
We had a blast interviewing Kobie Boykins. It was such a great experience for us. Kobie was so nice to us and we learned so much about him.

Run aims to raise awareness of post-birth depression: More than 600 runners turned out for the Postpartum Resource Center of New York's annual 5k/10k, which raised $50,000 and brought attention to perinatal mood and anxiety disorders

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Vanessa Barisano was pregnant nearly 20 years ago, she knew something didn't feel right.
She had trouble sleeping and felt anxious all the time, but her doctors told her that was normal. Barisano, now 47, was right - she was struggling with depression and she needed help. That's when she found the Postpartum Resource Center of New York, a community of women helping other women through mental health support.
"I immediately felt relief and a sense of 'I'm going to be OK, there are people paying attention,' " Barisano, of Roslyn, said Saturday at the center's annual Sounds of Silence 5k/10k Run.
More than 600 people turned out for the center's 10th run, raising $50,000 and awareness of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. For survivors like Barisano, it was a chance to embrace their community and a learning experience for their supporters.
Runners and walkers began gathering at 8 a.m. to register, pick up T-shirts and have breakfast. Organizers kicked off the event with raffles, group yoga stretches and a resource fair at Field 5 at Jones Beach.
The cold gray weather didn't deter runners, who stayed warm with sweatshirts and jackets before taking off just after 9 a.m.
"It's important to raise awareness with Mother's Day coming up," said Katie Pearlman, 38, of Oceanside, who brought her son Andy, 8, for the 5k.
One in 10 pregnant women will experience depression or anxiety, said Sonia Murdock, the center's executive director and co-founder, and these conditions are treatable if families and doctors know what to look for. The race is a chance to reach out to the community as runners register and seek donations.
"This is a celebration of moms, we want to highlight the strength of moms," Murdock said.
Patricia Beaumont, co-chair of the race, said she hoped attendees walked away with a greater understanding of how to help new mothers. The warning signs, like fatigue, lack of interest, personality changes and feelings of anxiety, aren't always obvious and some women may be afraid to speak up, so loved ones and doctors need to make a point to ask directly.
"You're sitting in that bed holding that baby with a fake smile," Beaumont said. " . . . when I became a mom, they gave me a slip of paper in the hospital that said 'You can get help,' but that's not enough. You need face-to-face contact."
The West Islip center offers resources and trainings, and many women who find help there return to volunteer. Erin Mascaro and her sister Lisa Reilly organized the first walk in 2008 after Reilly's own experience with depression. Reilly died in 2014.
"My sister wanted to pay it forward," said Mascaro, race director. "The 'Super Mom' our society has created is unrealistic. This is real motherhood and sometimes you need real help."

Aidan Cooney helps send Massapequa to county finals: Makes game-saving catch at wall, then scores winning run on alert baserunning play as Chiefs clinch spot in Class AA county final

Full text: Aidan Cooney can say firsthand that a couple of feet can be the difference between a win and a loss.
Cooney made game-winning and game-saving plays in No. 4 Massapequa's 5-4 win over No. 2 Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK on Wednesday, leading the host Chiefs in Game 2 of the Nassau Class AA baseball semifinals.
With the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the seventh, Cooney, standing on third after he reached on a blooper to center, broke for home on an alert baserunning play after the pitch got away. Cooney slid headfirst and beat the throw, sending Massapequa to the county finals against No. 1 Oceanside.
"It's my job at third," Cooney said. "It's always my job to be ready ."
Had it not been for his glove in the top of the seventh, Massapequa might not have advanced. Two batters after Mike Moreno made a diving catch in front of the warning track in left-centerfield, Cooney tracked Michael Rothstein's blast just in front of the 370-foot marker in center.
Cooney left his feet and extended his glove, hauling in a shot that sent everyone in attendance to their feet.
"That's 368," Cooney said. "Two feet away."
Rothstein homered in the top of the fifth inning for a 3-0 Plainview lead in support of starter Mark Faello, a Hofstra commit. But Massapequa (17-6) capitalized on a defensive miscue in the infield in the bottom of the fifth, and pinch-hitter Dan Wolf eventually provided the big hit with a two-run single that gave Massapequa a 4-3 lead.
Dan Meaney relieved Chiefs starter Bobby Conlon after five innings but left with a 2-and-0 count on Ryan Saltzman and Jason Pollack standing on second base. Ethan Schorr ripped the first pitch he saw into right-center, scoring Pollack and tying the game for Plainview (16-8).
Winning pitcher Kenny Galvin then watched Moreno and Cooney keep his pitching line unblemished in the seventh inning.
"It's funny, we worked on going to the fence our last practice," Massapequa coach Tom Sheedy said. "I was apologizing to Aidan, who's just a fabulous defensive outfielder, that when the series was over, we were going to spend some more time on that."
Cooney seems to be just fine.

Rutgers Cup: Garden City named Nassau's top team after second straight 12-0 season: School earned 134 points and 31 first-place votes in voting done by Nassau coaches

Full text: It's back-to-back and a pick-6 for Garden City.
The Trojans earned the Rutgers Cup as Nassau County's most outstanding football team for the second year in a row and sixth time overall after a second straight 12-0 season that was capped with a 24-6 victory over North Babylon in the Long Island Class II championship game.
Coached by Dave Ettinger for a third straight season, Garden City earned 134 points and 31 first-place votes in voting done by county coaches. Oceanside (11-1) was second with 112 points and 17 first-place votes. Seaford (10-2), which won the Long Island Class IV title in coach Rob Perpall's final game, was third with 52 points and five first-place votes. The announcement was made Wednesday night at the Nassau football awards dinner in Woodbury.
Garden City was in a class by itself all season in extending its Long Island-best current winning streak to 24 straight. The team featured a quick, gang-tackling defense led by end/linebacker Andrew DeSantis and tackle Mike Liberopoulos that allowed only six points per game with three shutouts.
Trevor Yeboah-Kodie had a breakout junior season with 1,264 yards and 26 rushing touchdowns. He was exceptional in the playoffs. He scored three touchdowns and rushed for 203 yards in the county final against Mepham, including a 91-yard scoring run. In the LIC, Yeboah-Kodie iced the game in the fourth quarter with a spectacular 92-yard interception return for a touchdown.
The Trojans' closest game, in terms of scoring margin, was their 35-14 win over Calhoun in the county semifinals. GC's lowest scoring total was 27 points against MacArthur in Week 2.
In the LIC, DeSantis, who was limited to mostly playing defense after a Week 2 injury, scored on a 38-yard run and caught a 60-yard TD pass. "I was happy to help my team win," he said. "It was amazing."
So was the season.

Jeremy Ruckert adds to trophy case with NY State Player of Year award: Lindenhurst's do-everything player dominated on offense, defense and in the kicking game

Full text: Jeremy Ruckert grabbed another one.
The Lindenhurst wide receiver headed to Ohio State added another honor to his collection of prestigious awards when he was named the New York State Gatorade Player of the Year on Monday night.
Ruckert, who shared the 58th Carl A. Hansen Award as Suffolk's top player, also nabbed the Jets Receiver award, Division I MVP and led Lindenhurst to the school's first Long Island Class I title over Oceanside.
The four-year starter put up impressive statistics during his career, which included two Suffolk I championships. He was also selected to play in the 2018 U.S. Army All American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas, on Jan. 6.
"Jeremy Ruckert is one of the best players I've ever coached against," said Paul Longo, the head coach at William Floyd for the past 23 years. "He's been dominant in all three aspects of the game. From the kicking game to defense to offense. I don't think I've ever faced that before. He has an impact on every play. I think he'll be playing on Sunday afternoons one day."
Ruckert, at 6-6, 237 pounds, is regarded by many as one of Long Island's all-time greats. He made 61 catches for 1,094 yards and 13 touchdowns against defenses that double- and triple-teamed him. He was also a fantastic run blocker as Lindenhurst averaged 38 points per game.
From his hybrid position at defensive end/linebacker, he finished with 61 tackles, including 13 sacks, and two interceptions for a unit that yielded only eight points per game. The multi-dimensional, three-time All-Long Island selection drilled 48 of 50 extra points, six field goals and had 42 touchbacks on kickoffs.
For his career, Ruckert had 222 receptions for 3,133 yards and 37 receiving touchdowns.
It was the second year in a row that a Long Island player earned the Gatorade Award. Sayville quarterback Jack Coan, who now plays at Wisconsin, was the 2016 recipient.
"I'm looking forward to playing against Jack next year," Ruckert said of his good friend.

Ruckert, who shared the 58th Carl A. Hansen Award as Suffolk's top player, also nabbed the Jets Receiver award, Division I MVP and led Lindenhurst to the school's first Long Island Class I title over Oceanside.
The four-year starter put up impressive statistics during his career, which included two Suffolk I championships. He was also selected to play in the 2018 U.S. Army All American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas, on Jan. 6.
"Jeremy Ruckert is one of the best players I've ever coached against," said Paul Longo, the head coach at William Floyd for the past 23 years. "He's been dominant in all three aspects of the game. From the kicking game to defense to offense. I don't think I've ever faced that before. He has an impact on every play. I think he'll be playing on Sunday afternoons one day."
Ruckert, at 6-6, 237 pounds, is regarded by many as one of Long Island's all-time greats. He made 61 catches for 1,094 yards and 13 touchdowns against defenses that double- and triple-teamed him. He was also a fantastic run blocker as Lindenhurst averaged 38 points per game.
From his hybrid position at defensive end/linebacker, he finished with 61 tackles, including 13 sacks, and two interceptions for a unit that yielded only eight points per game. The multi-dimensional, three-time All-Long Island selection drilled 48 of 50 extra points, six field goals and had 42 touchbacks on kickoffs.
For his career, Ruckert had 222 receptions for 3,133 yards and 37 receiving touchdowns.
It was the second year in a row that a Long Island player earned the Gatorade Award. Sayville quarterback Jack Coan, who now plays at Wisconsin, was the 2016 recipient.
"I'm looking forward to playing against Jack next year," Ruckert said of his good friend.

Northwell Health adds Mather Hospital to its health system: The final agreement will take effect in January, Northwell CEO Michael Dowling says. No layoffs are anticipated

Abstract: None available.

Full text: John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson has agreed to join the Northwell Health system.
The hospital, which will now be known as Mather Hospital, becomes Northwell's fifth hospital in Suffolk County.
Mather signed a letter of intent to join Northwell in July. At that time, officials said they would work to develop a final agreement, including gaining the approval of the boards of directors at the hospital and at Northwell. The final agreement will be signed on Thursday and takes effect in January.
Northwell doesn't expect to make major changes at Mather immediately, said Michael J. Dowling, president and chief executive of the New Hyde Park-based health system.
"We don't want to disrupt something that's going well," Dowling said in an interview earlier this month. "We will spend 12 months identifying what our priorities should be."
Mather has 12,000 inpatients and 41,000 emergency room cases each year. It has 2,568 employees, according to its website.
Dowling said he didn't anticipate layoffs.
Mather is the first hospital to join the Northwell system since Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead joined in 2016. At Peconic, Northwell established a cardiac catheterization program in the fall and broke ground on a $60 million critical care tower.
Northwell has committed to making a series of clinical and infrastructure investments at Mather, although it didn't specify what the investments would be.
Three other hospitals in the county have joined Northwell's network in the last 23 years: Huntington Hospital in 1994, Southside in Bay Shore in 1996, and South Oaks in Amityville in 2012. Mather is the most recent Long Island hospital to join or affiliate with a larger health system. Southampton Hospital joined the Stony Brook Medicine health system this summer and was renamed Stony Brook Southampton Hospital.
South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside is in talks with the Mount Sinai Health System with the aim of possible affiliation. A South Nassau spokesman said Wednesday those talks are progressing.
With about 63,500 employees, Northwell is the largest private employer in the state. The system operates 23 hospitals, 600 outpatient facilities and has nearly 15,000 affiliated physicians in greater New York. It has about 100 outpatient facilities in Suffolk County.

Home prices spike in Nassau, rise modestly in Suffolk

Author: McDermott, Maura

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]18 Oct 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1951869235?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A scarce supply of homes for sale drove prices up sharply in Nassau County last month and more modestly in Suffolk.
The median price in Nassau for a closed home sale was $511,000 in September, up 9.9 percent from a year earlier, the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island reported Tuesday.
In Suffolk, homes sold for a median price of $360,000, a 3.2 percent increase from the previous September.
A shortage of homes for sale continues to force buyers into bidding wars that boost prices, real estate agents said. There were 12,098 homes listed last month on Long Island, down 12 percent from a year earlier.
If a home is priced appropriately and in decent shape, "it immediately gets sold," said Nick Sakalis, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Syosset. "What's left . . . is the houses that are overpriced, homes that have some type of issue or other homes that are not in a big buyer pool. If it's a high-end home, you just don't have that many buyers looking."
The number of sales fell by 11.5 percent in Nassau and rose by 4.9 percent in Suffolk, compared with the year-ago period. Those trends appear likely to continue, with the number of homes going into contract last month falling annually by 5.7 percent in Nassau and rising year-over-year by 8.1 percent in Suffolk.
Buyers are shifting to Suffolk in search of more affordable options, Sakalis said.
The rising prices have not yet drawn enough sellers into the market to meet demand.
In some cases, homeowners refrain from listing their homes - or pull them off the market - because they do not have enough equity to purchase another home on the Island, said Andy Yakubovsky, manager of Century 21 American Homes in Oceanside.
"We've lost transactions where people have gone into contract and they can't find a house and they have to back out," he said.
Of homes with mortgages on Long Island, 5.5 percent - more than 31,000 - were "underwater" in the second quarter, meaning the home values were lower than the mortgages, according to the most recent report by the California-based data company CoreLogic. Another 1.2 percent had less than 5 percent equity.
What's more, the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in Florida has prompted some Long Islanders to reconsider plans to move to that state, Yakubovsky said. Those homeowners may linger on the Island a little longer while they decide whether to move to North or South Carolina instead, he said.
Even so, he said, "that's going to be a short-term thing . . . eventually, people are going to be moving."

Cuomo: Playground upgrades at Robert Moses, Heckscher state parks

Author: Gralla, Joan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two state parks in Suffolk County will get modern playgrounds with special sections for the disabled and children of different ages, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday.
An "oceanside-themed" playground is planned for Field 5 at Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, Cuomo said. It will feature seahorse and dolphin rockers for children ages 2 to 5, George Gorman, Long Island deputy regional park director, said by email.
The 5- to 12-year-old set will gain "wave climbers," or walls with holes, he said.
At East Islip's Heckscher State Park, Field 6 will be expanded with new "meadow-themed" equipment and a large, central pavilion to offer shade, replacing the gazebo that now stands there, Cuomo said.
The specifics include more open space with flowers and native plants, Gorman said.
That playground is one of the most popular at the park because it's near a picnic area and has water views. On sunny weekends, it can be so crowded that some children are left out, he added.
At the park's Field 1, new swing sets will be added to the playground, along with a safer surface, accessible walkways and seating.
All the improvements should be completed by next summer, Gorman said.
They are among the $12.6 million of playground upgrades Cuomo announced for a dozen state parks around New York.
By 2020, he said, 100 playgrounds at state parks should be updated - or added.
The initiative is in the governor's 10-year plan to invest $900 million in state parks.
"With this investment, we are ensuring our park system remains second to none and I encourage families from near and far to get out and explore all New York has to offer," Cuomo said.

Full text: New York Institute of Technology held its 56th commencement Sunday on the campus in Old Westbury.
Number of graduates
994 bachelor's degrees, 1,730 master's degrees, 312 doctorates
Commencement speaker
NYIT's interim president Rahmat Shoureshi spoke of the challenges graduates will face after leaving the college and how their degrees have uniquely equipped them to succeed in a "world fueled by technology," and to adapt and prepare for the "twists and turns" ahead. "Commencement marks a new beginning, a new life that is about to unfold before you," Shoureshi said. "Beginning today, take everything you have learned at NYIT not just to advance your professional and personal standing, but also, and far more importantly, to improve the lives of others."
Hank Foley, the university's incoming president, looked ahead to the school's future, telling students, "This feels like a very special place, a place that is as diverse as it is innovative. And I can see that by working together as partners, we can achieve even greater levels of success and distinction for NYIT across the globe and into the future."
Student speaker
Alvaro Olmeda talked about the difficulties of leaving his hometown of Porto Alegre, Brazil, to study in the United States. He celebrated the diversity of this year's graduating class, which has students from more than 60 countries. "If I can stand here as a proud, gay Latino man, it is because I found in you, my peers, a community of support, of true friends - of young leaders who believe in a modern world, in advancing through technology, in changing the future," said Olmeda, who graduated with a bachelor's degree in communication arts. "We all leave NYIT with our own set of superpowers."
Graduates
Gary Baxter, 70, master's of communication arts
"It was a unique struggle to acclimate to all this new technology, but I enjoyed every minute of it," said Baxter, 70, a Vietnam veteran from Brooklyn.
Matt Busch, 22, bachelor's in architecture
"I'll be starting a job as a junior architect at a firm in Old Westbury," said Busch, 22, of Islip. "It's what I've always wanted to do."
Christine Lorenzo, 40, advanced diploma in school leadership and technology
"I currently work as a teacher in the Herricks School District and now feel prepared for the next step in my career as an educator," said Lorenzo, 40, of Oceanside.
Greg Desrosiers, 29, master's in electrical and computer engineering
"I started a job about two months ago as a systems engineer. Before that I was a support engineer," said Desrosiers, 29, of Huntington, adding that he decided to earn his master's degree after the birth of his daughter, Gianna.

Yuval Solomon wins his third straight singles title

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK's Yuval Solomon has another jewel for his high school tennis crown.
The reigning state champion won his third consecutive Nassau singles tournament title, 6-0, 6-0 over New Hyde Park's Peter Siozios at Oceanside High School on Sunday.
"I focused on playing my game and being aggressive," Solomon said.
Earlier this season, the senior took his first Nassau loss since first appearing in the singles final as a freshman in 2014. He fell to Neel Rajesh, but the fifth-year player avenged that defeat with a win over Rajesh last week. And in the bigger picture, Solomon said the loss helped.
"It's always good to lose, it's not good to always be on top to see what you still need to work on, what you need to focus on," Solomon said.
Solomon will return to the state championship on June 1 at the National Tennis Center in Queens, but on Sunday, he was zeroed in on the present.
"I don't really know what the score is in the past," Solomon said. "I just focus on the next point and winning the next point and winning every point."
Syosset wins doubles title. Over the course of four seasons, Syosset's Eli Grossman and Preet Rajpal have gone from rivals, to good friends to a champion doubles duo.
The pair started competing against each other in tryouts in the eighth grade and became friends off the court in the years that followed. When unlikely circumstances from a rainout and obligations for other players created a need for a team, the juniors couldn't resist combining their talents for the first time.
"We always wanted to play with each other for a long time. It just hasn't worked out well," Grossman said. "When the opportunity came we both had to say yes, and here we are."
The pair defeated Roslyn's Zach Khazzam and Sangjin Song, 7-6 (5), 6-2, to claim the Nassau doubles title and return the title to Syosset for the third year running.
"We had a mindset going in that we were in the second seed and that played to our advantage," Rajpal said.
Rajpal and Grossman said there were some growing pains that came with teaming up for the first time, but their familiarity trumped those moments, and their friendship won out when it came time to pick each other up.
"We just had this feeling of where we're going to be," Rajpal said. "His athleticism, and our tennis brains together combined to be a really good storm for us too."
In addition to all finalists, singles consolation winner Rajon Vohra of North Shore and doubles consolation winners Tim Nacca and Patrick Bodowitz of Garden City qualified for the state tournament.

NYPD officer from LI injured in hatchet attack promoted to detective

Author: DeStefano, Anthony M

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The NYPD officer who was seriously injured in an attack by a hatchet-wielding man in October 2014 was promoted to detective Friday in a ceremony at police headquarters in Manhattan.
For Kenneth Healey, 28, who lives in Oceanside, his bump in rank is a dream come true. His father is a retired Nassau County police detective.
"It means a lot to me," Healey said before the ceremony, during which 151 NYPD officers received promotions. "Before I came on the job it was my goal to become a detective or sergeant."
That goal was put in serious jeopardy when a disturbed man pulled a hatchet out of his backpack and attacked Healey on a street in Jamaica, Queens. Healey was struck in the back of the head as he stood with two other cops, who shot and killed the attacker.
Healey was hospitalized and had to go through more than a year of grueling rehabilitation, during which he feared he might not return to work.
"When it first happened, I couldn't feel the left side of my body at all. I couldn't see on my left side. I couldn't walk. I couldn't dress myself. I couldn't tie my shoes," Healey recalled. "To get back to work was the main goal."
Healey, whose brother John became an NYPD officer in 2015, received the department's Medal of Honor in June 2016. He is currently assigned to Queens North and is expected to remain there. His new rank will be detective investigator.
At the ceremony, Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill gave a special shout-out to Healey, saying he was attacked because he was a cop.
O'Neill also made special mention of audience member Lisa Tuozzolo, the widow of NYPD Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo of Huntington, who was killed in action last year.

A shocking shooting and our toxic politics

Full text: A shocking shooting and our nation's toxic politics
My wholehearted thoughts and prayers go out to Rep. Steve Scalise and four others who were shot in Alexandria, Virginia .
Violence is never the answer to the tremendous social, economic and political challenges facing us. The spirit of cooperation must absolutely be revived among Republicans, Democrats and independents. Yes, a real revival of true nonpartisanship, to prevent the very heart and soul of America from becoming a systematically evil and out-of-control vigilante nation.
Rev. Arthur L. Mackey Jr., Roosevelt
Editor's note: The writer is a senior pastor at the Mount Sinai Baptist Church Cathedral in Roosevelt.

At the Alexandria baseball field, was the shooter from Sudan? Syria? Libya? Yemen? Iran? Somalia? No!
Meet James T. Hodgkinson from Illinois: homegrown hater.
Jack Cohen, Bayside
-
It may seem droll to substitute President Donald Trump for Julius Caesar in a play about assassination . It may be amusing for some comedians to make vile jokes about Trump.
Did any of these people consider what effect these performances have on emotionally challenged individuals?
While no one was killed in Alexandria except the shooter, the victims may feel the effects of their wounds for the rest of their lives. Can't people think of the consequences of their words or deeds before damage is done?
Marian Milne, Oceanside
-
The shootings at an innocent baseball practice were horrific. Impressionable people are influenced by our elected officials and look to them for guidance.
New York's two U.S. senators are guilty of turning citizens of political parties against each other.
Recently, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand used the F-word when speaking about whether President Donald Trump has kept his promises.
Since Trump was elected, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has ridiculed him. It's no wonder our nation is divided.
Let's pray for the recovery of Rep. Steve Scalise and the four others who were wounded.

Full text: Film star George Clooney and his business partners, Hewlett native Rande Gerber and real estate developer Mike Meldman, have sold their Manhasset-based tequila company for a potential $1 billion.
The London-based alcoholic-beverage conglomerate Diageo announced Wednesday that it had acquired the trio's four-year-old Casamigos Spirits for $700 million and a potential $300 million based on performance over 10 years. "This reflects Diageo's belief in our company and our belief in Diageo," Oscar winner Clooney, 56, said in a statement. "But we're not going anywhere. We'll still be very much a part of Casamigos. Starting with a shot tonight. Maybe two."
Casamigos "started from a friendship and an idea to create the best tasting, smoothest tequila as our own house tequila to drink and share with friends," said Gerber, a 1980 Hewlett High School graduate and founder of the bar and restaurant company Gerber Group, in a statement.
Gerber told CNBC last year that he and Clooney are tequila aficionados and worked with a distiller in Jalisco, Mexico, to develop a tequila solely for private use. But, he said, the distiller eventually "called and said, 'Hey guys, we have a little problem: In the past two years, we've been sending you about a thousand bottles a year. Either you're selling it or you're drinking way too much - either way, we can't keep calling it samples. You guys have to get licensed and do this right.' "
The brand went on to win numerous awards and sold 120,000 cases last year. It is expected to sell 170,000 by the end of this year, according to Diageo, whose brands include Johnnie Walker, J&B and Guinness. Casamigos is the company's largest acquisition since its $3.2 billion purchase of United Spirits Ltd. in 2014.
Gerber, the son of NewYork Jean Co. founder and Oceanside High School alumnus Jordan Gerber, has been married to former model Cindy Crawford since 1998. The couple have two children. Meldman is founder and CEO of the Arizona-based Discovery Land Co.

Hempstead Town hires outside law firm for code inspector case

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 Sep 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1940075668?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hempstead Town has hired Garden City law firm Jaspan Schlesinger to act as special prosecutor in a court case against a code officer accused of violating the town code, officials said.
The town charged Roy Gunther Jr. with a code violation in May, saying he allegedly allowed garbage and construction debris to pile up outside his Oceanside home during repairs of damage caused by superstorm Sandy. Gunther was also suspended from his job without pay for five days in late August.
Gunther appeared in court Aug. 17, and the case was adjourned until Tuesday as the town hired a special prosecutor to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Town spokesman Mike Deery said Jaspan Schlesinger attorney Jeffrey Schwartz would handle the case. Deery did not immediately have information on how much the firm would be paid.
Gunther, who is listed in 2016 payroll records as a "code enforcement officer III" in the town's building department, has worked for the town since 1999. His 2016 salary was $125,333. His attorney, Michael Elbaz, could not be reached on Monday.
Court documents state that an "on-site field inspection" of Gunther's home found "brick piles, milk crates, a sink, a toilet bowl, and varying garbage and construction debris stored on the property at the exterior of the dwelling."
Gunther had received two other summonses for failing to have a permit to disconnect a gas meter, but the charges were dropped because the building inspector wrote the wrong date on the ticket.
Jaspan Schlesinger also represents the town's Industrial Development Agency in a lawsuit about tax breaks for the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream. Nassau Republican Committee vice chairman Joseph Cairo's daughter Lisa works for the firm and is counsel on the Green Acres Mall case.

Long Island firefighters urge Cuomo to sign cancer benefits bill

Author: Uda, Rachel

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]28 Sep 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1943503370?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Island firefighters are urging the governor to sign a bill that would provide benefits for volunteer firefighters diagnosed with certain cancers.
Local fire chiefs and firefighters gathered Wednesday at the Port Washington Fire Department to ask Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to sign the bill, which passed in the State Legislature in June.
"Simply put, firefighters have a higher incidence of getting certain cancers than the general public does," said Steven Klein, vice president of the Firemen's Association of the State of New York and ex-fire chief for the Oceanside Fire Department.
Career firefighters in New York State already receive similar benefits to those outlined in the bill, "and cancer does not discriminate between paid and volunteer firefighters," he said.
Under the bill, qualified firefighters diagnosed with cancer would be eligible for a $25,000 lump sum payment, depending on the diagnosis.
Firefighters disabled because of cancer may also receive up to $1,500 a month for 36 months. The death benefit would be $50,000.
To be eligible, firefighters must have served at least five years as an interior firefighter and have had a physical exam that was cancer-free before he or she began volunteering.
Rich Azzopardi, spokesman for Cuomo, said in an email that "the legislation, which was one of more than 500 that passed both houses in the last days of session, has not yet been delivered to the Governor's desk."
"It remains under review by counsel's office," he added.
The Volunteer Firefighter Enhanced Cancer Disability Act was spurred by studies that show firefighters are contracting cancer after years of exposure to burning materials containing carcinogens, Klein said. It would be funded by local taxpayers, Klein said.
Thomas McDonough, 55, an ex-fire chief for the Port Washington Fire Department was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2013.
There's no history of thyroid issues in his family, and McDonough believes he, his mother and brother all contracted cancer because of their time battling blazes.
His mother was a Great Neck Vigilant firefighter who responded to the Sept. 11 terror attacks and died of lung cancer in June. McDonough's brother, a Great Neck Alert firefighter, is currently battling colon cancer.
McDonough is currently in remission but will continue to spend about $500 a year in out-of-pocket medical fees, he said.
"For volunteer firefighters, some don't have adequate insurance or are self-employed and have deductibles that are much higher," he said. "We should be able to at least do this for them and help their families defray the costs."

Drone captures image of Long Beach lightning strike

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 July 2016.

Abstract: Firefighters and paramedics treated five patients for "after shocks" felt as a result of the strike, such as a tingling feeling, Long Beach Professional firefighters and Long Beach Lifeguard Chief Paul Gillespie said.

Full text:   Long Beach firefighters tended to two beachgoers and three lifeguards Thursday evening after a single lightning strike hit the beach during the height of the city's Surf Week - an image captured by a drone filming a competition, officials said.
Spectators and lifeguards were standing on the beach about 5 p.m. near National Boulevard when a towering lightning strike came crashing onto the beach. Firefighters and paramedics treated five patients for "after shocks" felt as a result of the strike, such as a tingling feeling, Long Beach Professional firefighters and Long Beach Lifeguard Chief Paul Gillespie said.
None of the injuries were serious, Gillespie said. Three lifeguards were evaluated, including one man who reported tingling in his arm. All of the lifeguards were back to work Friday.
Two civilians were also treated, including one man who was taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside for evaluation.
Lifeguards had begun to evacuate the beach when the storm quickly rolled in.
"That cell came in so fast. I've never seen it come through like that before," Gillespie said. "In fifteen minutes, it was a beautiful summer day again."
Jason Belsky was filming the surfing finals for Skudin Surf when the storm rolled over surfers still in the water.
While standing on the beach, his drone was filming about 50 feet off shore and about 10 to 15 feet over the water when it captured the lightning strike hit the beach.
"It was like 'Boom!' right in frame. It was pretty sick actually," Belsky said. "We're all used to getting thunder showers in Long Beach but it got really dark in about 60 seconds and the one lightning bolt came down and then the rain came down. It was pretty crazy."
The National Weather Service recorded a group of people struck by lightning at 4:50 p.m. and reports of one person hospitalized.
A severe thunderstorm warning was issued for northern Nassau County and western Suffolk County until 5:15 p.m., but did not apply to Long Beach. The warning only applies to winds above 58 mph or hail an inch or larger and does not necessarily predict lightning, forecasters said.
"All thunderstorms, by definition, mean lighting is a constant factor," weather service meteorologist Tim Morrin said. "Unfortunately a cloud to ground lightning strike impact occurred and injured some folks."

Marine Corps can't dismiss Jason Brezler for emailing classified doc, judge rules

Author: Kessler, Robert E

Abstract: Major Jason Brezler, a reservist and also a member of the FDNY, had argued that when the Marine Board of Inquiry recommended his dismissal in 2013, it did so in retaliation after Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) inquired into the U.S. Naval Academy graduate's treatment, which also had become the subject of media attention.

Full text:   A federal judge in Central Islip Tuesday barred the Marine Corps from dismissing a major who emailed a classified document over an unsecured line but claimed he did it to potentially save the lives of fellow Marines in Afghanistan.
Major Jason Brezler, a reservist and also a member of the FDNY, had argued that when the Marine Board of Inquiry recommended his dismissal in 2013, it did so in retaliation after Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) inquired into the U.S. Naval Academy graduate's treatment, which also had become the subject of media attention. Brezler also said the board did not give him an adequate chance to defend himself.
U.S. District Judge Joseph Bianco ruled that the Marine board, in violation of military procedures, denied Brezler a number of internal documents he might have used in his defense. Among them were materials that could have shown the board was apparently convened only after an article on Brezler's situation appeared in the Marine Corps Times and King had made his inquiries.
Tuesday night, King said Bianco's decision represented "a great day for Jason Brezler and a great day for justice. Major Brezler is a true American hero."
The classified email Brezler sent from Oklahoma back to his former base in Afghanistan involved what he said was the sordid history of an Afghani official. A teenage boy with the official eventually shot and killed three Marines on the base, including Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. of Oceanside.
Bianco said there would have to be a fair hearing if the Marine Corps wished to kick Brezler out.
"The Court emphasizes that . . . it has not concluded that the BOI was in fact retaliatory, or that the final agency action in separating the plaintiff from the Marine Corps was arbitrary and capricious," Bianco said. " clearly prevented Major Brezler from fully and fairly litigating his retaliation claims."
Brezler's attorney, Michael Bowe, said: "This is a stunning rebuke of the fundamentally unjust proceedings to which this decorated Marine was subjected for three years."
James Margolin, a spokesman for the Southern District U.S. Attorney' office, which represented the Marines and the Navy in the case, declined to comment.

North Shore Middle School given School to Watch award

Author: Olson, David

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]07 Mar 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770844940?accountid=37869

Abstract: Among the characteristics that Schools to Watch recognizes are academic excellence; support for students' intellectual, ethical, social and physical development; a commitment to high-quality instruction and support for all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities; a value for diversity; and norms and policies that encourage achievement.

Full text:   North Shore Middle School in Glen Head has been named a 2016 Essential Elements School to Watch, which recognizes students' social and ethical development in addition to academic excellence.
North Shore is one of only 28 schools statewide to earn the recognition over the past decade, said Marybeth Casey, New York State co-director of Schools to Watch and an associate in curriculum and instruction for the state Department of Education. There are more than 400 winners nationwide during the same period.
The Illinois-based National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform established the Schools to Watch program in 1999 and selects winning schools.
"It's not a prize to be won, but more of a trajectory of improvement that schools have to be on," Casey said.
Among the characteristics that Schools to Watch recognizes are academic excellence; support for students' intellectual, ethical, social and physical development; a commitment to high-quality instruction and support for all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities; a value for diversity; and norms and policies that encourage achievement.
Marc Ferris, principal of North Shore, said the recognition validates the school's approach to education.
"While other schools may have been rigorously preparing for tests, we have had a much different approach, which is looking at the whole child and making sure we support the social and emotional needs of young adolescents, in addition to providing an academic program," he said.
Educators visit schools applying for the recognition and select honorees, Casey said. Schools typically spend a few years preparing for the site visit, to better adhere their programs to Schools to Watch criteria, she said. The rigorous process limits the number of schools that apply.
The only other New York school to apply for first-time recognition this year, Memorial Junior High School in Valley Stream, was named a "rising school to watch," a step below full recognition.
Six Long Island schools had previously earned the Schools to Watch recognition: Carrie Palmer Weber Middle School in Port Washington; Garden City Middle School; Jericho Middle School; Sayville Middle School; Oceanside Middle School; and Longwood Junior High School in Middle Island.

Abstract: Singas said Burke admitted stealing the money for personal use. Because he pleaded guilty, Burke will be barred from holding office in any union, prosecutors said.

Full text:   A former treasurer of Utility Workers Local 365 pleaded guilty Wednesday to stealing more than $110,000 from the Nassau County-based union, prosecutors said.
Charles Burke, 47, of Oceanside, made his plea before District Court Judge Martin Massell to one count of scheme to defraud in the second degree, a misdemeanor.
Burke could spend up to a year in prison and is due back for sentencing June 13, prosecutors said.
He paid back the union $70,000 before his arrest, and the Nassau district attorney's office said he would be ordered to pay the remaining $41,000 in restitution through the probation department.
"For more than five years, the defendant lined his pockets with the union dues of his fellow union members," District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement. "With today's plea, the defendant is now forced to repay the money he has stolen. I thank our partners at the U.S. Department of Labor who helped us investigate and prosecute this case."
Under terms of the plea, Burke will not do any time in jail but he will get 3 years' probation, said Burke's Garden City attorney Ronald Beckoff.
"He is a good man, he's a family man," Beckoff said. "He had a problem, which has been resolved. I'm confident the courts will never see him again."
Beckoff said the remaining money will be paid back over the course of the next three years.
Burke's theft was uncovered when Local 365 in October 2014 was notified by the Utility Workers Union of America International treasurer that more than two years of payments due had not been received, prosecutors said.
Singas said that in addition to withholding dues Burke wrote checks to himself and made withdrawals from Local 365's bank accounts without the union's knowledge. Singas said Burke admitted stealing the money for personal use.
Because he pleaded guilty, Burke will be barred from holding office in any union, prosecutors said.

Common Core ads becomes issue in race for Skelos seat

Author: Brodsky, Robert

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]13 Apr 2016.

Abstract: New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany, a political action committee formed by StudentsFirst, a nonprofit that supports charter schools and Common Core standards, spent $1.28 million last week on TV ads and polling against Kaminsky (D-Long Beach), according to State Board of Election records.

Full text:   Assemb. Todd Kaminsky, the Democratic candidate for the seat of former State Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, on Tuesday accused his GOP opponent, Christopher McGrath, of "cozying up" to a pro-Common Core group that funded a $1.2 million ad buy in advance of the April 19 special election.
New Yorkers for a Balanced Albany, a political action committee formed by StudentsFirst, a nonprofit that supports charter schools and Common Core standards, spent $1.28 million last week on TV ads and polling against Kaminsky (D-Long Beach), according to State Board of Election records.
The ad, titled "Taxing Todd," says a Kaminsky victory would allow Mayor Bill de Blasio to control all levers of state government, increasing taxes for Long Islanders.
The PAC spending came a week after Senate Republicans helped obtain $54 million in funding in the 2016 state budget for charter schools statewide - a 3 percent increase.
At a news conference in Oceanside with education activists, Kaminsky accused Senate Republicans of orchestrating a "secret deal" to fund the ads in exchange for the charter school hike. "Advocates for the Common Core ... advocates for charter schools are trying to come down here on Long Island and steal this election," Kaminsky said.
Senate GOP spokesman Scott Reif called the allegation "slanderous" and said the campaign was legally prohibited from coordinating with outside groups. "Senate Republicans, however, aren't going to apologize for providing a record level of total funding for Long Island schools," Reif said.
McGrath, an attorney from Hewlett, "opposes the implementation of Common Core" and "understands the need to eliminate the unnecessary over testing of our kids and return to local control of our schools," said campaign spokesman E. O'Brien Murray.
Jenny Sedlis, executive director of StudentsFirstNY, defended the ad. "Albany functions better when one party isn't in control of everything and our schools perform better when legislators who care about education are in office," she said.
McGrath's campaign also criticized Kaminsky for missing Assembly votes Monday on bills addressing obesity education and women's pay equity. Kaminsky has missed five days in Albany and 28 votes since March 29, the campaign said.
"It's hypocritical of him to ask for their vote to be their senator, when he can't show up for work and represent them on important issues as an assemblyman," said McGrath spokesman Marcus Povinelli.
Kaminsky has an "outstanding" attendance record in the Assembly, said campaign spokesman Evan Thies.
Kaminsky and McGrath are vying for the 9th Senate District seat, which was vacated in December when Skelos was convicted on federal corruption charges. He and his son, Adam, who also was convicted in the case, are appealing.
Laurence Hirsh, an accountant from Valley Stream, is running on the Green Party line.

Pastry maker donates tips to help kids with Down syndrome

Author: Uda, Rachel

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]05 May 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1786760187?accountid=37869

Abstract: Nahmias has donated her tips to a couple of nonprofits, including GiGi's Playhouse, a Manhattan-based program that provides services for children with Down syndrome, playhouse director Benny Kaufman said.

Full text:   For years, Jessy Nahmias carried a plastic tip jar with her as she sold her empanadas and pastries at fairs and food markets across Long Island.
Over the past couple of years Nahmias has collected about $6,000 in that jar, which has a photo of her deceased son Brandon affixed to its side below a small placard requesting tips for children with Down syndrome.
She has donated all the money she has collected to nonprofits providing services for children with the genetic disorder.
Brandon was born with Down syndrome and a heart condition in 2005. Shortly after his second birthday, he caught a virus and died.
"I never thought I would leave that hospital without my son," Nahmias, 51, of East Rockaway said. "When he died I was totally lost. I never thought I'd get over it."
It took about three years before she felt like she was "functioning normally" again. She began baking for fun and later started selling her treats at school fairs and other events, where she would collect tips.
"I decided that I wanted to do something with the money, and it occurred to me that I could use my tips to help other children with Down syndrome."
Nahmias has donated her tips to a couple of nonprofits, including GiGi's Playhouse, a Manhattan-based program that provides services for children with Down syndrome, playhouse director Benny Kaufman said.
GiGi's Playhouse recently started a "virtual tip jar" on their website so people can donate online, according to Kaufman. The group also honored Nahmias and her husband, Michael, in March.
"Jessy's help and support means so much to us," Kaufman said. "We're really inspired by her story."
In April, Nahmias' tip jar found a new home. It now sits on the counter of Jessy's Pastries in Oceanside, Nahmias' newly opened empanadas and baked goods store, where she is planning to hire people with Down syndrome.
"I'm so grateful to have this business and this storefront, and so happy that I can remember Brandon in this way," she said.

Rajesh, Rajpal lead Syosset to Nassau team tennis title

Abstract: There were new, fresh faces on the court for Syosset but the result was the same for the Braves Tuesday in the Nassau team tennis final at Eisenhower Park against Roslyn.

Full text:   There were new, fresh faces on the court for Syosset but the result was the same for the Braves Tuesday in the Nassau team tennis final at Eisenhower Park against Roslyn.
Behind freshman Neel Rajesh and eighth grader Kabir Rajpal at first and second singles, the top-seeded Braves defeated No. 3 Roslyn, 5-2, to cap its second straight undefeated championship season.
"We both felt a little more pressure coming into the match today," Rajesh said. "We knew we had to help keep the reputation and tradition going."
Rajesh was on serve in the first set against Sangjin Song with the chance to close it out. Sangjin fought back for a break to tie it at 5 but Rajesh kept his poise to break Song and close out the set 7-5.
"It's tough playing against him because we've played each other so much," Rajesh said. "He knows how I'm going to play and he's really able to strategize."
Rajesh won the second set 6-2 minutes after Syosset's second doubles team of Adam Canarick and Yash Samantaray defeated Ben Tenner and Jared Cohen 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to clinch the title.
Rajpal, who won the county doubles title with Rajesh last week at Oceanside, defeated Roslyn's Zach Khazzam 6-3, 6-4.
"We knew coming into the season the competition was going to be very tough," Syosset coach Shai Fisher said. "We lost a ton of kids from last year and it's really a testament to these players how seriously they take their tennis and how they've been able to improve from not only one season to another but during this season."
Aditya Dave and Zach Chan defeated Andrew Lieblich and Evan Kirsch 6-3, 7-5 at third doubles for the Braves, who split the four doubles matches and swept the singles matchups.
"This is honestly the best feeling to end your senior year with a championship," Dave said. "We worked hard throughout the season to prepare for this . . . it's something that I'll cherish for the rest of my life."

Plainedge kicker Dylan Burns has big leg: Will compete for LI all-stars Tuesday in Empire Challenge Burns is Long Island's all-time leader in extra points

Author: Kramer, Ari

Abstract: Burns, the kicker for Plainedge and Long Island's Empire Challenge squad, was confined to the 10-yard line as the offense and defense occupied the rest of field.

Full text:   With the wind blowing at his back, Dylan Burns lined up at the 10-yard line. Long Island's all-time leader in extra points was aiming for the unprecedented.
Burns, the kicker for Plainedge and Long Island's Empire Challenge squad, was confined to the 10-yard line as the offense and defense occupied the rest of field. He wanted to boot one out of Hofstra's Shuart Stadium.
"I knew it was kind of impossible, but it's a nice goal," said Burns, who broke East Islip's Sean Moller's career record of 121 extra points last season. Burns came close, hitting the tarp that covered the last section of seats behind the goalpost.
The Albany commit said he could convert a 55-yard field goal, and he hopes to get the chance Tuesday when Long Island faces New York City in the 21st Empire Challenge at 7 p.m. at Shuart Stadium. As the only kicker on Long Island's roster, Burns knows he will start. The rest of Long Island's starters were announced after Monday's practice.
Ryan Klemm (Newfield) will start at quarterback with Davien Kuinlan (Plainedge) behind him in the backfield. Jared Wolfe (MacArthur) and James Paczkowski (Oceanside) will be in the slot, and Mike Elardo (Syosset) and Jelani Greene (Newfield) will be at wide receiver. Nick Ramirez (Lawrence) will start at center, with Matt Mascia (East Meadow), Kieran Glynn (Miller Place), Anthony Catapano (Carey) and Spencer Matthaei (Locust Valley) filling out the offensive line.
Livingstone Harriott (Central Islip), Denzel Williams (Newfield), Wayne White (Glenn) and Jerome Brooks (St. John the Baptist) make up the secondary, and Michael Rothberg (MacArthur), Bobby Bove (Lindenhurst) and Antonio Scala (Longwood) will start at linebacker. Charlie Tomassetti (Farmingdale), Marc Arboleda (MacArthur), Matt Weiss (Longwood) and Anthony Lavio (Longwood) form the defensive line.
"We're going to go out there, stay disciplined," said Harriott, who was named a co-captain with Kuinlan and Nick Garone (Eastport-South Manor). "Everyone's going to do their job. I'm going to try my best to command the defense . . . and we're going to get it done."
New York City has a few players committed to high-profile college programs. OLB Elias Reynolds and OL Justin Morgan signed with Pitt, and WR Ahmed Bah with Rutgers.
"I'm glad that we get to go up against kids that are going to be playing at the highest level at the next level," Harriott said.
The New York City roster also features two Stony Brook commits: MLB Abdoulaye Konate and OL Malik Bethea.

Abstract: Since we make a lot of seafood and pasta, it's huge."

Full text:   BEFORE
Homeowners Joan and John Gross, both 66, bought their Oceanside house in 2005, but Joan says she was never happy with the kitchen. "It was so worn that all the Formica was coming off the countertops," says Joan, a recently retired human resources director. "Also, it was a dated all-white ... with cheap cabinets. " After they bought new appliances, they saved for 10 years for a renovation.
AFTER
OPENING UP
The old kitchen had a wall that cut it off from the living room. Joan says she wanted to open that up so she could interact with guests while cooking.
CABINET CASE
The couple worked with Luis Viteri of Showcase Kitchens, who found a way to get them what they needed within their budget. "He designed the kitchen for us," says Joan. "He came to the house and measured, and helped with the cabinets, and then we ordered from his company."
COUNTER POINT
When it came to choosing a new countertop, Joan says she knew the one thing she didn't want was anything white. She took a sample of the dark cabinets Viteri showed her, and she went to RAI in Garden City Park. "It's not a regular-looking granite," she says. "It's a dark brown and white."
ISLAND PARADISE
Now that the kitchen is opened up to the rest of the room, it's even easier for the Grosses to socialize with family and friends. Having a large central island is key for that. "Luis built a huge island for us, which is so convenient," said Joan. "With five grandchildren, they can all sit on stools around the island, and it's like the kids' table. Plus, the kitchen sink and dishwasher are in the island, and there's cabinets, too. Even the garbage is inside the island."
DETAILS COUNT
The finishing touches were almost as important as the bold strokes when it came to design and convenience. For example, the new faucet has been a lifesaver, she says. "I love the pot-filler faucet," adds Joan. "I love being able to fill my pots without having to drag pots around the kitchen. Since we make a lot of seafood and pasta, it's huge."
PRICE
Cesar Italian cabinetry by Showcase Kitchens (locations in Manhasset and Massapequa): $18,500
Porcelain marble-look floor tiles, discounted: $2,500
Granite countertop: $3,000
Lighting: $500

TOTAL: $25,500

This is how to shorten lines at the DMV

Full text: Your article "4 Tips for Dealing with DMV" misses the point [News, Feb. 18]. I believe the Green Light Law was not about safety for other drivers but was about getting people licenses so they can eventually vote. If people break our laws and are given what they don't deserve, let them wait. If the government elitists cared about their constituents, they would have at least arranged certain days of the week for people living in our country illegally to register or only at certain Department of Motor Vehicle offices. Then, citizens would not have to be on line for hours.
Same goes for the new no-bail law. First, the geniuses rush to pass it, and when it explodes, they need to make changes. Let us know when someone spots the governor, New York City mayor or any other proponent of these crazy laws on one of these lines.
Steve Feuer,
Oceanside
How about this, Department of Motor Vehicles: People living without legal permission seeking a driver's license under the Green Light Law go to a separate location. Open up new locations just for these individuals. It's common sense.

Research group doing coronavirus trials

Full text: The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, the research arm of Northwell Health, said Friday it has started enrolling hospitalized patients in COVID-19 clinical trials.
The research group said it was enrolling patients who were in severe and critical condition and under care at a Northwell hospital.
The trials are being launched in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies Gilead Sciences of Foster City, California, and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.
Executives at Northwell and Regeneron said at a news conference Friday that it was unclear how long the trials would run, or if any drug could be rolled out widely to COVID-19 patients.
Dr. Kevin J. Tracey, president and CEO of Feinstein, said clinical trials are key while vaccines are being developed. He said work is being done around the globe to develop a vaccine, but that's "one and a half years away, and we don't know if it works."
"The fact that a vaccine is being worked on already is unprecedented in science," he said. "It took 50 years to discover a polio vaccine. The scientific community already knows the sequence of this virus and are working on vaccines, and this is very positive."
Both pharmaceutical companies are seeking trial enrollees nationwide. Regeneron and Gilead also have started enrolling patients hospitalized at Mount Sinai Health System facilities. Mount Sinai operates hospitals in the metropolitan area, including Oceanside-based Mount Sinai South Nassau.
Mount Sinai South Nassau has one patient on a Gilead trial, with more pending, said Dr. Aaron E. Glatt, chair of the department of medicine and the chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau.
The Regeneron trial specifically targets a human antibody called sarilumab, which triggers the activity that leads to some patients suffering from severe pneumonia.
Gilead is running two trials that study the safety and efficacy of remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, to reduce the intensity and duration of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.

Hospitals restrict visits in maternity wards

Author: Reich-Hale, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two of the largest health systems in the New York region have tightened their no-visitation policies amid the coronavirus pandemic to include their maternity departments.
Manhattan-based Mount Sinai Health Systems and New York-Presbyterian this week have banned anyone, including significant others, from accompanying delivering mothers, according to new visitation policies.
Mount Sinai operates Oceanside-based Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital. New York-Presbyterian does not operate hospitals in Nassau or Suffolk counties but does have doctors offices throughout Queens, and it runs a hospital in Flushing.
"By implementing this, we create the safest setting for patients, newborns and our health care providers," said Dr. Alan Garely, chairman of the OB-GYN department at Mount Sinai South Nassau. "I really can't stress enough how sensitive this decision was. But this makes us the safest hospital on Long Island."
The new policy went into effect throughout the eight-hospital Mount Sinai system on Tuesday. 
New York-Presbyterian put the policy into effect on Monday. In a statement, the health system said "we understand this will be difficult for our patients and their loved ones, but we believe that this is a necessary step to promote the safety of our new mothers and children."
Mount Sinai South Nassau said it was setting up mobile units that include iPads for families to experience the childbirth. 
"We are going to do everything to make this a pleasurable and unique experience for everyone," Garely said. 
Every health system in the region has severely limited who can visit patients, including in the maternity area, amid the virus outbreak.
For example, Manhattan-based NYU Langone, which operates NYU Winthrop in Mineola, said it follows the state Department of Health guidelines, which calls for only one support person to be with the child-bearer.
New Hyde Park-based Northwell Health, the largest health system on Long Island, has also put limits on visitors, but it has not banned a partner from being at a child's birth, said spokesman Terry Lynam.
"We allow that person to come, but after the birth itself, we expect them to leave," Lynam sa

Drop-off site for recyclables open

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]09 Apr 2020: 26.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Town of Hempstead has opened a drop-off site for recyclables while the town temporarily suspends curbside recycling pickup.
Town officials suspended recycling pickup last week because of a workforce shortage from employees calling in sick or going into quarantine from COVID-19. Officials said they were concerned about having enough staff to maintain regular garbage pickup twice a week.
The closure affects communities including Bellmore, Bethpage, East Meadow, Levittown, Lido Beach, Point Lookout, Seaford, Uniondale and Wantagh. Town officials said the policy would be revaluated each week.
Recycling was also suspended in the Oceanside Sanitation District. Pickup in other districts and villages are decided separately.
Residents can now drop off recycling at the homeowner disposal site at the town's sanitation facility in Merrick at 1600 Merrick Rd. from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on weekends. The site is closed on Easter.
A list of what items are accepted can be found at hempsteadny.gov.

Full text: The Town of Hempstead will resume recycling Monday after suspending curbside recycling pickup for the past month.
The town stopped collecting recycling because of staffing shortages caused by workers calling in sick and being in quarantine from COVID-19.
Officials said they had to suspend recycling to regions such as Bellmore, Bethpage, East Meadow, Levittown, Lido Beach, Point Lookout, Seaford, Uniondale and Wantagh because they were concerned about scheduling regular trash pickup.
"We have taken steps to ensure that the public and our sanitation and recycling workers are safe," town officials said in a statement.
Recycling will resume May 4, when residents can place items on the curb for regularly scheduled pickup.
Recycling was also suspended in Oceanside and Long Beach, where those communities are asking residents to mix recycling with regular trash pickup until the pandemic has subsided.

Recycling back in Long Beach

Full text: The City of Long Beach will resume recycling pickup Wednesday after a two-month hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
City officials suspended recycling collection in April after the city's provider, Omni Recycling of Westbury, was hit hard during the pandemic and was unable to continue single-stream recycling.
The city will resume single-stream collection through the rest of the month, but begin to switch to dual-stream collections of separate plastic, glass, metal and paper collection in July as the city negotiates a new contract.
Oceanside Sanitation District No. 7 will also resume recycling pickup on Wednesday and Thursday.
Hempstead resumed recycling last month to its communities, including in Bellmore, Bethpage, East Meadow, Levittown, Lido Beach, Point Lookout, Seaford, Uniondale and Wantagh, after a staffing shortage affected regular trash pickup.
The state Department of Environmental Conservation ordered offsite recycling facilities to resume collecting cans and bottles last week.

Full text: I applaud your resolutions for 2020 ["Let us aim to do better," Editorial, Jan. 1].
I would like to add another resolution/goal. We must work for equity for our citizens with mental health concerns. People with mental health issues do not receive the same percentage of payment for mental health-related services as do their friends and neighbors with physical health bills.
New York State has mental health equity laws but they are not always adhered to. We must have provider-prevails laws. Psychiatrists must be able to prescribe medication they believe will benefit patients. Often, mentally ill people must fail with other medicines before the doctors' original choices are followed. We also need appropriate mental health housing with wraparound supportive services. Mental health care workers must receive decent, appropriate salaries.
Solitary confinement in prisons for mentally ill patients, as well as people without mental health issues, must end. It is inhumane and often exacerbates conditions. The key word is health. There should be equal treatment for all health conditions.
David Sills,
Oceanside
Editor's note: The writer is president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness for Nassau and Queens in Lake Success.
��
A word on cap on state & local taxes
I wonder whether the federal deduction on state and local taxes, now capped at $10,000, is political punishment.
The voters of our state have supported good schools, well-paid uniformed and state workers who provide for those in need. You get what you pay for, and I think we get what is needed to continue the success of Long Island and the state.
Other states don't provide as we do. It's their choice. The tax is regressive for communities trying to handle challenges. Why should they be penalized?
Money for the average person helps more than another gift for the lucky few.

Shoreham

Gourmutt dining: With pet food delivery, it's humans who do the fetching for dogs and cats

Full text: Penny, a 3-year-old black lab, beagle and French bulldog mix has a set policy when it comes to eating standard-issue pet food: No can do.
"She's picky and gets bored with her food," says Penny's owner, Karla Modolo, of Oceanside. Respite for Penny and other canine foodies comes in the form of fresh-cooked dog food services that deliver straight to Long Island doorsteps. Now Penny dines on meals like Tail Waggin' Turkey (ground meat with brown rice, carrots, apples and pumpkin blended with nutrients) prepped in a professional kitchen to the tune of about $95 a month. 
Modolo, 46, a senior officer for the consulate general of Monaco in Manhattan, is among a growing number of dog and cat parents getting in on the fresh-cooked food delivery trend. They say it's just as important for their pets to eat healthy, natural and unprocessed food as it is for people to cope with such problems as digestive issues and obesity.
Mollie Cohen, 35, of Amagansett, and her husband, Andrew, 36, used to order ingredient-and-recipe meal kits for themselves from a food service when they first decided to cook more and eat healthier instead of relying on takeout. The Cohens, who own a furniture business in Brooklyn, have since kept up with the cooking part - but they now go to the grocery store and farm stands for ingredients. Only one family member has fresh food prepared and deliver

NORTH HEMPSTEAD TOWN: PARKS COMMISSIONER RETIRES

Author: Zou, Dandan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Jill Weber, North Hempstead's Department of Parks and Recreation commissioner, has retired, making her the third town official to leave a top-level position since December.
Weber, 59, of Oceanside, retired on June 28. She oversaw the town's 52 parks, 80 full-time and more than 300 part-time and seasonal employees for 4½ years. The parks department has an operating budget of $17 million. Weber's annual salary was $131,057.
Director of government research Steven Pollack will be the acting parks commissioner until the town finds Weber's replacement, officials said. His salary increased to $125,000 from $75,798.
"We thank Jill Weber for her service to the Town during her tenure as Parks Commissioner and we wish her well in her retirement," Town Supervisor Judi Bosworth said in a statement.
Weber, a career parks and recreation manager, joined the town administration in January 2015. Before that, she worked for the New York City parks department in various capacities for more than 35 years.
"I feel proud of the work I did," Weber said in an interview Wednesday. "I look forward to visiting the parks as a resident of Nassau County."
When Weber oversaw the parks department, Alvan O. Petrus Park in Port Washington was rebuilt. During her tenure, she restructured the parks department to separate the recreation and maintenance divisions, Weber said, and pushed to open the first dog park in town and change some rules to allow dogs in some town parks.  
In her early career, Weber was a horticulturist for Central Park and then Riverside Park in Manhattan. After that, she became a manager for the New York City parks department in the Bronx  before landing a job as the chief of the New York City Parks Opportunity Program. She later became involved in policy, planning, fundraising, community engagement and programming of parks and the beach in Rockaway and Broad Channel in Queens.
Deputy Town Supervisor Aline Khatchadourian left her job in January, and Town Attorney Elizabeth Botwin stepped down from her position in December.
Bosworth and council members on Tuesday passed a personnel resolution that approved hiring Leigh Chin to be the deputy town clerk, replacing Eileen Kranberg, who will be the secretary for the parks commissioner. Chin will be paid a yearly salary of $90,000 and Kranberg $96,83

Full text: NYPD Officer James Zadroga died 13 years ago.
We knew then that a crisis was underway. First responders and others who had been at the World Trade Center site during and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks were getting sick and dying. But we didn't know how awful it would be - or how disappointingly long it would take to help them.
While it took more than a decade, Congress finally did the right thing, and President Donald Trump did his part, too, when the Victim Compensation Fund, born from an act named after Zadroga in 2009, was finally made permanent this week. The bill Trump signed Monday poignantly included two additional names - Ray Pfeifer, an FDNY firefighter from Hicksville who died in 2017, and Luis Alvarez, an NYPD detective from Oceanside who died in June.
The new law permanently funds the critically important compensation fund, essentially creating a blank check to aid tens of thousands of people who headed into harm's way and worked on the tragic site known as "the pile." Perpetuation of the compensation fund and the World Trade Center Health Program, which was permanently funded in 2015, is the least America can do.
More than 22,000 individuals have been awarded money from the compensation fund; another 21,000 claims await decisions. Since February, payments were reduced when the fund ran low. Now, the Justice Department, which oversees the compensation fund, should pay what is owed, quickly. Appropriate administration of the fund and health program should continue, unlike the misguided attempt last year to weaken the health program by moving it out of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
Tragically, many more people will get sick and die. Now, these brave responders and others who suffer know their country will care for them and their families. And out of the darkness of such a horrific time comes a ray of light.  - The editorial board

EDITORIAL: THE TERRIBLE DEATH OF KHASEEN MORRIS

Full text: To the crowd of teen onlookers hovering Monday afternoon at a strip mall that is a regular gathering spot for Oceanside High School students, the fight they were waiting to see probably didn't sound momentous. In high school, big brawls are often rumored but rarely materialize. Even if punches do fly, little of significance happens. Faces and reputations are bruised, anecdotes generated.
But on Monday afternoon, Khaseen Morris and at least one friend were attacked by six or seven youths, and Morris was stabbed. Morris, 16, died at a local hospital. On Wednesday, Tyler Flach, an 18-year-old from Lido Beach, was arrested in connection with the stabbing and charged with murder in the second degree.  Based on police statements and videos online, many of the 50 to 70 students present used their phones to record the brawl - and images of Morris bleeding on the sidewalk - rather than try to prevent the killing or  help Morris after the fight. 
The videos show a frightening, one-sided melee, with those six or seven young men brutally punching and kicking Morris and a friend, who suffered a broken arm and head injury. The scene of gaping onlookers recording such suffering rather than addressing it is disappointing and disconcerting. But we don't have all the facts yet, and given the level of violence, anyone intervening to stop it would have been brave, and maybe foolish.
Police say they need more information from combatants and onlookers to make their case. The kids who were there, who did not or could not prevent the attack on Morris and failed to aid him as he lay dying, must at least help deliver justice. -The edi

NORTH HEMPSTEAD: TOWN FILLS PARKS COMMISSIONER POST

Full text: North Hempstead Town hired a new leader for its parks department Wednesday, selecting someone from the same agency where the previous parks commissioner worked.
Arnyce Foster-Hernandez, 44, of Harlem spent the past 30 years at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, 25 of those as a manager. She started at age 15 as a journalism intern then became a manager at 18. She begins her North Hempstead post Oct. 7 with a $132,000 salary. 
Foster-Hernandez called herself a policy-driven and personable leader and said she is eager to get to know the parks staff better. She said she's anxious to do an assessment of the conditions of all town parks.  
"I'm a cosmetics person," Foster-Hernandez said. "Let's just see how we can pretty things up and green up as much [space] as I can."
Foster-Hernandez takes over one of the town's largest departments. North Hempstead operates 52 parks and the parks department has a $17 million budget that helps manage 80 full-time staff and more than 300 part-time, seasonal employees, such as lifeguards, for the swimming pools. 
Foster-Hernandez said her overall goal is to give residents a "happy, healthy, fun experience in the parks." 
Supervisor Judi Bosworth called Foster-Hernandez's stint in New York City impressive and said town officials are looking forward to new ideas she will bring to the job. 
"Arnyce has a long history with the New York City parks department, starting when she was a teenager," Bosworth said Wednesday. "She has extensive professional experience in developing and maintaining a high standard of park programming and special events for the city's park patrons, [and] she has led successful fundraising initiatives that ensured the longevity of programming and membership at New York City parks." 
Foster-Hernandez replaces Jill Weber, who held the post for more than four years.
Weber, 59, of Oceanside, retired June 28. She joined North Hempstead in January 2015 after spending more than 35 years in the New York City parks department. Her annual salary was $131,057.
With the hiring of Foster-Hernandez, the town has one more commissioner-level position to fill - highway su

Sometimes the clothes are not even that old, but I grew so fast I grew out of them. I know what I donate will go to people who need it. My mom told me that there are a lot of people who need things, and when they do, they go to the church for help. I usually give them big bags of clothes and shoes. My mom gives her old clothes, too.
Our church does great things for the community. They give food to people who are hungry, and they have a big feast every year with lots of rides and food. 
I hope that I am able to help a lot of people with a bag that size.

Full text: Regional health systems said Friday they are�offering payment flexibility for patients who are feeling the financial effects of the weeks-long partial federal shutdown.�Lawmakers and President Donald Trump on Friday reached a short-term deal to reopen the government through Feb. 15.
New Hyde Park-based Northwell Health said customers who express hardship are eligible for a range of payment options, from placing a temporary hold on the account and avoiding the collections process to seeing if they qualify for financial assistance.
"Northwell Health wants to help federal workers who are being impacted by the government shutdown to ensure that financial concerns are not impeding necessary medical care," said Richard Miller, executive vice president and chief business strategy officer for Northwell Health.
Those seeking financial support must show proof that they are federal employees.
They can speak with a customer care professional at 800-995-5727 or apply online through Northwell's financial assistance portal.
Also, South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside said in a statement, it "will work with any patient, including federal employees who have been furloughed, who are experiencing financial hardships."
The hospital, which is part of the Mount Sinai Health System, added, "Finances should not be a barrier to receiving quality care."
Catholic Health Services said all copays, coinsurance and deductibles will be waived for federal workers and their insured family members for emergency care at any one of the health system's�six hospitals as long as the government is shut down.
The waiver also includes emergency services provided by CHS's employed physicians.
Individuals will need to prove�they are affected federal employees. Catholic Health Services said people can call 631-465-6209 if they have�questions.

Hempstead takes a step to keep its young adults

Full text: Today's lesson in good zoning decisions is taught to you by ... the Town of Hempstead. Yes, that's right.
First, the Hempstead Town Board recently approved a crucial rezoning of the areas near the Inwood and Lawrence train stations, allowing for buildings up to five stories and 60 units per acre, with as much as 20 percent of the housing deemed "affordable." The board also approved plans for a 230-unit apartment building in Oceanside.
Then, Hempstead Councilwoman Erin King Sweeney announced plans to form a commission to review the town zoning code to make sure mixed-use and apartment projects are not prohibited by "antiquated, 1970s-style zoning ordinances."
The councilwoman's move forward was in part inspired by research by nextLI, a Newsday initiative that found that two-thirds of young Long Islanders plan to leave Long Island within five years.
Of course, there's a long way to go before Hempstead Town really changes its attitudes toward housing and new projects. Just this month, two councilmen emerged with typical "suburban way of life" concerns about Belmont Park's redevelopment.
But any path forward starts with a few forward-thinking leaders. Hempstead is smart to get on board. Rethinking zoning is one step toward finding ways to attract and keep the younger generation that wants to stay, but can't afford to do so.
Each town and village also must do more to welcome different types of housing and projects. The track record on that remains mixed. In one example, Islandia Mayor Allan Dorman said last month that he does not support apartments in the village. "Not once. Zip. Nada."
The consequences of Islandia's response, if replicated by other municipalities, will be devastating to the region's future. Hempstead is trying a better way.

LIers lament closing of Hot Skates rink

Full text: Hot Skates and high school - for several generations of Long Islanders, the two were linked. News Friday that the Lynbrook indoor roller-skating rink is shutting down prompted waves of nostalgia from grown-ups who remember spending weekend nights hoping to hold hands with a crush during couples-only skates.
"I think I spent almost every Friday night there from seventh grade to senior year," says Cheryl Radecker Denecke, 30, of Levittown, who graduated from Valley Stream North High School in 2006. "I had one of my birthday parties there growing up."
The rink was such a part of people's lives that it has been featured on reality TV shows - Bethenny Frankel, who spent part of her childhood on Long Island, reminisced about Hot Skates on her Bravo TV show, "Bethenney Ever After," and J.P. Rosenbaum, who grew up in Roslyn, and now-wife Ashley Hebert had their hometown date there on ABC's "The Bachelorette" in 2011.
Mequity Acquisitions LLC is buying the 14 Merrick Rd. facility, and plans to tear down the current building, replacing it with a CubeSmart, a national self-storage company.
"It just kind of stinks," says Kelly Flannery Driggers, 43, who grew up in Oceanside and graduated from Hempstead's Sacred Heart Academy in 1993. She says she recalls the smell of the hot dogs the rink sold and how people who knew how to do tricks would skate in the center while everyone else completed revolutions on the perimeter. "The brown skates with the orange wheels," she says, "they were staples of your childhood."
Clarification: CubeSmart is the company that is expected to open where the Hot Skates roller rink has been in Lynbrook. An incorrect spelling of the name appeared in previous versions of this s

Full text: A Long Island summer day camp for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender kids and their supporters or children of LGBTQ+ parents is expanding to four weeks for the summer of 2019 and will now cater to children ages 10 to 17.
Camp Ga'avah launched during the summer of 2018 as a one-week program at the Henry Kaufmann Campgrounds in Wheatley Heights serving children 12 to 18. Ga'avah is Hebrew for pride, but campers don't have to be Jewish to attend.
"We had a great week last summer with nine kids," says Stephanie Abrams, director of development at the Friedberg JCC of Oceanside, which runs the program. "We've decided to move forward and do a four-week session from July 29 to Aug. 23."
Camp will run as two self-contained two-week sessions; campers can register for one or both. The price hasn't yet been determined, Abrams says. Campers will be grouped by age; the JCC is hoping for 30 campers in 2019.
Camp Ga'avah offers the traditional activities of a day camp - drama, sports, arts, trips, gaga. Swim will be optional. There also will be programming on relevant LGBTQ+ issues.
For more information or to register, call 516-634-4164 or visit friedbergjcc.org/camps.

LI kid loves thrill of whitewater rafting at Lake George

Full text: Have you ever thought about the thrill of being on the water, that thought of the waves and the water splashing your face?
Well, my favorite experience of the water is whitewater rafting. Whitewater rafting was one of the best experiences of my life. My favorite part was when I got to sit in the front of the boat and we got to a huge wave and all the water splashed in my face!
But there are some rules to follow to make sure you stay safe while having fun!
- Always wear a life vest or personal flotation device.
- Hold the paddle the proper way.
- Make sure you stay in the boat.
- Know the proper swimming techniques.
- Know the commands given to you.
- Don't panic if in danger.
- Listen to your guide on the raft and water.
Now let's get back into the fun stuff. I went whitewater rafting at Lake George upstate. It was so much fun and I want to do it again and again.
Here are some places around the country that have great whitewater rafting that are on my wish list: Green River in Colorado, Nenana River in Denali National Park, in Alaska, Salmon River in California, Chattooga River in North Carolina, and American River in Sacramento, California.
You will love rafting because you get time outdoors, see wildlife, spend time with loved ones and for the experience. Whitewater rafting is so much fun and could be the best getaway trip for your family.

How the Konami Code for video games works

Author: Palmisano, Santino

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 1986, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games were selling. The company Konami made games for the NES.
Konami had a special code, Konami Code, which was invented by Kazuhisa Hashimoto in 1986. This code was for the game Gradius. When gamers had trouble on a level, they could use this code in the game to unleash an unfair reward such as 50 lives to help them with the game, but it would work only once. For example: Let's say you're playing Castlevania and you're stuck on a level. Just use this code in the game to grant you 50 lives.
This code worked only for Konami Games such as Contra, Gradius and Castlevania. Konami makes more games today, and the code is still available to use. This code was also referenced in the movie "Wreck It Ralph." The Konami Code goes by many names, including Contra Code and Thirty Lives Code.
Sometimes there are ways to cheat in a video game without this code. In Super Mario Bros., you can find a certain room to let you skip levels. In Mega Man X, you can unlock a secret attack that defeats bosses with one hit.
But it can sometimes backfire. When you have such an advantage, it does not make the game enjoyable or a real challenge, and it can sometimes break or cause a glitch in the game you are playing. So be careful when you cheat in a video game. I have tried this code out on my NES Classic. It has given me 50 lives - I know it works.

Full text: Social media is the hottest thing, and it seems almost everyone uses it. The most common social media are Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter. We have these apps. There are great things about these social media and bad things.
There can be bullying on social media. There are ways to help stop a bully or to stop bullying. One way is to block that person. Let's say someone puts a comment on your post that really hurts your feelings. You tell them to stop, but they might just keep doing it. There is always a way to stop the person from writing mean comments: Block that person. Blocking a person on a social media platform is taking them away from your page. Taking them away from your page means they won't be able to post mean comments or hurt you in any way.
Another way to stop these bullies is to confront them. By confronting you can reply to their comment and tell them what they are doing is wrong. You can also tell a parent. Telling someone can help you with the problem.
There is also something called "report" or "flag it" on some social media. They both help the app tell which person to ban or give a warning to, such as telling this person what they are doing wrong. Flagging is a little different from reporting someone. When you are reporting someone, you must give a report about this person and explain what they are doing. Flagging is just pressing a flag and picking from a list what they are doing. You can choose bullying, copyright, acting weird and more.
These are some ways to stop bullying. You can also go to the National Bullying Prevention Center for more ideas: nwsdy.li/pacerbully

Full text: A visitor to a Rockville Centre school who said he wanted to pick up his grandson Monday responded to an employee's request for ID by saying he was going to get it - and a gun - from his car, Nassau police said.
The man arrived about 5 p.m. at the Pre-K & Kindergarten Center #6 in Oceanside and was advised by a district employee to show identification, police said.
When he came back from his car, he continuously pressed the school's doorbell and covered the security camera with his hand, frightening the staff, who called police, authorities said.
An investigation led to the arrest of Kenneth Geller, 72, of Hendrickson Avenue in Rockville Centre. Police said he was issued a May 23 appearance ticket on a charge of third-degree falsely reporting incident.

LI kids like Silver Point club in Atlantic Beach

Full text: Silver Point is a beach club located in Atlantic Beach. It is a fun place to go. Silver Point has many different places to go. You can eat in the cafeteria, play video games in the game room, and swim in the pool and the ocean, but we'll get more into that later. It has lockers if you need to store something small, and there are cabanas if you want to store something big. I would recommend a cabana because if you like to play in the sand, there is more room by the cabana.
The cabanas have lots of room in them. They have sinks, cabinets and TV, and some have showers. The cabanas are big enough that we share with our friends.
Once a summer, each court has a court party. The court parties have music, cotton candy and even snow cones. The snacks are amazing, but when the snacks are gone there is even more stuff to do. The DJ plays music really late, and you hang out with friends.
The game room is a fun place to go if you want to get candy or play games. There are games like the claw, Pac-Man, pool and tabletop hockey. You can go to the game room if you are bored or want to hang out with friends.
They even have a camp. The staff is so nice. They have awesome activities such as color games, Olympics and track meets. If you are not good at sports, they give you time to just play cards and hang out.
The cabana boys help you carry your bags if you need help. They also set up the little pools for the little kids. They are very helpful. They know where everything is. And they know every cabana lock combination.
Silver Point is a very fun place to go. My family can't wait to go every summer. Find out more at silverpointclub.com.

Our magnet collection draws out family memories

Full text: My family and I have a lot of collections. One of my favorites is our magnet collection. Wherever we go, we get a magnet and put it on our garage door. We have about 50 magnets from everywhere we've been. Our goal is to get a magnet from all 50 states. So far we have about 20.
We always have a great time deciding on which magnet to get. We normally take a family vote on which one we will select. If we go to different cities we tend to get more than one. If we can't decide, then we'll try to select one based on the things that we did there.
Some of my favorite magnets are from my family trips to the Statue of Liberty, Disney World, West Point and Niagara Falls. I favor these magnets because they are memories of my family's favorite trips. I also like magnets like our Lego Statue of Liberty and our picture frame from a hotel in Kentucky.
These magnets are a great collection of memories. We like looking at the magnets and talking about the many places we have been together.

President's bullying sets bad example

Full text: President's bullying sets a bad example
As a parent, grandparent and educator, I'm extremely concerned about the rhetoric coming out of the White House, especially from the president.
We work hard, on all grade levels, to eradicate bullying, cyberbullying and lying.
President Donald Trump recently called FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's wife a loser .
If the president can get away with it, why can't the teen next door? If the president can bully people via Twitter, why can't the high school student down the block do the same? Media throughout the nation have reported the various lies uttered by the president and his staff.
It used to be that the president of the United States was a unifier and an example of appropriate decorum.
I fear the change in our children if the president continues to act counter to the what we are trying to teach.

Full text: Two Long Islanders are on board for the new season of Bravo's reality TV series "Below Deck Mediterranean."
Kasey Cohen, who grew up in Oceanside, and Colin Macy-O'Toole, who captains a ferry to and from Fire Island, will appear in season 3 of the show that chronicles the work hard, play harder activities of a group of 20-somethings who work on a luxury boat. In the new season, which begins May 15, Cohen is a third stew and Macy-O'Toole is a deckhand aboard the superyacht Talisman Maiton.
Though not experienced in the world of boating, Cohen competed in many pageants, was a straight-A student in high school and has a bachelor's degree in psychology, according to the network.
Macy-O'Toole, however, began his seafaring career as a deckhand and is described by the network as "a quintessential mama's boy" who likes to make people laugh.
In addition, Dr. Francis Martinis, a urologist from Fort Salonga, and his wife, Jessica, appear as charter guests on the May 22 episode.
Cohen and Macy-O'Toole are not the first Long Islanders to set sail on "Below Deck." In 2016, David and Jodi Mahler of Bellmore appeared as charter-yacht guests on an episode.

Full text: Everyone takes tests, right? But do you always check your answers, or do you think your first is better?
I expected more kids to say they would leave their answer. I was wrong. More kids say that they always check their answer. Below are my results:
Check answer:
42
Leave answer:
22
After I finished the survey, I interviewed a few kids from each grade to share with me their responses to the survey. Here's what they said:
Max said, "I always check my work because I always want to be sure all of my answers are correct."
Victoria said, "I always check my work because I always want to get 100 percent on all my tests and make sure I'm correct."
"I chose my answer because you have to take more time and I want to finish my work quickly," Tyler replied.
It is always good to double-check," Joey said. "I do not always check my answers because if I check my answers, I will not have time to do what I want."
As you can see, each kid had his or her own unique answer.

District Court judges, who have six-year terms, preside over cases involving violations of local ordinances, small claims and housing disputes. They also handle misdemeanor criminal cases and traffic cases in Nassau.
Six candidates, including District Court Judge Gary Knobel of Oceanside, were competing for three open seats. Knobel, a Republican; attorney Gary Carlton of Valley Stream, a Democrat; and attorney Geoffrey Prime of South Floral Park, a Democrat, were unsuccessful in their bids.

Full text: An Oceanside man who was among dozens of motorcycle operators doing dangerous stunts and defying police on Nassau County highways in July has been arrested, Nassau County police said.
Dean Wroblewski, 25, was arrested Thursday and was awaiting arraignment Friday in First District Court in Hempstead, police said.
Shortly after 6 p.m. on July 18 in Seaford, "a patrol officer observed dozens of motorcycles traveling eastbound on Sunrise Highway . . . stopping traffic while performing dangerous stunts," police said in a news release.
The group then headed north on the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway, "and was observed by responding officers driving in a reckless manner," police said.
"Officers activated emergency lights and attempted to initiate a traffic stop. Two of the operators positioned their motorcycles to box the officer in, preventing the traffic stop," the news release said.
"The male operator of a red Kawasaki continued to commit numerous VTL infractions while refusing to pull over for police," the release said.
Police did not say what led them to Wroblewski, but said that he was riding the red Kawasaki.
Wroblewski was charged with obstructing governmental administration, unlawful fleeing of a police officer, reckless driving and 24 vehicle and traffic violations, police said.

LIRR needs better communication

Full text: LIRR needs better communication
Regarding "Taking commuters for a ride" , has it ever occurred to the Long Island Rail Road that providing accurate and timely information to customers boarding and exiting trains would reduce delays?
Why not make announcements on the platforms, before trains pull into the station, about which cars are less crowded? Many announcements on the trains cannot be heard because the public address systems are poor.
Jerry Romano, Sea Cliff
-
After riding the Long Island Rail Road daily for more than 16 years, I'm still surprised by the ineptitude and laissez-faire attitude. During a recent week, there were rush-hour delays three days out of five.
You can try blaming Amtrak, but the reality is the entire LIRR system is poorly managed.

DA: Man gets 20 years in fatal Long Beach party shooting

Author: Irizarry, Lisa

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Long Beach man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison and 5 years of post-release supervision for fatally shooting another man at a party in a dispute over a woman, prosecutors said Thursday.
Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas announced the Wednesday sentencing in the 2014 incident in a news release.
Antonio Webb, 25, pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon during a March 6 trial before acting Supreme Court Justice Teresa Corrigan, prosecutors said.
"This defendant's unconscionable recklessness cost a man his life and left his two young children without a father," Singas said in a statement. "I have said it time and time again - gun violence will not be tolerated in our communities - and we will vigorously prosecute these senseless crimes. I hope this sentence provides some measure of comfort to Mr. Brown's family."
Singas said that on Sept. 27, 2014, at about 12:40 a.m., a group of people were gathered at a tattoo party at the Channel Park Homes near 5 Birch Court in Long Beach. After an altercation between two other men, Webb, armed with a pistol, fired several times into the group.
Webb shot Long Beach resident Tyrenzo Brown, 28, multiple times and the victim was taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, where he was pronounced dead from the gunshot wounds, Singas said.
Singas added the shooting was the result of a dispute between Webb and a friend of the victim over a woman.
Webb was found in the same housing complex where the shooting occurred and was arrested Oct. 1, 2014, by members of the Nassau County Police Department Homicide Squad and Long Beach Police Department following a chase.
During the trial Webb's attorney, Jeffrey Groder of Mineola, told jurors there was no forensic evidence linking Webb to the killing and that they were relying on testimony from witnesses who could not be trusted.

Middle and working classes anxious again

Full text: Middle and working classes anxious again
Am I to believe that a budget that is to cut food stamps, Medicaid, federal employee pensions, welfare benefits and farm subsidies will "Make America great again" ?
Was the rush to repeal Obamacare, with its many faults and a few positives, for something far worse, an effort to be proud of?
Is the enforcement of immigration policies - not tempered by restraint to avoid tearing apart families who have contributed to our society in a positive way - good for our nation?
When you have an administration of millionaires and the well-heeled, the empathy and compassion switch is turned off.
President Donald Trump received many crossover votes because people were tired of the same old spinning of the wheels.
Unfortunately, we are turning back to the increase of financial anxiety the middle and working classes have experienced since 2008. The light at the end of the tunnel is fast turning into an oncoming train.

Full text: Three men and a teenage girl used pepper spray and baseball bats in assaulting two men Sunday afternoon in an East Rockaway park, Nassau County police said.
Brandon Battaglia, 18; Robert Battaglia, 18; Avante Lester, 24, all of East Rockaway; and Kristin Milbank, 16, of Oceanside, were charged with assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the attack, police said.
Milbank, who police said had brass knuckles and a knife, was also charged with an additional count of criminal possession of a weapon and possession of noxious material.
Police said the four, along with others they are still looking for, surrounded their victims, 18 and 19, on Marjorie Lane in Bay Park. They sprayed pepper spray in the men's eyes and began hitting one of them on the head and body with bats while punching and kicking him, police said.
The attackers ran away but Fourth Precinct officers arrested them in the area shortly after the 2:25 p.m. assault, police said.
One of the victims was hospitalized with cuts to his head, concussions and bruising. The other, who was only pepper sprayed, refused medical attention at the scene.
A police spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of suspects at large or on a possible motive for the attack.
The four defendants were scheduled to be arraigned Monday in First District Court, Hempstead.

Hackers steal customer information from 22 LI Chipotle locations

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hackers stole customer payment data from 22 Chipotle Mexican Grill locations on Long Island as part of a breach that affected most of the chain's roughly 2,250 restaurants, the company said.
Chipotle could not say how many customers were affected by the malware attack, company spokesman Chris Arnold said via email Tuesday. The chain announced details of the security breach, which took place between March 24 and April 18, on Friday.
The restaurants were "using terminals that read the magnetic strips of cards," not the new chip card reader technology, Arnold said.
An investigation found the malware searched for data from the magnetic strips; many newer cards are equipped with microprocessor chips that make it harder for consumers' information to be stolen while they're making a payment.
Arnold noted the chip technology "does not stop malware," adding that Chipotle continues to look for "ways to enhance our security measures."
James Taliento, CEO of Huntington-based cybersecurity company Cursive Security, said chip readers would not have prevented the malware attack, but that they are "more secure" and could have "probably" protected the payment card data, depending on the sophistication of the malware.
"Chipotle should absolutely use technology," he said.
Stolen data included account numbers and internal verification codes.
The information could be used to drain debit card-linked bank accounts, make "clone" credit cards, or buy items on certain less-secure online sites, said Paul Stephens of the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.
Long Island locations affected include Carle Place, Deer Park, Farmingdale, Garden City, Great Neck, Hauppauge (both locations), Hicksville, Huntington Station, Lake Grove, Lawrence, Levittown, Merrick, Mineola, New Hyde Park, Oceanside, Riverhead, Selden, Syosset, Uniondale, Valley Stream and Wantagh.

Full text: Temperatures across Long Island will fall slightly on Sunday and into the early parts of this week, but there also will be an almost constant chance of rain during the next few days, forecasters said.
News 12 Long Island meteorologist Matt Hammer said Sunday "is not a washout," but rather "partly sunny with a chance of a leftover shower very early," with temperatures in the low 80s - close to normal for this time of year.
On Sunday and Monday, there will be chances of showers, said Brian Ciemnecki, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton.
Temperatures on Sunday will be in the lower 80s and perhaps even the upper 70s on the East End. Ciemnecki added that winds will come out of the east at around 5 to 10 mph.
"It's just going to be a cloudy day," he said. "Not a good beach day."
Ciemnecki said that on Monday, "we're again looking at a chance of a thunderstorm or showers," with the same temperatures across Long Island as Sunday.
Hammer said the possible rain this weekend will come at the most opportune time.
"The rain over the weekend will be coming at a good time - at night - not when we're all out doing things," he said.
Ciemnecki said Saturday that the upcoming week will be dry except for Thursday and Friday, when the chances of showers return.
Saturday was a muggy day on Long Island, with highs at 86 degrees.

Top-ranked Adelphi women dominate season opener: Rachel O'Brien opens campaign with career-high eight points Jacqueline Jahelka nets five; seven players score goals

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
The Adelphi women's lacrosse team boasted a high-octane offense in midseason form in the season opener on Saturday afternoon.
The Panthers, the top-ranked team in Division II, routed No. 15 Grand Valley State, 16-6, in a neutral site contest in Lakeland, Florida.
Senior Rachel O'Brien, a former Bayport-Blue Point standout, notched a career-high eight points to lead all scorers. Her role was primarily that of facilitator, as she posted a game-high six assists (including the 100th of her career) along with two goals scored.
"They were playing a man defense," she said. "We were doing really well back-dooring them. By working the ball around and just keeping our heads up, we figured out how to crack their defense."
Jacqueline Jahelka (Garden City) found the back of the net a game-best five times. Rachel Aitkens (Whitehouse Station, N.J.) had three goals, with Michele Scannell (Smithtown East) and Kate Beier (West Islip) scoring two apiece. Danielle Montano (Oceanside) and Casey Zalewski (Wall, N.J.) also scored.
On the strength of a defense led by Kelly Osmulski (Summit, N.J.) and her three caused turnovers, the up-tempo Panthers offense created opportunity after opportunity.
Beier scored just 40 seconds into the game, setting the tone for a blistering offense that netted six more goals (four by Jahelka) before the Lakers scored twice.
Adelphi went into the half with a commanding 10-3 lead. Scannell scored twice within 20 seconds in the second half, extending the lead to 12-4.
"We got contributions today from a lot of people," coach Pat McCabe said. "It's a good sign that we can put a lot of people on the field and have them produce." - Kenny DeJohn

'Hero' nanny pushes stroller away as car hits her, cops say

Abstract: [...]he said, the driver will not be charged.

Full text:   A 62-year-old Oceanside nanny saved the baby boy she was caring for by pushing his stroller out of the way of an oncoming vehicle Thursday afternoon in Rockville Centre, authorities said.
The woman, who is being treated at South Nassau Communities Hospital, is in a medically induced coma, Lt. James Vafeades of the Rockville Centre Police Department said.
"Witnesses said she pushed the baby out of the way and took the hit," Vafeades said of the nanny, calling her a hero.
Vafeades said he is usually reluctant to use the term "hero" as it can be overused, but added that it applies in this case.
"I was skeptical, but - and this is not coming from the cops, but from witnesses - she really pushed that baby out of the way," he said.
The child, a 9-month-old boy, was unharmed. His stroller came to rest safely at a curb. Paramedics examined him at the scene.
The crash occurred around 2:48 p.m., he said.
The nanny, whose name was not released, was pushing the stroller north on Hempstead Avenue when she was hit by a woman making a left turn at a green light at North Village Avenue.
The nanny had the right of way, Vafeades said. The driver was supposed to yield to pedestrians, "but it's not criminal," he added.
As a result, he said, the driver will not be charged.

Abstract: At his arraignment Monday in First District Court in Hempstead, Xiao was ordered held on $10,500 cash bail or $21,000 bond, and a temporary order of protection was issued.

Full text:   A woman suffered second-degree burns to both her hands when they became immersed in a deep-fat fryer during an argument with her husband in front of their children at the family's Oceanside restaurant Sunday night, Nassau police said.
The incident began as an argument between the woman and her husband, Xiuling Xiao, as the two worked at their Chinese restaurant, police said.
But Xiao then grabbed his 39-year-old wife "by the hair" shortly after 8 p.m. and pushed her toward the deep-fat fryer - causing "both of her hands to become immersed in the boiling oil," according to police.
The couple's two children, ages 12 and 14, were at the scene but were not injured.
Xiao, 39, of Massachusetts Avenue in Island Park, was arrested and charged with first-degree assault, second-degree attempted assault and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.
At his arraignment Monday in First District Court in Hempstead, Xiao was ordered held on $10,500 cash bail or $21,000 bond, and a temporary order of protection was issued. He is due back in court on Wednesday.
The woman, whose identity was not released, was brought to a hospital for treatment of her burns, police said.
Police did not release the name of the restaurant.

Memorial Day parade in Montauk again canceled by organizer: Growing crowds, traffic cited Flag raising ceremony planned

Author: Will, James

Abstract: Walles said the community will mark the holiday by again hosting a sunrise flag raising ceremony May 30 on the Village Green, attended by Coast Guard personnel, police officers, firefighters and Boy Scouts.

Full text:   Montauk will host a Memorial Day flag raising ceremony, but will forgo a parade for the second year in a row due to a growing influx of tourists, revelers and traffic, an organizer said.
Ken Walles, owner of the Oceanside Beach Resort in Montauk, said he put together a Memorial Day parade for several years but stopped last year because the hamlet had grown too crowded on the holiday weekend.
"We just saw the influx of business and problems," Walles said Wednesday. "The police department and fire department had enough on their hands."
Montauk has undergone a rapid transformation in recent years, from a haven for fishermen, surfers and vacationers into a Hamptons-style resort community. The crowds of tourists frequenting new bars and restaurants has roiled some locals, who have complained about drunken behavior and the changing character of the hamlet.
Walles said the parade could return someday if conditions change in the hamlet.
Montauk's parade also conflicted with an annual art show on the Montauk Village Green during the holiday weekend, Walles said.
"It just got so congested, and it wasn't fair to the veterans," he said.
Walles said the community will mark the holiday by again hosting a sunrise flag raising ceremony May 30 on the Village Green, attended by Coast Guard personnel, police officers, firefighters and Boy Scouts.
At sunset, the flag will be lowered and retired flags dropped off by residents will be burned on the Village Green. Walles said Montauk's flag ceremonies have been a tradition for about eight years. He said he expects the flag raising ceremony to begin about 8 a.m. Memorial Day and the flag retirement ceremony about 7:30 p.m.

Full text:   A man may lose his legs after being pinned between two vehicles on the Southern State Parkway in Malverne on Friday, a crash that shut down the eastbound lanes for more than five hours, state police said.
He was undergoing surgery at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside late Friday night and was in stable condition, police said.
He and another motorist had gotten out of their vehicles just before 5:35 p.m. after a minor collision by Exit 17 and were discussing the crash when another vehicle crashed into one of their cars, police said.
The first two vehicles were stopped just after a crest in the roadway and it's likely the third driver did not see them in time, police said.
It did not appear the other drivers were injured, police said.
The parkway was reopened just before 11 p.m.

I'm a sucker for a pretty tin, but the contents of Trader Joe's new extra-virgin Laconia Greek olive oil, made from hand-picked Athinolia and Koroneiki olives, is every bit as impressive as the striking black-and-yellow package. Laconia, the region of the Peloponnese peninsula that includes ancient Sparta, is known for its olive oil, and this unfiltered elixir - from the most recent olive harvest in the fall of 2015 - is mildly fruity and mellow. The 1.5-liter (51-ounce) tin is $9.99, and supplies won't last much more than a month. At Trader Joe's in Lake Grove, Commack, Plainview, Garden City, Merrick, Oceanside and Hewlett.

More than 1,500 in U.S. file as presidential candidates: Nineteen infinitely-long-shots hail from Long Island

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
As presidential primaries begin today in Iowa, voters select from more than a dozen candidates. But the field is actually much bigger: 1,561 people have filed statements of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission (there were 420 in 2012).
This year 105 New Yorkers - 19 from Long Island - entered their names. They won't appear on New York's ballot because they'd need to file 15,000 signatures to qualify. Most are independents or third-party candidates. Christin Noel Griskie of Centerport filed in 2012 and 2016 - this year, as both a Democrat and Republican.
Others are jokes: Zibble the Puppet from Oceanside, for one.

Abstract: Jordan McLune gained 214 yards on 19 carries and scored four touchdowns as the No. 2 Dalers beat No. 3 East Meadow, 41-13, last night in a Nassau I semifinal at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium.

Full text:   When Farmingdale needs big yardage, its rules are simple: Ground Jordan.
Jordan McLune gained 214 yards on 19 carries and scored four touchdowns as the No. 2 Dalers beat No. 3 East Meadow, 41-13, last night in a Nassau I semifinal at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium.
Farmingdale (10-0) will face No. 1 Oceanside (10-0) at 4 p.m. Saturday at Hofstra.
McLune was solid all night - and he was spectacular on an 82-yard scoring scamper that showed off his speed and exceptional cutting ability. That run came with 3:27 left.
The Dalers expanded a 21-13 halftime lead with an eight-play, 77-yard drive capped by McLune's 4-yard run. His 42-yard run highlighted the drive.
McLune has 1,747 yards and 31 touchdowns this season. His running mate, junior Kevin Eversley (75 yards, 12 carries) scored his second touchdown on a 5-yard run to make it 34-13.
It was the 238th victory of Farmingdale coach Buddy Krumenacker's career, breaking a tie for fourth place in Long Island history with his former coach and mentor at Farmingdale, Don Snyder, who coached at Farmingdale from 1953-92. Krumenacker played center and was a co-captain of the 1964 Dalers for Snyder, who watched last night's game from the press box.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
SAN DIEGO - A San Diego-area woman is working to honor the memory of a stranger who died hours after he paid for her groceries and asked her to "pay it forward."
Matthew Jackson, of Oceanside, Calif., was killed in a crash on Nov. 11, less than 24 hours after he met Jamie-Lynne Knighten, KNSD-TV in San Diego reported.
Knighten was ahead of Jackson in line to pay for her groceries with her crying infant when her card was declined. That's when Jackson stepped up and offered to foot the bill, which came to more than $200.
The 28-year-old wanted one thing in return.
"As long as you promise to do it for somebody else," Jackson said, according to Knighten.
Later, Knighten called his employer, a local gym, to praise Jackson - only to find out he had died when a car he was in struck a tree.
As a person of faith, Knighten said she believes Jackson didn't die in vain. She said she is working to further honor the man's legacy and is encouraging others to pay it forward.

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
Regarding the problem of battery disposal, Nassau County has had a STOP program - which stands for Stop Throwing Out Pollutants. Several times a year, residents and business owners can bring aerosol cans, car and appliance batteries, drain cleaners, waste oil, latex and oil-based paints, and many other pollutants to various collection points for safe disposal.
The writer should check with the Town of Oyster Bay to see if it has have a similar program.

I agree that we must do a better job at keeping toxic materials out of our water supply. There are a great many recycling drop-off points to help.
Best Buy, Lowe's, Home Depot, Staples, Office Max and Rite Aid are just a few that participate. Scrap yards are also an alternative. A quick Google search can identify many locations.
Weekly recycling pick-ups will not take batteries because they are not equipped to handle the heavy metals and acids that may be in the batteries. Ink and toner cartridges, and electronics are also items that should be kept out of the trash stream.

CALIF. MAN SOUGHT IN NASSAU KILLING: ALLEGEDLY SHOT ESTRANGED WIFE'S BOYFRIEND IN HER HOME

Abstract: Deon Ewers, 50, of Los Angeles, fled the rental home at 26 East Hawthorne Ave. after shooting the victim multiple times with a semiautomatic handgun, police said.

Full text:   A California man fatally shot his estranged wife's boyfriend early yesterday in a bedroom of her Valley Stream home, Nassau County police said.
Deon Ewers, 50, of Los Angeles, fled the rental home at 26 East Hawthorne Ave. after shooting the victim multiple times with a semiautomatic handgun, police said.
Authorities were continuing to search for Ewers last night.
"This is a targeted event, and not a random event," said Det. Lt. Richard LeBrun.
Ewers' 53-year-old wife and their 14-year-old son were inside the home at the time of the shooting shortly before 7 a.m., but neither was injured, police said.
She called 911, and responding officers found the 34-year-old victim in a second-floor bedroom, according to police.
The victim, who has not been identified, was taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside where he was pronounced dead about an hour later, police said.
He was visiting the home at the time of the shooting and had been dating Ewers' wife, police said.
Ewers and his wife married on May 8, 1991, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, records show.
About three years ago, police were called after the couple had an argument at the Valley Stream home, authorities said.
LeBrun said the couple separated about a year ago and, records show, Ewers later moved to California. Authorities believe Ewers flew to Long Island on Thursday night.
Ewers "should be considered armed and dangerous," LeBrun said.
Police would not discuss a motive or say how Ewers gained access to the home. He has no prior criminal record, police said.
Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-244-8477. All calls will be kept confidential.

Full text: An emergency room nurse from Bayport said she was hit by "an unbelievable, overwhelming feeling of love" Sunday when her sisters threw a drive-by parade to thank her and her co-workers for battling coronavirus.
Abigail Desmond, who works at Long Island Community Hospital in East Patchogue, said the parade brought tears to her eyes after two months of seeing "more devastating things than people should see in their lifetimes."
"It means the world to us," Desmond, 26, said. "We don't feel like heroes. We're doing our jobs, but we're really grateful for the support of the community."
At least two dozen cars streamed past Desmond's home Sunday, with family and friends inside the cars shouting "thank you" as Desmond and her five ER co-workers watched from the lawn. Some loved ones stopped to give gifts, including Dunkin' Donuts gift cards.
One of Desmond's older sisters, Maggie Desmond, roller-bladed around in a shirt that said "Fix your ponytail and handle it" while waving a white flag saying thank you. And Desmond's daughter, Hailey Rose, 8, made a sign for the house saying, "Thank you to the healthcare workers."
Maggie Desmond and another sister, Beth Lynch, said they organized the parade after hearing what their sister and her co-workers went through during the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations and "how they put so much of themselves into it."
"They might not think they're heroes but we think they are," said Maggie Desmond, 32, an architect who lives in Oceanside. "They have pushed themselves beyond anything we can comprehend."
Abigail said she believes her sisters felt they needed to cheer her up. She had reached out to them for support as she felt "suffocated" by "fear, anxiety and grief from all the people we lost" for the last two months. It didn't help that Desmond couldn't see their new babies  because of social distancing.
"My sisters saw that change in me," she said. "They needed to see me smile."
The two sisters initially planned the parade as a surprise just for Abigail, but once their father accidentally spilled the beans, Abigail said she asked that the parade also celebrate her co-workers, whom she called her best friends.
She invited fellow ER nurses Courtney McElhone, Stephanie Costa, Jimena Vera, Michelle Farid and Tatianna Young over for breakfast before the parade. They spent time together afterward, discussing how they could not have gotten through this crisis without each other to lean on.
"We're so close and this has brought us even closer," Desmond said.
Much of that crew spoke to Newsday last month about the emotional, physical and mental toll of working amid the pandemic.
Young said the parade came after "a hard couple of months for us."
"We've seen some terrible things so we're just grateful," Young, 27, of East Moriches said. "Our hearts are ful

'Maniac' worth the trip

'Maniac' is now streaming on Netflix.
By
Verne Gay
verne.gay@newsday.com
Owen Milgrim (Jonah Hill), son of a wealthy industrialist, is a depressed schizophrenic who hears voices and sees imaginary people. Annie Landsberg (Emma Stone) is also desperate and damaged and wants to mend a fractured relationship with her sister and mother, both dead. These two tragic souls find their way to Neberdine Pharmaceutical and Biotech, a giant and somewhat sinister Big Pharma company that's testing a drug (or series of them) that promises pure happiness. Both strangers, Owen and Annie join the trial, then discover, mostly during dream states, that they have a mysterious connection. The inventor of these pills - which put recipients into deep dreams - is one Dr. James K. Mantleray (Justin Theroux). There's something off about him and something really off about his mother, celebrity shrink Dr. Greta Mantleray (Sally Field).
This 10-parter - based on a Norwegian series - was created by novelist Patrick Somerville ("The Universe in Miniature in Miniature") and directed by Cary Fukunaga ("True Detective"). Parts were shot in Valley Stream and Oceanside.
MY SAY To orient you - and you'll need lots of orienting with "Maniac" - the Long Island episode arrives just before midpoint, or the fourth one. It features the Long Island that the rest of the world sometimes sees, or at least Hollywood does, of malls, traffic, big hair, mullets and thick Lawn Guyland accents. A ringtailed-lemur from Madagascar assumes a starring role. So do some locked-and-loaded agents from the Fish and Wildlife Service who are more aligned with the Gestapo than a benign federal agency. "Linda was from Long Island," Annie later recalls when she's awake. "I could smell her perm."
Funny, sure, but more absurd than funny and more psychotropic than absurd. That's par for the crazy course in "Maniac." Everything else is too.
"Maniac" is Pynchonesque only in the sense that there really is no other word to adequately describe the free flow of tangents, associations and allusions in this series, each drawing viewers down some rabbit hole where they all become curiouser and curiouser. Why Long Island? Maybe in homage (Thomas Pynchon is from Glen Cove, after all). But the better question is why not?
Lots of disconnected places and things find their way into "Maniac." Lots of seemingly disparate cultural touchstones, or hints of them, do as well: "Lord of the Rings," "Donnie Darko," "Dr. Strangelove," a few Coen brothers movies and a few seminal cyberpunk novel/movie/series ("Johnny Mnemonic").
"Maniac" might well be another one of those smarty pants postmodern TV series that like to show off - "Mr. Robot" Meets "The Leftovers" - or a sendup of them. Either way, it works well on both levels.
Mostly - and occasionally despite itself - "Maniac" is just fun, at points raucously funny. Most of the episodes unfold as dreams, where the narrative logic seems perfectly plausible, but the narrative elements are out of this world. In each Fukunaga has fused, or bridged, the divide so that they're recognizable, or as real as dreams get. These episodes also seem to get at a profound truth, that dreams are simply stories we tell ourselves about ourselves - an act of simulated reality that can sometimes seem more real than the waking world. At least the crazy dreams of "Maniac" have that quality.
To enjoy this you'll need to submit to "Maniac's" many peculiarities, but those are part of its charm - arguably all of its charm. These include: "Gerty," the pink, passionate, deeply feeling, deeply manipulative supercomputer, Theroux's Mantleray, a cyber-auto-eroticized wacko with mommy issues, and - most of all - Hill's Owen and Stone's Annie. They've been destined to be together since the Big Bang. They're also wonderful, memorable and terribly (terribly) sad.

SETAUKET: FIRE OFFICIALS EYE ALTERING 4 JOB TITLES

Full text: Setauket fire officials have proposed changing the job titles of four paid employees so that they can fight fires without violating civil service laws.
The department has four fire protection coordinators who perform tasks ranging from community relations to fire hydrant and commercial building inspections, district manager David Sterne said.
The coordinators have firefighting experience, but under state civil service law are not allowed to respond to calls, Sterne said. The district wants to change their titles to firefighter, he said.
"It's the same job," he said. "We're making sure that we're in full compliance with what civil service law would want to see."
The coordinators are paid $27 an hour and usually work no more than 20 hours a week, Sterne said. They would not receive a raise if the board of commissioners approves their new job titles, he said.
Paid firefighters would work at the firehouse during daytime, weekday hours, "when we are most busy with the least amount of people available," Sterne said. They would work in shifts, with three firefighters on duty at any given time, Sterne said.
Garden City fire officials last month voted to eliminate 11 paid firefighter positions amid a contract dispute, saving the department an estimated $2 million a year. That department has 100 volunteers. That action leaves Long Beach as the only Long Island municipality with a paid firefighting force.
Steven Klein, president of the Firemen's Association of the State of New York, said some Long Island departments use paid emergency medical technicians to supplement volunteers. Klein, a former Oceanside fire chief, said the firemen's association took no position on Setauket's proposal.
"With rising calls for both fire and EMS service, certain communities may feel the need to augment their volunteer staff with career firefighters," Klein said in a statement.
Sterne said Setauket started paying some EMS workers about 18 years ago because it is difficult for volunteers to leave their jobs and respond to calls during working hours. Setauket is planning to replicate that system to ensure firefighters are on call when they are needed, he said.
Setauket officials have no plans to eliminate volunteer firefighter positions, he said.
"We are in the same position on the fire side as we were with EMS 18 years ago," Sterne said. "Putting four people [on the payroll] does not put anybody out as far as volunteers."
The district will hold a public hearing on the change at 6 p.m. Thursday at fire department headquarters, 26 Hulse Rd., Setauket. The board plans to take a vote after the hearing,

LI fishing and Florence are a mixed bag

Full text: Fearsome Hurricane Florence may have missed Long Island by several hundred miles, but her high seas have stretched across the Atlantic Coast from Florida to New England. Following strong offshore winds that saw ocean swells topping 12 feet last weekend, the influence of the massive hurricane - plus the possibility of more heavy seas from two additional named storms now swirling in the Atlantic - have anglers wondering how the fishing might shape-up once the waves finally lay down.
Big storms can have a huge influence on Long Island's fishing prospects, especially during September when many local species like fluke, sea bass, porgies and weakfish begin transitioning from the bays and coastlines out to deeper ocean waters. Some anglers believe a heavy storm at this time of year can shut the action down for days or even weeks; others think just the opposite, feeling that rough seas and dropping temperatures may spark the start of a fall bite. Depending on the year and the storm, it's likely both camps are right some of the time.
"I'm worried that heavy seas and all the rain we've already had might slow the action for a few days," said Capt. Joey Leggio of the Oceanside charter boat Frankie James. "At the least, all this foul weather will push fish further offshore. Anglers have been catching brown sharks and even cobia - a southern visitor that loves warm water - in as little as 20 feet of ocean water. I'm pretty sure those fish will move deeper. Fluke might make an adjustment, too. The biggest ones are already in 60- to 80-foot depths. They might just keep on going. You just never know."
Ken Morse at Tight Lines Bait and Tackle in Sag Harbor was undecided. "Storms can be good to East End fishermen to a certain point," he explained. "An early fall nor'easter with gusts to 30 miles per hour could spur good surf fishing at Montauk. It might also draw stripers and false albacore to Shinnecock Inlet. Any storms that lower the temperature in September can also be helpful. They can really put some bite back into the fish during late summer."
On the flip side, adds Morse, the very same storms could clear the weakfish out of the Peconics. That would be a shame because the weaks have continued to feed with abandon in Noyack Bay.
Over on the North Shore, Phil McGowan at Cow Harbor Bait and Tackle in Northport thought the heavy rain earlier this week might help to lure more predator species to the western sector of Long Island Sound. "We've got plenty of bait around right now in the form of bay anchovies and bunker," he said. "A temperature drop might attract blues, false albacore and school stripers into our area."
McGowan noted that the Huntington area is somewhat protected from the rougher seas that anglers are seeing on the South Shore. "I don't think the hurricanes are likely to curtail the fishing here at all," he continued. "Any remnants coming up the coast would probably be helpful from a fishing standpoint."
At Captree Bait and Tackle, Brenden Rutigliano, hoped the storms wouldn't disrupt the fishing. "Right now, snappers, blowfish, kingfish and blue crabs are biting well from our dock," he said. "I'd like to see it stay that way."

Engineers wrap up construction work on Long Beach jetties: The next phase of the $250 million reconstruction project will include sand replenishment and building a 17-foot dune with walkovers and ramps

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed all its groins and jetties on the Long Beach shoreline, with plans for a quiet summer until work resumes in the fall.
Workers finished the first eight jetties in September. The remaining seven jetties were finished in the past six months, spanning from Point Lookout to Long Beach, covering seven miles of coastline in the first phase of a $230 million federally funded two-year project.
Workers have been cleaning up the beach, including repairing a groin in Point Lookout and removing any small stones or rocks left from the construction project. A sea wall and a handicap access ramp are also being replaced on Neptune Avenue that were taken down to allow trucks to pass and deliver stones during the jetties construction, Long Beach Public Works Director John Mirando said.
"You shouldn't see water lapping at the boardwalk any more," Mirando said. "The most disruptive part of this project is done. It doesn't add to the storm protection until sand replenishment is built."
Construction on the beach led to intermittent partial beach closures last year. The protective structures known as groins were built to trap sand and stabilize the beach from future erosion and tidal flooding.
The Army Corps and Long Beach officials started the project last year after decades of planning the storm protection project to prevent flooding and erosion on the Atlantic coast from future storms. Long Beach was inundated with flooding that destroyed the boardwalk during superstorm Sandy more than five years ago.
Beachgoers should be uninterrupted for Long Beach's peak summer season until work resumes in the fall for a sand replenishment project to pump sand back onto the beach. Sand is being collected from the ocean floor to maintain the same fine quality of sand on the existing beach.
The sand will be replenished off an oceanside barge, but pay loaders and vehicles will be adding sand to about 1,000 feet of beach per week during a 24/7 operation until the sand replenishment will be completed. Once completed, the coastline will be moved 50 to 75 feet away from where the tide currently comes in, Mirando said.
Next spring, the Army Corps expects to start work on building a 17-foot sand dune, parallel to the boardwalk, with walkovers and ramps built over the dune and down to the beach.
Bids for the sand replenishment and the dune walkovers were due last week, and a contract is expected to be awarded next month followed by a public hearing on the project expected in April.
"Everyone anticipates some adjustments to our normal routine," Long Beach City Council President Anthony Eramo said. "This is something we need. I thought residents were fine with most of the work and everyone's pulling through it together."

Uniondale's goal is clear: Make it down the block to Hofstra for playoffs

Abstract: When Phil Coppola points beyond the trees and houses that line Uniondale's practice football field and tells his players, "That's our goal," nothing gets lost in translation.

Full text:   When Phil Coppola points beyond the trees and houses that line Uniondale's practice football field and tells his players, "That's our goal," nothing gets lost in translation. The meaning is blatantly - even painfully - obvious.
Uniondale is 1 1/2 miles from Hofstra's Shuart Stadium, a distance so short the Knights could run there and hardly break a sweat. But since 2000, they've dropped pounds and pounds of collective water weight trying to get back there.
Returning to Hofstra, host of the county semifinals and final, is the goal.
"We see these other teams keep going into our house," senior lineman Magin Saravia said. "It's, like, down the block. We just get mad, like, how come I'm not there, how come we're not there, how come we're not good enough?"
But the belief around the program this year is that the Knights are good enough. Nassau Conference I coaches tabbed them sixth in the preseason, but Coppola's group returns a handful of starters from the 2015 playoff team and adds juniors and sophomores who went undefeated on JV.
"We gave Oceanside everything they could handle right up until the end ," Coppola said. "After that game, those kids, they felt it. They wanted more than a taste, so we want to take the next step."
With inexperienced quarterbacks Victor Torres and Rolando Meyers-Turner filling the position by committee, the Knights' offense will rely on Saravia, Jahmel Hinton, Terrell Cyrus and a deep line opening holes for the versatile backfield of Zach Knighton-Ward, Kendell Glynn and Roquise Bryant.
"We are going to be ground and pound, no doubt about it," Coppola said.
Defensively, Knighton-Ward and Glynn run the show at linebacker, but newcomers Danny Ashley and Jared Hardy have the potential to be shutdown corners on opposite sides of the field.
"We have a ton of talent in the secondary with Danny Ashley and Jared Hardy," Coppola said.
Those two were key players for last year's 8-0 JV squad. The infusion of young talent has given the Knights a boost.
"There's better energy within the team," Knighton-Ward said. "I can see that it's more disciplined. We're setting higher goals for ourselves, and we're working harder. We're persistent with what we're trying to do."
And that, of course, is reaching the semifinals.
"Hofstra's right down the block," Coppola said. "That's why I keep pointing and saying that's our goal, that's our goal. Honestly, if we don't get there, it's going to be a disappointment because we have the talent to do it."

Carvel, Dunkin' Donuts latest knife-point robberies, cops say

Abstract: Hours after Nassau County police released a video of a knife-wielding masked man suspected in a series of robberies, they think he struck again, knocking off a Carvel ice cream store in North Valley Stream on Tuesday night.

Full text:   Hours after Nassau County police released a video of a knife-wielding masked man suspected in a series of robberies, they think he struck again, knocking off a Carvel ice cream store in North Valley Stream on Tuesday night.
Nassau Det. Lt. Richard LeBrun said the man responsible for the robberies wields a kitchen knife that is 6 to 7 inches long.
"He demands cash, he flees," LeBrun said at a news conference at Nassau police headquarters on Wednesday.
He said police are dedicating a large number of resources to catching the robber, including members of the bureau of special operations and the criminal intelligence rapid response team.
"We're all on heightened alert. We're intensifying our patrols around the areas" where the robber has struck, LeBrun said.
He said the businesses hit were probably attractive targets to the robber because they are open late and have glass fronts, which allowed the thief to see inside.
That describes the Carvel at 1551 Dutch Broadway, one of nine places the man has hit over a six-week span, police said. It was robbed Tuesday about 9:30 p.m. and Major Case Bureau detectives said they are investigating.
Police released video Tuesday afternoon of what they believe is the first robbery, at a New Hyde Park Dunkin' Donuts shop on March 1.
In the Carvel robbery the man had a 6-inch knife and walked around the counter, demanding the clerk open a register, police said.
The suspect took an unspecified amount of cash and left, fleeing east on Dutch Broadway. The clerk was the lone employee and was not hurt, according to a news release.
The man was about 6 feet tall and wore a black hooded shirt, jeans, tan work boots, black gloves and dark glasses.
In previous robberies, the man was similarly described, including being between 25 and 30 years old and weighing about 170 pounds.
Police said the man in the video also had robbed a 7-Eleven in Bethpage, a Subway sandwich shop in North Merrick and five other Dunkin' Donuts stores - two in Plainview, one in East Meadow, one in Oceanside and one in Massapequa Park.
On Monday morning, police said they were trying to determine if the suspect also was responsible for the robbery of a Williston Park Dunkin' Donuts on April 8.
They have since ruled out his involvement, noting that the suspects' descriptions did not match, police said.
Anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers at 800-244-8477. All information will be kept confidential.

Businessowners, companies charged with labor crimes

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Business owners and corporations were charged Monday with what Suffolk County officials are calling “a crackdown of labor-related crimes,” with employees cheated of more than $250,000 in wages and benefits.
In addition, those charged were also accused of nonpayment of more than $58,000 to the New York State Department of Labor for unemployment insurance fund contributions, and nonpayment of more than $133,000 to the New York State Insurance Fund for workers’ compensation insurance premiums.
Some were also charged with the alleged illegal dumping of polluted water into a public storm water drain.
Suffolk District Attorney Tim Sini said in a statement that the county “will not tolerate the exploitation of workers or our taxpayers by greedy corporations and business owners.”
He said authorities are “aggressively identifying and prosecuting bad actors in the business community and holding them accountable. Indeed, not only will our efforts protect workers and taxpayers, they will also prevent these bad businesses from gaining an unfair competitive advantage against legitimate, law-abiding businesses.”
Robert Montgomery of Garden City and Dix Hills Brushless Car Wash are accused of paying “paying employees sub-minimum wages and failing to pay time and a half for extensive amounts of overtime hours worked,” according to a press release from the DA’s office.
Officials said that employees regularly worked more than 60 hours a week and were allegedly owed more than $180,000 for unpaid wages from 2014 to 2017. And Montgomery and his company allegedly falsely listed zero employees on forms to the Labor Department to avoid paying $29,000 in Unemployment Insurance Fund contributions.
But Montgomery’s attorney, Brian Giffin, told Newsday that he and his client “are confident that when additional compensation such as tips and car detailing are added to hourly pay, minimum wage will not just be met, it will be exceeded."
Montgomery was also accused of “illegally discharging the car wash runoff water from the collection tanks into the public storm water drains on Jericho Turnpike in Huntington, rather than having it pumped and carted away as required by the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation, according to the DA’s office.
Also charged were Andrew Woodstock, of Oyster Bay, and Woodstock Construction Group, for allegedly underpaying workers by more than $50,000, and failing to pay overtime.
But Woodstock’s attorney, Michael Grundberg, told Newsday that Woodstock and his company are "confident that in the end all the issues will be resolved in their favor."
Paul Gillistro, of Selden, and Goldstar Installation Services, are charged with misclassifying 12 employees as independent contractors to avoid paying the statutory prevailing wage on public works jobs performed. Gilistro is alleged to have regularly falsified the sworn certified payroll records he submitted to reflect the job classifications and wages the employees should have received.
Nicholas Guercio, of Brightwaters and Environmental Compliance Associates Corp. are charged with regularly falsifying the sworn certified payroll records he submitted to reflect the job classifications and wages the employees should have received.
Arsenio Carcamo, of Oceanside, and Answer Construction Corp. are charged with fraudulent practices against the State Insurance Fund. Officials say Carcamo fraudulently omitted his ownership of Answer Construction Corp. when applying for a workers’ compensation policy with the NYSIF. Prior to incorporating Answer Construction, Carcamo owned Multiwork Construction Corp., which has an outstanding balance of more than $17,000 with the NYSIF, therefore making him ineligible to take out a new policy, officials said.
Tosef Siddiqi, of Westbury, and Allstate Enterprises, Inc., are accused of submitting a forged performance bond to the Huntington Union-Free School District after winning the bid for its 2018 district-wide capital improvement project. They are also accused of failing to submit certified payrolls for their time on the project.
Alan James, of Saint James, and APJ Restoration, Inc., are each charged with fraudulent practices against the State Insurance Fund, in violation of New York State Workers Compensation Law.

Psychiatrist: 'Not a danger': D'Amato wasn't threat to herself or others, he says

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A psychiatrist who examined the estranged wife of former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato this fall testified in court Tuesday that she should not have been involuntarily hospitalized for three days in 2017 at South Nassau Communities Hospital.
Dr. Oliver L. Harper of Manhattan said he believed Katuria D'Amato, 53, was not suffering from psychosis and posed no danger to herself or others when Nassau police forced her to go to the Oceanside hospital  on Sept. 30, 2017.
Harper testified that he reached that conclusion based on his examination of Katuria D'Amato as well as his review of police reports and medical records, including documents from other mental health professionals who have treated her in the past.
However, Harper said he was reluctant to criticize the hospital psychiatrist  who initially admitted Katuria D'Amato for observation, Dr. Nnamdi Odiah. He said Odiah made his decision based on the information he had at the time and emergency room physicians often do not have a full picture about a patient's mental health.
"My opinion is that it was reasonable for Mrs. D'Amato to be involuntarily committed," Harper testified.
"It was a concern about safety," he later added. "We err on the side of caution."
But, he said, Katuria D'Amato should have been released the next day, Oct. 1, 2017, after doctors got a more complete picture of her mental health. "She was not a danger to herself or others," Harper said. "All the information available to me since then supports that."
His testimony came as the D'Amatos continue to battle for custody of their son, 10, and daughter, 9, with Katuria D'Amato again acting as her own attorney.
State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Lorintz had granted Alfonse D'Amato temporary custody of the couple's children in October after the former senator questioned Katuria D'Amato's mental stability.
The Republican power broker sought custody after Katuria D'Amato's 911 call in September 2017 about a possible home intrusion brought police to her Lido Beach home - an event that led to the couple's child custody and divorce case.
Nassau police have testified Katuria D'Amato was "delusional" and that she believed Alfonse D'Amato, 81, would let intruders who hid behind lasers into the residence.
Police also said she told them she hid in a closet and unsuccessfully tried to load a shotgun before calling 911 but couldn't find the key to the weapon's gunlock.
Alfonse D'Amato's attorney Stephen Gassman tried to chip away at Harper's testimony on cross-examination by getting Harper to acknowledge that he had not spoken directly with Nassau police officers who responded to Katuria D'Amato's 911 call or most of the mental health professionals who had treated her.
Gassman will continue his cross-examination when Harper returns to the court Jan. 24

LIers hold rally for NY gun laws

Full text: Gun control advocates and Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) rallied Saturday to urge the State Senate to pass a package of gun control measures.
The State Legislature, backed by a newly Democratic-controlled Senate, are expected to vote Tuesday on a wish list of gun control bills, including a "red flag" law to remove guns from those deemed at-risk, banning "bump stocks," prohibiting school staff from carrying guns and increasing background checks from three to 10 days.
Kaminsky has pushed for a bill banning teachers from carrying guns since last year when President Donald Trump suggested teachers should be armed in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, mass fatal shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
"We have a chance this week to enact common sense gun measures to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of dangerous people," Kaminsky said, referring to the wider legislation.
He met with supporters Saturday at the Oceanside Library along with Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder and Linda Beigel Schulman, the mother of Stoneman Douglas teacher Scott Beigel, who was among 17 people killed at the Parkland high school last Valentine's Day.
"I'm tired of politicians that offer only thoughts and prayers. That won't stop the killing of innocent lives," Beigel Schulman said. "I will celebrate when the red flag law is enacted in New York. No matter how senseless or incomprehensible Scott's murder was, it is now going to save lives."
Beigel described how her son was shot six times in three seconds with an AR-15 assault rifle as he tried to shield his students in his classroom. She said her son never worried about reaching for a gun and instead focused on teaching and protecting his students.
Nassau County police said they were working to increase response times to schools and adding rapid response panic button apps to dispatch police during active shooter situations.  
Ryder said police were focused on increasing security at schools with methods that did not include arming teachers.
"My job is to stay out of politics, but we have to take a stance. Our stance is for the safety of our children," the Nassau police commissioner said. "We're not for putting more guns in schools. We're for fortifying schools and getting us there

Nastro, 88, Happy Land responder: FDNY assistant chief among first on scene of 1990 Bx. fire that left 87 dead

Author: DeStefano, Anthony M

Publication info: AM New York ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]28 Feb 2019: 5.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Frank J. Nastro Sr. stared at the scores of what seemed to be peaceful dead people lying on the floor after a devastating fire at the Happy Land Social Club in the early morning hours of March 25, 1990. 
"They all could have been sleeping," Nastro remembered about the eerie scene years later.
Nastro was an assistant chief with the FDNY and one of the first senior commanders to arrive at the burned out club that horrible morning in the West Farms section of the Bronx. At first Nastro and other firefighters thought there were only two fatalities. But as additional calls came in the toll hiked to 24 and then rose to the unthinkable 87 souls, mostly immigrants from Central America. The victims' cause of death was determined to be smoke inhalation and asphyxiation.
Nastro, of Lynbrook, died Feb. 12 at age 88. The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said his daughter Elise Rosenberry of Albany.
Nastro stayed at the Bronx fire scene, directing firefighters to use decency and respect as they removed shrouded corpses from the two-story structure on Southern Boulevard and lay them out on the sidewalk before transferring them to mortuary vehicles. Happy Land is the site of the greatest loss of life in New York City fire since the Triangle Shirt Waist blaze killed 146 garment workers in 1911. 
Over the years, Nastro traveled around the country to speak to firefighter groups about the tragedy until he retired from the FDNY in 1994. He even published an article about the catastrophe in a firefighting journal.
"None were burned," Nastro wrote of the victims in the article in Fire Engineering. "The only indication of fire was the darkened skin and clothing were the soot fragments had settled."
Born in Brooklyn where he grew up in the Bay Ridge section, Nastro was the product of an Italian family which traced its roots to the city of Naples area, Rosenberry said. A vigorous, athletic young man, Nastro played football in high school and for the U.S. Marine Corp, which he joined during the Korean War era, his daughter said. He was selected for a special Marine football team that toured various military bases as a morale building exercise, she said.
After leaving the military in 1956, Nastro coached football at St. Francis Prep in Queens, leading the team to numerous championships. He joined the FDNY in 1957, rising through the ranks to the position of assistant chief. Nastro married Doris McMahon in February 1954 and, in 1961, the couple moved to Lynbrook. There the couple raised four children: Elise, Paul, Frank Jr. and Laura. While working with the FDNY, Nastro found time to return to school at St. John's University, where he earned a degree in athletic administration in 1973, according to death notice in Newsday.
After retirement, Nastro and his wife traveled in Europe and lived part time in their second home in Florida, Rosenberry said.
Although Nastro witnessed his share of tragedies as a firefighter, the Happy Land fire was certainly the worst, his daughter said. The experience put Nastro in demand on the firefighter speaking circuit, but at home he was more reserved about the tragedy.
"He wasn't the kind of person who would dwell on it," Rosenberry recalled. "He obviously was very affected by it but it was also part of his job and he was able to move on."
Nastro knew first responders would be affected by the great loss of life at Happy Land. To spare them the psychological trauma of handling so many dead, he divided the body removal task among different shifts of firefighters, his daughter said.
In addition to Elise Rosenberry and her husband, Doug, survivors include daughter Laura Nastro of Long Beach; sons Paul Nastro of Rockville Center and Frank Nastro and his wife, Nancy, of Oceanside; brother Daniel and his wife, Margaret of New Jersey; sister-in-law Maureen McMahon; and numerous grandchildren, nieces and nephews. His wife Doris Nastro died in January 2018.
A funeral Mass was celebrated Feb. 18 at Our Lady of Peace Roman Catholic Church in Lynbrook. Interment

Full text: The 70th annual Primetime Emmy Awards arrive Sept. 17, but this week I'll take a look at some of the nominees - the ones you may have overlooked. One slam-dunk winner: "GLOW," which recently launched a second season on Netflix and which also stars Oceanside native Jackie Tohn, as Melrose.
For those still wondering about "GLOW" - an Emmy nod for best comedy, and for co-star Betty Gilpin as supporting actress - let's take a moment to demystify this. It's a joyous, big-hearted romp through an '80s-era subculture of cheesy TV suffused with antediluvian values - sexist, racist, occasionally, or overtly, misogynistic ones. ("GLOW" is funny but not unserious, and the second season finds plenty of #MeToo and Time's Up tangents.)
But to love this show is to simply allow it to work its unique magic - for example, in the second season launch, that opening title sequence scene that Ruth (Alison Brie) shot at the mall, enlisting the help of a moonlighting security guard while Billy Joel's "You May Be Right" tracks. Who wouldn't love this scene? Who couldn't? Well, Sam (Marc Maron).
But I'm getting way ahead of myself: "GLOW's" about a struggling actress in '80s-era Hollywood - Brie's Ruth Wilder - who answers a casting notice seeking only women. Washed-up director Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron) is looking to launch an all-female wrestling series, "GLOW," for Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling. Ruth's pal and rival, Debbie Eagan (Gilpin), becomes a producer on this hunk of TV Velveeta. ("GLOW" is based on the mid-'80s syndicated hoot of the same name).
Co-creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch have avoided the easy temptation of turning this material into a running gag, or the characters into clowns. Instead, they have lives and back stories, tragedies and triumphs - mostly the former. To us, they've been consigned to the dark underside of an eat 'em up, spit 'em out industry. But to them, the show is a paycheck, a way out, a chance for glory or a chance for redemption. Where we see a farce, they see a wrestling version of  "Fame."
And while it may be hard to imagine Brie as a professional wrestler, even a fake one, that is one of the jokes, or the better part of one. With aspirations to "real" acting, she's very much into "method;" Sam in the first season took to calling her Uta Hagen, the famed acting teacher, but she likes to think of herself as Alma Hitchcock to Sam's Alfred Hitchcock.

DAN INGRAM | 1934-2018: INGRAM, 83, VOICE OF NEW YORK RADIO

Author: Gay, Verne

Publication info: AM New York ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]26 June 2018: 5.

Full text: Dan Ingram, the beloved disc jockey and voice of New York radio over a five-decade run, has died, according to reports, including by WCBS/101 FM, where Ingram had worked until his retirement in 2003. He was 83.
Long Island-born and raised, Ingram spent most of his career at WABC/770 AM during an era when AM radio commanded both listeners and cultural clout. Many New Yorkers were first introduced to The Beatles through "The Dan Ingram Show," heard for many years from 2 to 6 p.m., while Ingram and WABC's other so-called "All Americans" -- Ron Lundy, Harry Harrison, "Cousin Brucie" Morrow -- were New York-area icons and household names. For a time, Ingram was the most popular DJ in the United States and commanded as much as a quarter of the listening audience here.
With a style that was fast and fluid, Ingram also introduced an element to New York radio -- the wisecrack -- that branded each of the thousands of Top 40 songs he played with his own unique personality. Rather than simply spin a song, he'd occasionally talk over it, too, especially if the song was well-known. And in a rush of words that covered everything from the weather to the station call letters, he'd talk during the song's introductory bars before cutting out just as the first verse began. Ingram's so-called "talk-up" was widely copied during an era when most people heard popular music for the first time on AM radio.
Born in Oceanside in 1934, Ingram's parents were both musicians. His interest in show business began when he'd accompany his saxophonist father to sessions. After attending Hofstra University, Ingram joined a radio station in New Rochelle, but as he later recalled, "I worked there for two months in 1953 and I got a paycheck that bounced. When I went back to the sales manager, he thought it was terrible that I dared to challenge him, and there was an altercation after which I was either resigned, or I quit." After that, "I ran around to stations on Long Island and walked into WALK in Patchogue" where the station manager "still believed it was 1934, and was playing Benny Goodman. But he listened to my tape and signed me on New Year's Day, 1954."
Ingram later joined Connecticut stations WNHC in New Haven and WICC in Bridgeport .Those jobs led to the big breaks -- DJ jobs in Dallas (KBOX) and St. Louis (WIL), where he boosted listenership and his own profile. He was hired by WABC in 1961.
With Ingram as its star DJ, the station's longtime programming chief, Rick Sklar, launched a format of "only the biggest hits - rock, pop and Motown - in an up-tempo atmosphere sustained by high-octane disc jockeys," according to longtime Newsday radio columnist Paul Colford. "The catchy jingles came to be as memorable as the songs, and much-hyped contests, such as an annual principal-of-the-year election hooked teenagers.
Ingram's style was perfectly matched to Sklar's format: Loose, fast, funny and go-with-the-flow, wherever that flow might lead either Ingram or listeners. In 1965, Ingram led 10,000 Beatles fans who had gathered outside the studio on a sing-along of the station's indelible jingle ("seventy-seven . . . double-uuu-ABCCCCC!!!!") On Nov. 9, 1965, Ingram was on the air just as a blackout struck New York. As lights flickered in the studio, the song he was playing -- Jonathan King's "Everyone's Gone to the Moon" -- also began to slow down. As it ground to a halt, Ingram quipped "everyone's running at half speed here, including me," and "the equipment reads 'Signal Corps, 1902.'"
Ingram was the most popular DJ during AM radio's ascendancy in the '60s, while his popularity waned as FM's increased in the following decades. Nevertheless, when Ingram and Ron Lundy spun their last record on May 10, 1982 -- and WABC got out of the music business for good -- longtime fans lamented "the Day the Music died."
Ingram went on to build a national following as host of CBS Radio's "Top 40 Satellite Survey," then, as "Oldies" formats established a beachhead, he joined CBS in 1991 where he remained until retirement in 2003.
During a career retrospective at the Museum of Television and Radio in 2001, Ingram recalled that one of his most vivid memories from WABC occurred on his last day: "I got a letter, neatly typed, and in the middle paragraph, this person wrote that 'I was a battered child, and one day, standing on the Brooklyn Bridge with a transistor radio, you made me laugh, and I didn't jump.'
"Maybe that's what made it all worthwhile."

Full text: Why is Cuomo fixing Puerto Rico problems?
Almost six years later, we're still reading about people on Long Island suffering from the effects of superstorm Sandy. At the same time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is leading groups to Puerto Rico to help people there who are still suffering from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. He returned from another trip earlier this week.
While this is a worthy cause, isn't he obliged to take care of the people who elected him first? Where is the outrage?
Rich Corso,Oceanside
I get it, our governor had to fly to Puerto Rico to see what is going on down there. This was his fourth visit, and I feel sorry for all of those people. We all know it is an election year and he needs the votes, but he won't get mine. Long Island's infrastructure is awful.
Recently, I bounced over at least 50 poorly paved or patched parts of state Route 231, Deer Park Avenue, between North Babylon and Deer Park. We recently drove out to Bellport on state Route 27, Sunrise Highway. Good heavens, it is terrible. These road patches are jaw-breaking. I think we rattled a few bolts loose.
Get with the program, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Visit us, and take a ride on these roads to see what we put up with. Look at your own state and fix things here.
Diane Duguid,Deer Park
Conductors in 2018? Bring LIRR up to date
As a peak afternoon Long Island Rail Road train slowly moved away from Manhattan recently, I watched a conductor stand in a vestibule - not moving, not attempting to check tickets, not providing any additional services.
What was the value here?
In fairness, there wasn't much room to move, but how many fares went uncollected? How many people would use their tickets another day, costing the LIRR other fares? How much was the conductor paid for taking a train ride? How often does this happen, magnifying the effects of this one ride?
That last question I can answer. Often.
It's 2018. It's the age of driverless cars and unmanned trains. Why does the LIRR still have conductors? At what cost to commuters and the system?
Transit systems such as Seattle's rail network show that a high-volume, multi-zone system can be automated with minimal human interaction all while holding customers accountable.
It's time to end the use of conductors, and focus on saving the commuter time and money.

LONG ISLAND: DAVID STEIN, 70, MUSIC EXEC

Full text: Malverne record executive David Stein was instrumental in bringing the Scottish pop band Bay City Rollers to the United States.
He brought the teenage pop group, which had been gaining notoriety in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, to the attention of famed music promoter and producer Sid Bernstein, family said.
Bernstein helped to usher in the British Invasion to America by introducing such rock bands as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. And Bernstein was on the lookout for similar acts.
Stein, Bernstein's longtime associate, suggested the Bay City Rollers, boarding a flight to Edinburgh, Scotland, and eventually premiering the band stateside in 1975 on sports broadcaster's Howard Cosell's short-lived "Saturday Night Live" television show.
The group eventually topped the Billboard Hot 100 charts with their single "Saturday Night."
"Bernstein once said that David had the best ear in the music industry," said Barbara Pastore of Malverne, Stein's partner for the past 15 years.
Stein died at Long Island Jewish Hospital on July 23 from spinal surgery complications. He was 70.
Stein was born in the East New York section of Brooklyn on March 11, 1948, family said.
Those who knew him best said his love for music came naturally.
"It was something about music," Pastore said. "He loved the lyrics more than music."
Throughout his career, Stein hung around and worked with some of the brightest in the music industry.
He even brokered a deal in the 1970s for Cousin Brucie, then a popular New York City disc jockey known as DJ Bruce, to move from WABC to WNBC, according to family and reports.
Later in his career, he opened record stores in Cedarhurst and Oceanside and managed The Dynomiters, another teen pop group, family said.
He had amassed nearly 50,000 records in his basement at the time of his death, family said.
Stein also had been a friend of comedian Jerry Lewis, family said.
"I'm going to miss everything about him. He was my better half. He was everything," Pastore said.
Friends said Stein made an impact as a record executive.
"He was very instrumental in music," said Vito Turso of Queens, a friend of Stein. "He had a long career with people in music."
"He was a caring, smart man. And he was very, very good at trivia," Turso said.
Away from music, Stein had a strong religious background. His father was a founder of The Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach.
His funeral was held July 25 at the Boulevard-Riverside Chapels in Hewlett. Stein was buried at Beth David Cemetery in Elmont. He is survived by Past

Hempstead billed about $4,800 by law firm in Gunther case: The town hired a special prosecutor in the action filed against an employee who was accused of allowing construction debris to collect outside his home

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Town of Hempstead spent nearly $4,800 to hire a special prosecutor in a case filed against one of its own employees where the charges were ultimately dismissed.
The town filed a violation in May against Roy Gunther Jr., a town municipal code officer who allegedly allowed construction debris and garbage from superstorm Sandy repairs to accumulate outside his Oceanside home. Other summonses against him were dropped because the inspector wrote an incorrect date on the ticket for failing to have a permit to disconnect a gas meter.
The town had hired a special prosecutor, Jeffrey Schwartz of the Garden City firm Jaspan Schlesinger, to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest.
Jaspan Schlesinger billed the town for a total of $4,792.50, according to town records. The bills were submitted to the town in October and December 2017 and Jan. 10.
The case was dismissed on Dec. 5 with the condition that Gunther not commit any other crimes or offenses through Dec. 31. Dismissals usually occur after a six-month time frame, but attorneys on both sides agreed to shorten it after the disposition took longer to take to court than anticipated.
Gunther had been suspended without pay by the town for five days over the summer. A town official said the suspension was related to the court case.
Jaspan Schlesinger's bills were signed by Lisa Cairo, a partner in the firm and daughter of Nassau Republican Committee vice chairman Joseph Cairo.

Code officer who faces court case suspended by town

Author: Dazio, Stefanie

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]29 Aug 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Hempstead Town code enforcement officer accused of letting debris pile up outside his Oceanside home has been suspended from his job for five days, the town's spokesman said.
Roy Gunther Jr. was charged by the town in May with a violation after he allegedly let garbage and construction debris accumulate outside his home during renovations to repair damage from superstorm Sandy, which hit in 2012.
Town spokesman Mike Deery said Gunther has been suspended without pay from Aug. 28 to Friday.
A town official said the suspension was related to Gunther's court case.
Gunther's attorney, Michael Elbaz of Manhattan, could not be reached for comment on Monday.
Gunther appeared in court on Aug. 17 and the case has been adjourned until Sept. 19 as the town appoints a special prosecutor to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Gunther is listed as a "code enforcement officer III" in the town building department at an annual salary of $125,333, according to 2016 town payroll records. He has worked for the town since 1999.
An "on-site field inspection" found "brick piles, milk crates, a sink, a toilet bowl, and varying garbage and construction debris stored on the property at the exterior of the dwelling," at Gunther's Riverside Drive home, court documents state.
Fines for the violation are set at the court's discretion but could reach $500.
Gunther received two other summonses because he did not have a permit to disconnect a gas meter, but the building inspector wrote the wrong date on the ticket and the charges were dropped.

Full text: A Hempstead Town municipal code enforcement officer is to return to court Nov. 8 on charges that he let debris pile up outside his Oceanside home.
Roy Gunther Jr. appeared in court Tuesday with his lawyer, Michael Elbaz, and special prosecutor Jeffrey Schwartz of the Garden City law firm Jaspan Schlesinger. Schwartz is acting as a special prosecutor in the case so the town avoids an appearance of a conflict of interest in a case against one of its own employees.
In a brief appearance before Judge William Hohauser in District Court in Hempstead Tuesday, the attorneys agreed to file motions before Nov. 8. The defense's motions are due by Oct. 10 and Schwartz must respond by Oct. 24. Then Elbaz gets until Oct. 31 to reply to Schwartz.
The town charged Gunther in May with a violation, accusing him of allowing construction debris and garbage to accumulate outside his home while it underwent repairs for damage from superstorm Sandy. Gunther was suspended without pay from his job as a town "code enforcement officer III" for five days in late August.
Gunther's other summonses for failing to have a permit to disconnect a gas meter were dropped because the inspector wrote the wrong date on the ticket.
Schwartz, Elbaz and Gunther declined to comment after court.

Cops: Driver evacuates passengers before bus gutted by fire

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Six people with developmental disabilities escaped from harm Monday morning when their bus driver pulled them off the smoking vehicle before it burst into flames in Roosevelt, police said.
"We saw the pictures, it was a very scary situation," said Anita Dowd-Neufeld, chief administrative officer of Family Residences and Essential Enterprises in Old Bethpage, where the bus, operated by Guardian Bus Company, was headed.
The driver of the bus noticed smoke and evacuated the six occupants on board at Bennett Avenue and St. Francis Street about 7:51 a.m., Nassau County police said.
"He got all the kids off, and while waiting for a pickup bus, his bus went on fire," a police spokeswoman said.
There were no reported injuries, the spokeswoman said.
The second bus took the passengers, all of whom are over 18 years old with developmental disabilities and live in western Nassau County, to their program in Old Bethpage. FREE, a nonprofit, helps individuals with disabilities, and its work includes day programs, recovery services, education and after-school support.
Dowd-Neufeld said the six were checked out by a nurse and had the opportunity to meet with a psychologist if they wished. They resumed their normal routines when they arrived at the program.
"When they came in, they were just like, 'Yeah, this happened, you're not going to believe what happened on the bus,'" Dowd-Neufeld said. "It was more the staff that was really shaken up by it."
Guardian, of Oceanside, did not respond to several messages requesting comment on the incident. On Monday afternoon, a man who answered a phone number listed for Guardian said in a brief conversation that the driver had gone home for lunch and was not immediately available. An employee who was locking up the premises of the company Monday afternoon declined to comment.
Dowd-Neufeld, who said the agency has only had a contract with Guardian since August, said she did not know the identity of the driver, but wished to thank him.
"Thank you for getting them out in time, saving their lives," she said. "It's really heroic."
A similar incident occurred in April 2016, when a Guardian Bus Company bus caught fire en route to Merrick Avenue Middle School. About a dozen students and the bus driver escaped injury in that incident.

Kombucha: Brewed, sweetened, fermented tea getting popular

Author: Hirsch, Corin

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]30 Mar 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1882063481?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first time I tasted kombucha, about 10 years ago, my nose crinkled. Daryn Stoger is less generous with his description: "It tasted like vinegar."
Those first impressions were common in the early days of kombucha's current revival. Now, with a new generation of kombucha brewers such as Stoger - who, with his partner, Rachel Rappa, bottles 100 gallons of the stuff each week at Coastal Craft Kombucha in Oceanside - it's on many supermarket shelves.
I reach for it reflexively when spring arrives; with its wisp of alcohol (usually less than 0.5 percent) and distinctive tang, kombucha can be a solid substitute for beer at the time of year when our bodies might crave a break from the indulgences of winter.
Kombucha is essentially brewed, sweetened tea fermented with a slippery disc-like starter called a scoby (an acronym for "symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast"). The origins of that starter supposedly stretch back to third-century China; more certain is that the funky, fizzy product of that fermentation is full of antioxidants, B vitamins and probiotics. Kombucha devotees swear the drink aids digestion and natural detoxification; others just find it energizing.
Rappa, a Long Beach native, began home-brewing kombucha four years ago after taking a kombucha-making workshop in Brooklyn. She began to distribute her efforts among family and friends, and as she refined her culture and process, finessing kombucha's rougher edges, the kombucha "began to grow in personality," Stoger said.
The couple began producing the drink commercially in 2015, fermenting a base of brewed black and green teas - as well as cold-brewed coffee and even yerba mate - before adding fresh fruit juices, herb extracts and spices. One of their seven flavors, Hawaiian Fire, pairs pineapple juice with a spicy hit of cayenne. Another, Berry Hibiscus, is bright-pink, floral, subtly tangy and totally delicious, a kombucha for people who swear they don't like kombucha.
Rappa and Stoger sell their kombucha across Long Island at specialty markets and a handful of farmers markets for about $5 for 16 ounces. If you want the full experience of kicking back with a pint of kombucha, though, it's on tap at The Purple Elephant in Northport.

Full text: Two officers were injured and two suspects were arrested after police interrupted a fraudulent check-passing scam Wednesday at a bank in Lynbrook, officials said.
The arrests came after a pursuit that ended with the getaway car crashing into a nearby gas station that was under construction, knocking down a pump, officials said Thursday.
Arrested were Jazzmene Turner, 22, of the Bronx, and getaway driver Mikheal Grandison, 21, of Springfield Gardens, Queens, officials said. A third suspect, a male, is still being sought.
"I'm very proud of my police," Lynbrook Mayor William Hendrick said. "I'd guess these gentlemen and woman are now sorry they came to Lynbrook to start trouble."
Turner was charged with two counts of second-degree possession of a forged instrument and resisting arrest, Lynbrook Police Chief Joseph Neve said.
He said Grandison was taken to a hospital to be treated for a head laceration suffered when he crashed the getaway car into the pump. Grandison then was charged with unlawful fleeing of a police officer, as well as reckless driving, second-degree and fourth-degree criminal mischief, first-degree reckless endangerment and two counts of assault, Neve said.
Turner was being held Thursday after arraignment in First District Court in Hempstead on $25,000 cash bail or $25,000 bond, while Grandison was being held on $100,000 cash bail or $200,000 bond.
Neither of them had an attorney listed in court records. They are both due back in court on Monday.
The identity of the third suspect has not been released. Officials said he was able to flee the scene on foot.
Police said the trio attempted to cash forged checks at a Citibank branch on West Merrick Road and said officers were dispatched to the scene after bank officials reported the crime in progress. After seeing the officers, the trio attempted to flee, Neve said.
One of the suspects fled on foot, running through the parking lot of a nearby White Castle before he disappeared, Hendrick said.
Meanwhile, Officer Salvatore Sedita, a 10-year veteran, attempted to stop Grandison and Turner from fleeing in the car, but was struck by the car door, injuring his hand, Neve said. Grandison managed to drive the 2004 Honda away from the scene, but hit an unmarked police car, and later crashed into the Ultra gas station at Broadway and Scranton Avenue, officials said.
In a news release about the case, Nassau County police said Turner flailed her arms and kicked at officers as she was apprehended.
Because the station is under construction, officials said, there was no gas in the pump that was demolished in the crash.
Sedita was taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside to be treated for a bruised hand and fingers, Neve said. He said that Det. Sgt. William Straub, the driver of the unmarked police car, was taken to Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, where he remained under observation on Thursday for unspecified medical issues.

'Never be silent,' twins who survived Holocaust implore others: Irene Hizme, brother Rene Slotkin sent to Auschwitz at age 6 Siblings say everyone has an obligation to fight hate

Full text: Fraternal twins who survived Dr. Josef Mengele's Holocaust experiments called on people to "never be silent in the face of prejudice and human suffering" at a Holocaust commemoration event Sunday.
Irene Hizme and Rene Slotkin, 79, said that while discussing their time at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp is painful, they have to remind the world of the "evil unleashed there," especially as hate crimes rise across the country.
"Every human being has a personal responsibility to fight hate," Hizme told about 150 people at the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County in Glen Cove. "The truth is on our side, and the road to Auschwitz is paved with silence."
Hizme and Slotkin, who were born in Czechoslovakia, were 6 years old when they were taken to Auschwitz-Birkenau and separated from each other and their mother, Ita Guttmann - who was killed at the camp - in 1943. Hizme said she was regularly injected with unknown substances in experiments supervised by Mengele, the so-called "Angel of Death." Slotkin was a "control subject," used as a comparison to his sister.
"It was much worse than you think or saw or heard," Slotkin said Sunday before the start of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which ends Monday at sundown.
Hizme, who has multiple sclerosis, said she was often sick at the camp's hospital and avoided one of the "periodic purges of patients" by hiding under a nurse's skirt.
"I cannot tell you what a day in Auschwitz was like or what I did on any given day, but the unimaginable things I saw and experienced are etched in my psyche for all time," Hizme said.
Hizme and Slotkin are believed to be one of the last sets of twins to survive Nazi experiments. Of the 7,000 prisoners who were experimented on, 3,000 were twins, said Beth Lilach, the memorial's senior director of education and community affairs. Only 160 twins survived the camp.
Hizme and Slotkin, who were at Auschwitz until it was liberated in 1945, said they saw each other only once - from afar.
The twins were reunited in 1950 with help from some unlikely people, including the notorious gangster Al Capone, who reportedly put a word in to the White House about the pair's troubles.
Hizme and Slotkin were adopted by the same family, the Slotkins, who lived in Lawrence. Hizme became a chemist and lives in Oceanside. Slotkin worked for 30 years for a paper-folding company in Valley Stream and now lives in Manhattan.
"There's a great world out there," Slotkin said, touching his chest. "But don't ever forget what happened because I feel, I feel, I feel, it could happen again."

Too few LIRR trains on Long Beach branch

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]18 Mar 2017.

Full text: Too few LIRR trains on Long Beach branch
The train service for the Long Beach branch of the Long Island Rail Road is deplorable, especially the stops east of Lynbrook. The schedule discourages us from enjoying the theater and the many other forms of entertainment in New York City, because the wait between trains sometimes exceeds an hour.
I believe the LIRR caters exclusively to the elite areas of Long Island, with service at some times of day approximately every half hour. I have been reviewing the time schedules during my hour-long waits.
I pay high fares, the same as everyone else on Long Island, and I demand equal service.
Joann Pellino, Oceanside
Asset forfeiture system is unjust
Civil asset forfeiture, I believe, is an unconstitutional and unethical tool that law enforcement uses to seize property it believes to be involved in criminal activity. The person whose property is taken doesn't even need to be charged with a crime.
This tool has been abused and used as a revenue source. In 1997, New York seized $8 million in assets, while in 2013, it seized $46.8 million. As reported by Newsday, in 2013, Suffolk police ended up with $3.2 million through asset forfeiture.
The system gives police incentive to police for profit. The people who are supposed to be public servants end up being revenue generators for the state at the expense of others' liberty and property.
New York needs to learn from states like California, where Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill last year that requires police to obtain a criminal conviction before they can seize assets with a value of up to $40,000. It's time to end this legalized form of robbery.

Judge postpones ruling in Marine Jason Brezler's expulsion case

Author: Kessler, Robert E

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 Oct 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1828995775?accountid=37869

Abstract: [...]on Friday, Wasserstrom noted that an investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service found that Brezler's personal computer contained not only the confidential document that Brezler sent on the unsecured line, but also another 100 additional confidential documents and 750 confidential PowerPoint presentations, as well as a manuscript he was writing about his experiences.

Full text:   A federal judge in Central Islip on Friday postponed ruling on whether the Marine Corps should be blocked from kicking out a major who sent a confidential document over an unsecured line in what the officer said was an attempt to save the lives of fellow Marines.
U.S. District Judge Joseph Bianco instead gave the government 10 days to produce evidence that the Marine board of inquiry that recommended that Major Jason Brezler be expelled was properly instituted and followed Marine Corps regulations.
Brezler, a graduate of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, serves in the Marine Corps Reserve and also is a New York City firefighter with an elite unit, Rescue 2 in Brooklyn.
On Friday, the courtroom was packed with 150 city firefighters in dress uniforms in support of Brezler - many from the city's elite rescue units or former Marines themselves.
Attorneys for Brezler - Michael Bowe and Kevin Carroll - have argued that an investigation into the officer's actions had not recommended dismissal, but included various lesser punishments.
But the attorneys said that the Marines hastily and improperly convened the inquiry board in 2013 in retaliation against Brezler after Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) began inquiries into the treatment of the officer.
Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Leigh Wasserstrom, representing the Marine Corps and the Navy, argued that the Marines had followed the required procedures.
The case had gone through four levels of review by higher authorities, Wasserstrom said, in addition to an investigation by the independent inspector general of the U.S. Department of Defense.
It is highly unusual, as Bianco noted, for a civilian judge to overrule the decisions by the military.
But at Friday's court appearance, the judge questioned whether it was proper for the inquiry board to be set up as Wasserstrom had described - with only an oral recommendation by an officer, and not a written recommendation.
Also on Friday, Wasserstrom noted that an investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service found that Brezler's personal computer contained not only the confidential document that Brezler sent on the unsecured line, but also another 100 additional confidential documents and 750 confidential PowerPoint presentations, as well as a manuscript he was writing about his experiences.
Bowe said after court that the other documents were really in a single file containing his service records and other related materials.
The classified email Brezler sent from a graduate course in Oklahoma back to Afghanistan involved an Afghan police official's return to a Marine base. Brezler had been key in the removal of the local official from the base in 2010 because of corruption and the official's practice of keeping teenage boys as sex slaves, according to court papers.
Brezler's attorneys have maintained that if the Marines had acted on the background information in the email, it might have prevented the 2012 murder of three Marines, including Lance Cpl. Gregory Buckley Jr. of Oceanside, by one of the teens the police official brought with him to the base.
After Friday's hearing, Rep. King said by telephone: "Jason Brezler's quest to attain justice is closer to being realized."

Charles Burke, ex-treasurer, stole from union, DA says

Abstract: An investigation allegedly showed Burke had stolen more than $111,000 by failing to pay dues to the national organization, writing checks to himself and taking money out of Local 365's bank accounts without the union knowing or giving permission, prosecutors said.

Full text:   An Oceanside man surrendered to prosecutors Tuesday to face felony charges for allegedly stealing more than $100,000 from the union where he had been treasurer.
The Nassau district attorney's office charged Charles Burke, 47, with grand larceny and scheme to defraud.
Prosecutors claimed Burke "allegedly enriched himself with union funds" for more than five years while treasurer of Utility Workers Union of America Local 365.
They said he was facing a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years in prison if found guilty of the top count.
But Burke's attorney, Ronald Bekoff, said Tuesday that the defendant denies the allegations and is a hard-working husband and father of three children.
The Garden City lawyer said Burke is currently working three jobs to support his family and has no criminal record.
Hempstead District Court Judge Joseph Girardi conditionally released Burke to probation at his arraignment, according to authorities.
Prosecutors said the crimes came to light after the international treasurer for the union notified Local 365 in October 2014 that more than two years of payments hadn't been received.
An investigation allegedly showed Burke had stolen more than $111,000 by failing to pay dues to the national organization, writing checks to himself and taking money out of Local 365's bank accounts without the union knowing or giving permission, prosecutors said.
The Nassau district attorney's office said it jointly investigated the case with the U.S. Department of Labor.
A man who answered the phone at a listing for the local union office hung up when asked for comment Tuesday.

Kaminsky, McGrath trade jabs on corruption as TV debate nears: Lawmaker, attorney set to square off Thursday April 19 special vote spurred by Skelos' conviction

Abstract: Todd Kaminsky and Christopher McGrath traded barbs Sunday over debates and responses to corruption as the race for former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos' seat enters its final phase.

Full text:   The campaigns of Assemb. Todd Kaminsky and Christopher McGrath traded barbs Sunday over debates and responses to corruption as the race for former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos' seat enters its final phase.
Although the two candidates are scheduled to face off in a televised debate Thursday, Kaminsky attacked McGrath for not debating him at candidate events.
"He's refused to stand up in front of voters and answer basic questions about key issues in an important election," Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) said at a news conference in Oceanside. Kaminsky challenged McGrath to debate him in a setting where voters could ask questions before the April 19 special election.
"Hiding from voters in a democracy is not acceptable," Kaminsky said.
The McGrath campaign shot back that Kaminsky was a "hypocrite."
"Chris McGrath is speaking to voters every day at the same time that Todd Kaminsky isn't showing up for work in Albany," campaign spokesman E. O'Brien Murray said.
A spokesman for Kaminsky said his attendance record was "outstanding."
The election is being forced by Skelos' December conviction on eight counts of bribery, extortion and conspiracy. The high-stakes fight over his seat could affect control over the Senate, where Republicans hold on to power with a coalition of Independent Democrats.
Kaminsky, a former federal prosecutor, framed the election as a referendum on corruption, and alleged Sunday that voters "don't know whether Chris McGrath even thinks corruption is a problem."
Murray said that's not true.
"From day one in his campaign he has addressed this issue," Murray said. "Chris McGrath has been in favor of term limits ... and he is for taking pensions away from convicted politicians," Murray said.
McGrath's statements in Newsday last week about Skelos having done "good things" in the community while having made "mistakes" also drew fire.
"What Dean Skelos did was violate the trust that voters placed in him," Kaminsky said. He said the crimes Skelos was found guilty of were not mistakes.
"A mistake is when you accidentally put on socks that don't match," Kaminsky said.
Kaminsky said Sunday that he also favors term limits but that his main solution to corruption would be a prohibition against legislators collecting outside income, to root out potential conflicts of interest.
Murray said McGrath, a personal-injury attorney and partner with the Garden City law firm of Sullivan, Papain, Block, McGrath & Cannavo P.C., is against having a professional legislature with career politicians.

Hempstead Lake State Park to get $750G of teacher's estate

Author: Gralla, Joan

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 May 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1787307259?accountid=37869

Abstract: Hempstead Lake State Park will receive about $750,000 from the estate - one of the largest gifts ever made to a Long Island state park.

Full text:   A retired teacher donated almost his entire estate, including his art - Chinese porcelain, Japanese prints, photographs and paintings by American, French and German artists - to the park he loved best.
Hempstead Lake State Park will receive about $750,000 from the estate - one of the largest gifts ever made to a Long Island state park.
"It's so unusual for us," said George Gorman, Long Island deputy regional director of the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
The bequest from Philip Scott of Rockville Centre will become an endowment for Hempstead Lake.
Scott, a World War II veteran who taught in the Oceanside school district, began visiting the nearby park after moving to Rockville Centre in the 1960s, Gorman said.
"In the later years of his life, he walked around the lake almost every day enjoying the peacefulness of the park," Gorman said.
His collection was notable, not just for its value, but also for its range. In addition to African artworks, there were lithographs and even a Renaissance woodcut by noted German artist Lucas Cranach the Elder, according to auction records.
Scott was quite expert in all of the different art mediums and periods, said Gorman, who was given a detailed tour when he met with him several weeks before his death at age 82 on April 19, 2013.
The collector, consulting his extensive files, predicted how much each item might fetch at auction, Gorman said.
Scott was not only meticulously organized, he was also exceptionally modest.
"Mr. Scott did not request any recognition for this donation," Gorman said.
That did not seem fitting to park officials.
"To honor his memory and permanently acknowledge his devotion to Hempstead Lake State Park, we named the pavilion at Hempstead Lake the Philip Scott Memorial Pavilion," Gorman said. Last month, a plaque bearing Scott's name was placed on the pavilion, the site of many a picnic.
The artwork raised a total of $295,000, Gorman said.
The most valuable item was a 7-inch-tall Tibetan gilt-bronze figure of Manjusrivajra, a sword-wielding Buddhist deity, which fetched $81,250, auction records showed.
Other standouts included a 1916 oil painting, "Weehawken Grain Elevators," by American modernist John Marin, which went for $46,875, and a 1960 oil painting on a panel of a colorful coastal village by Indian artist Sayed Haider Raza that went for $43,750.
Scott's bequest also included his home and car.

Hempstead to vote on zombie home law covering commercial sites

Author: Asbury, John

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]17 June 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1797472121?accountid=37869

Abstract: The town board voted last month to require banks to put down a $25,000 deposit for zombie home upkeep, encouraging banks to maintain homes and sell them quicker in order to deter lower property values and homes falling into disrepair.

Full text:   Hempstead Town officials are looking to double down on their recently passed zombie home law by requiring banks to place a deposit on vacant, dilapidated zombie businesses.
The town is expected to vote Tuesday to pass a bill requiring bank-owned commercial properties to put down a $35,000 payment whenever a business goes into foreclosure.
Zombie homes are those in the foreclosure process.
Town workers would use the funds to maintain vacant businesses, including cutting grass, removing graffiti and maintaining property appearances, such as doors and windows.
Any bank-owned property that does not comply would be fined between $500 to $1,500 per day until they make the deposit.
Hempstead Supervisor Anthony Santino announced the measure after the town passed a similar penalty last month on zombie homes.
"A blighted business can drive customers away from a local downtown, encourage vandalism and adversely impact local home values," Santino said. "We're taking steps to hold lenders accountable. I won't stand for banks that reap profits on business loans and then walk away from their responsibility to maintain commercial properties once they start a foreclosure proceeding. It's time to make banks pay, and it's time to make sure they are better neighbors."
The town board voted last month to require banks to put down a $25,000 deposit for zombie home upkeep, encouraging banks to maintain homes and sell them quicker in order to deter lower property values and homes falling into disrepair.
Santino said the penalty process would be the same for businesses, which can drive down the values of downtowns and drive away visitors from communities.
If the town spends the entire deposit, banks would be required to replenish the account until the businesses are fixed or sold.
Town board members pointed to several businesses in Elmont, West Hempstead, Seaford and Oceanside that have been shuttered and abandoned by bank lenders.
The legislation is not targeting specific business owners, but properties that have already been turned over to lenders looking to leave properties vacant while waiting for the real estate market to improve, Santino said.
Santino said a Ruby Tuesday restaurant has remained untouched since superstorm Sandy with the final meals on the tables.
"Sandy took a problem and exacerbated it significantly," Santino said.

Abstract: A Los Angeles man charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of his estranged wife's boyfriend in Valley Stream pleaded not guilty yesterday morning and was ordered held without bail.

Full text:   A Los Angeles man charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of his estranged wife's boyfriend in Valley Stream pleaded not guilty yesterday morning and was ordered held without bail.
At the arraignment for murder suspect Deon Ewers, 50, in First District Court in Hempstead, prosecutors called him a "flight risk."
Nassau homicide detectives had arrested Ewers in Oceanside on Saturday. That was a day after police said he forced his way into the house of his estranged wife about 7 a.m. and shot and killed a man identified yesterday in court papers and by relatives as Majid Morris, 34.
The woman and the 14-year-old son she had with Ewers were inside the home at 26 E. Hawthorne Ave. at the time of the shooting but were not injured, police said.
Police said the couple separated last year after about 13 years of marriage. Ewers flew to New York on Thursday night, and within an hour of landing had forced himself upstairs in the Valley Stream home, authorities said. Nassau police and prosecutors said Ewers shot the man five times in a bedroom with a semiautomatic handgun.
Authorities said Ewers had no prior criminal record, but prosecutors said yesterday that he had an active felony warrant in Miami-Dade County in Florida. The nature of the warrant could not be determined last night.
Jordana Snape, 24, of Springfield, Massachusetts, a sister of Morris, said her brother was originally from the country of Jamaica. She described Morris as a "sweetheart" and said he had an 8-year-old daughter.
Morris had worked in construction, driving materials to and from local building sites, and was weighing his next career move, Snape said.
"He just wanted to be a millionaire," Snape said. "He had plans."
His friends called him "Maj" for short, or "Stylo," because he was a "shopaholic" praised for his wardrobe of Versace jeans, Gucci sneakers and Ralph Lauren polo shirts.
More than a dozen of Morris' relatives attended the hearing as Ewers, who is expected back in court Thursday, stood in a white jumpsuit, his hands cuffed behind his back.
"Everybody is crying," Snape said as she headed to the exit.

2 RESCUED, 1 MAN CRITICAL

Abstract: A young couple from Elmont said they saw rescue workers trying to revive a young adult male.

Full text:   Long Beach police rescued two men from the water who had been trapped in a rip current last night, with one in critical condition, authorities said.
Long Beach lifeguards spotted a Brooklyn man in distress in the water about 6:30 p.m. in front of the Allegria Hotel and boardwalk near National Boulevard, Long Beach Police Commissioner Michael Tangney said.
Lifeguards and police pulled the man from the water and he was treated with a breathing apparatus while conscious, police said. The man said he was swimming with his friend, a 23-year-old man from Brooklyn, who went missing when waves pulled him underwater, police said.
Long Beach police, lifeguards and Nassau County aviation and Nassau County marine officers launched an extensive search for the other man. Officers on boats and watercrafts patrolled the water for about an hour until the man was found submerged, Tangney said.
Coast Guard officials said resources from the Jones Beach Station were dispatched and aircraft from Cape Cod also was sent to assist with the search.
Rescuers pulled the man - who was still alive - to shore and gave him CPR, police said. He was taken by ambulance to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside. Family members were notified of his critical condition, Tangney said.
The first man rescued, who was not hurt, was being questioned by police.
Police said both men had been warned of the bad rip currents and were told to leave the water earlier in the day. But they went back into the ocean after lifeguards had left for the day, police said.
Long Beach lifeguards made several rescues because of riptides throughout the day, including minutes earlier near Edwards Boulevard, Tangney said.
"That's why it's so important to swim with lifeguards on duty," Tangney said.
A young couple from Elmont said they saw rescue workers trying to revive a young adult male.
Kaydina Dodd said, "They were still working on him right up until they loaded him in the ambulance but I'm praying that he will be fine."
Police, firefighters and off-duty lifeguards all responded, according to Dodd and Karl Louis. The rescue involved about two helicopters and three or four boats, they said.

STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED AS CASES RISE: CUOMO: EXPEDITED PURCHASING, HIRING AS NY CASES HIT 89

Author: Olson, David

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 Mar 2020: 4.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Saturday declared a state of emergency as the number of coronavirus cases statewide rose to 89, with most of the positive test results linked to a single Westchester County resident.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Saturday that one of the seven new New York City cases is a man in his 30s who is an Uber driver on Long Island. He was hospitalized at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens, a source said. 
Uber declined to answer questions on where the man drove for the ride-hailing service on Long Island, how long he has been driving, how many passengers he has carried in the past two weeks and whether the company is contacting passengers who rode with him.
Uber said in a statement that "we have a dedicated team working closely with public health authorities and stand ready to help in any way." The company said it has sent messages to drivers on precautions to take to prevent the spread of the virus.
No new cases were reported on Long Island on Saturday. Four Nassau County residents tested positive Thursday and Friday.
The state of emergency allows for expedited purchasing of items such as swabs for testing, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and protective equipment, along with additional hiring, Cuomo said in an afternoon news conference from Albany.
Those items will be sent to local health departments, he said.
Nassau County Executive Laura Curran praised the move, saying that "by declaring a disaster emergency, the state is assisting our efforts to effectively contain the virus."
Seventy of the state's cases are in Westchester, all part of a "contagion cluster" traced back to a New Rochelle man who works at a Manhattan law firm, the governor's office said.
"Westchester is an obvious problem for us," Cuomo said.
In addition to the new Westchester and New York City cases, there are two new cases in upstate Saratoga County, the first there, Cuomo said. There are also two cases in Rockland County, he said.
No information was available on how the patient hospitalized in Far Rockaway contracted the virus, but hospital officials were monitoring team members who came in contact with the patient, hospital spokesman Tom Melillo said. 
The hospital staff was working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health officials and notifying staff members Saturday morning, he said. No staff members were quarantined.
Cuomo said the rising number of cases are to be expected with testing of people who may have come in contact with those who have the virus.
"The more tests the better, the more positives you find the better, because then you can isolate them and you slow the spread," he said.
Curran said Northwell Health may begin testing as early as Sunday, which will help expedite test results, because respiratory samples could be analyzed at Northwell's Lake Success labs, rather than being sent to Albany, as they are now.
In Nassau, there are 16 tests with results pending, Curran said late Saturday afternoon. There are nine pending results in Suffolk County, the Suffolk health department said Saturday afternoon.
In Nassau, tests came back positive Thursday for a 42-year-old man now at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, and on Friday for three women who Curran said "are close contacts with the man who tested positive."
The women, ages 36, 41 and 63, all live in the Town of Hempstead, Curran said.
Two of the women are hospitalized, one at NYU Winthrop and one at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, Curran said. The other woman is in quarantine in her home and does not require hospitalization, Nassau County Health Department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain said.
A source said the man lives in Uniondale. He is a part-time employee at Mercy, said officials at Catholic Health Services, which operates the hospital. They have declined to say whether he has a job that involves contact with patients, citing privacy laws.
The man has no history of travel to countries with especially large numbers of COVID-19 cases and no known contact with another individual with the virus, state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker has said.
Laurain said Saturday that Nassau health officials are now engaged in the "intense work" of interviewing those who tested positive to find out where they have been and who they were in contact with. Then investigators will locate those people and will institute mandatory quarantines for those who were in direct contact with people that have the virus, she said.
Twenty-one people are in mandatory quarantine in Nassau, Curran said. That is allowed under a state directive for several groups of people, including those who test positive and those who have been in close contact with people who have tested positive.
Sixty-seven people are in voluntary home isolation because of travel to countries with high numbers of coronavirus cases, she said.
In Suffolk, there are 24 people in self-isolation because of their travel history, the health department said.
NASSAU CENTER TO OPEN
Nassau County on Sunday will open a seven-day-a-week emergency operations center for coronavirus efforts, similar to centers opened during snowstorms and other weather emergencies, said Steven Morelli, commissioner of the county's Office of Emergency Management.
The center will assist health care providers and hospitals that are running low on critical equipment or overwhelmed by patients, and would respond to emergency situations, such as if there are reports of a person exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 on a Long Island Rail Road train, he said.
Cuomo said in a statement that the expedited purchasing outlined in the state of emergency, as well as allowing qualified professionals other than doctors and nurses to do testing for the virus, and expedited leasing of lab space, "gives us certain powers to help local health departments that are very stressed." 
The declaration also will help the state in investigating reports of price-gouging by stores for hand sanitizer and other items being bought to help prevent transmission of the virus, he said.
Funding will come from the $40 million emergency coronavirus spending measure Cuomo signed Tuesday, according to the governor's office. That's in addition to about $30 million in weekly coronavirus-related spending from the current state budget, Cuomo's office said.
Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) said in a statement that "the state of emergency is a necessary step to allow local entities to take critical measures to protect New Yorkers."
Rice will hold a town hall on COVID-19 at 1 p.m. Sunday at Oceanside Middle School, 186 Alice Ave., in Oceanside. Curran, a Nassau health department official and a Northwell infectious diseases specialist will be among those who will answer residents' questions, Rice's office said.
Cuomo announced Saturday that outside visitors will be barred from nursing homes and senior-living centers in New Rochelle. Those facilities are being given guidance and protocols on preventing the spread of the virus, he said.
Older adults, as well as people who are immunocompromised or have other underlying health conditions, such as respiratory diseases, are at higher risk for serious COVID-19 illnesses, according to the CDC.
Nursing homes, Cuomo said, are "what I worry about. That's what keeps me up at night."
At least 10 of the 19 deaths nationally have been linked to a Seattle-area nursing home, along with dozens of other infections among residents, staff and family members.
Cuomo said he doesn't believe it is necessary at this point for most New Yorkers to avoid sporting events, concerts and other crowded venues. But, he said, "my message would be if you are a senior citizen or immunocompromised I would think seriously about attending a large gathering now. I said that to my mother."
Cuomo administration officials said Saturday that a plane carrying 73 SUNY students who were in an area with a high number of COVID-19 cases was expected to arrive Saturday at Kennedy Airport. 
The governor said he is concerned about reports that some people who are supposed to be in voluntary home self-isolation are not staying isolated and told them "you could be putting people in danger." He said if they don't comply voluntarily, "there are other measures we could take." The governor's office later said that could include mandatory quarantine or isolation. 
In other developments Saturday:
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions such as heart, lung or kidney disease to "stay home as much as possible" and avoid crowds to avoid contracting the coronavirus. The CDC updated the guidance on its COVID-19 website on Friday. The agency said older people are more likely to have serious illness and that underlying health conditions make it harder for people to fight off the illness.
Of the 19 deaths in the United States, 16 were in Washington state. Two people have died in Florida and one has died in California. While the global death toll has risen past 3,500, more people have now recovered from the virus than are sickened by it, The Associated Press reported. As of Saturday, nearly 90,000 cases had been reported in Asia; more than 8,000 in Europe; some 6,000 in the Middle East; about 400 in North America; about 50 in Latin America and the Caribbean, and fewer than 50 cases reported so far in Africa.
A hotel in China holding people who had contact with coronavirus patients collapsed, trapping 70 people inside, according to local news reports. At least 48 people were rescued from the wreckage, of the Xinjia Express Hotel in Quanzhou, a city in Fujian province, the Ministry of Emergency Management said. The 80-room hotel had been converted by the city government for observation of people who had contact with virus patients, according to the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily.

Dozens of teens witnessed boy's fatal stabbing. Some took video; none helped, police say

Abstract: Khaseen Morris, 16, died after he was stabbed during a brawl Monday. Police say a group of teens gathered to watch and record the fight.

Full text: Police are searching for multiple people after a 16-year-old Long Island boy was stabbed to death during a brutal beating that was captured on video by a group of his peers.
Khaseen Morris died just before midnight Monday of a stab wound after a brawl outside a strip mall in Oceanside, New York, Nassau County Police Det. Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick said at a news conference Tuesday.
Fitzpatrick said six or seven people attacked Morris and his friends while between 50 and 70 onlookers watched and some recorded the melee on their phones. Footage of the incident circulated on Snapchat and other social media platforms.
"Kids stood here and didn't help Khaseen," Fitzpatrick said. "They videoed his death instead of helping him. "
'Beyond disturbing': A teen girl was beaten as onlookers laughed, viral video shows
Morris was a senior at at Oceanside High School, school district spokesperson Donna M. Kraus confirmed.
"The community is shocked and saddened by this tragedy," Kraus said. "We have counselors supporting our students and we’ve reached out to Khaseen’s family. "
Fitzpatrick said the fight was sparked by "a dispute over a young lady" that Morris was seen with. Keyanna Morris, 30, told Newsday that her brother had walked a girl home and had been threatened by the girl's ex-boyfriend. Keyanna Morris said Khaseen wasn't worried.
"Khaseen is like, ‘OK, if you beat me up, fine. ’” she told the outlet. "No one knew he was going to bring a million people out there — and a knife. "
Fitzpatrick confirmed that Morris had been threatened through social media, and that he was unarmed even though he knew that someone might show up to assault him after school.
One of Morris' friends was left with a broken arm; others suffered minor injuries, Fitzpatrick said. He said that some witnesses have come forward and helped identify suspects but that there are "definitely" more people involved.
He urged anyone who has information about the brawl to share it with the police.
"This can't go on," Fitzpatrick said. "Your friends are dying while you stand there and video it. This is egregious. "

Newsday has published an update with new information related to this story. In addition, please make sure the article featured in this Student Opinion question is appropriate for your classroom.
Have you ever witnessed an event where someone was in danger? Did you, or anyone else, come forward to help?
Why do you think bystanders sometimes go out of their way to help acquaintances and strangers alike? Why do you think they sometimes don’t — and instead just watch from the sidelines?
In “Oceanside Stabbing: After a Brawl, Teenagers Gawked as a Boy Lay Dying,” Sarah Maslin Nir and Arielle Dollinger write about an episode that shocked officials in the Long Island community where it occurred:
A wild after-school brawl erupted on Monday outside a Long Island strip mall, and when it was over, a 16-year-old student was gravely wounded with a stab wound to his chest.
But most of the 50 or so teenagers in Oceanside, N.Y., who either took part in the fight or witnessed it made no attempt to defend him. In fact, some stood by recording the fight and his suffering on their cellphones, the police said.
The victim, Khaseen Morris, died at the hospital.
“Kids stood there and didn’t help Khaseen,” Detective Lt. Stephen Fitzpatrick of the Nassau County Police Department said in a news conference on Tuesday. “They videoed his death instead of helping him.”
The article continues:
The fatal fracas started at about 3:30 p.m. on Monday and was precipitated by a dispute over a girl, and whom she was dating, according to the detective.
The teenagers were all from around the neighborhood, he said, and had gathered at the strip mall on Brower Avenue, a popular hangout where the confrontation was supposed to occur. Khaseen was aware of the dispute, and that other boys were coming to the strip mall, Detective Lt. Fitzpatrick said.
Witnesses at the mall said a car drove up, then a group of boys emerged and rushed Khaseen and his friends. Video footage shows Khaseen collapsing to the ground, as teenagers around him film his fall but do not come to his aid, the police said.
The police arrived at about 4 p.m., after a 911 call. Khaseen was taken to a hospital in critical condition and died of his stabbing wounds overnight, according to information provided by the police. One other boy sustained a fractured arm, and others had minor injuries. The girl was not present at the fight, Detective Lt. Fitzpatrick said.
Students, read the entire article, then tell us:

- What is your reaction to the details in the article?

- Unless you were there, you can’t know the full story. Yet based on what you read in the article, why do you think no one intervened in this case — either during the fight, or before the fight even took place (when at least some teenagers knew in advance that a confrontation was going to occur)?

- Do you think bystanders have a responsibility to intervene when they witness wrongdoing? Are they at fault if they don’t intervene? Why?

- Have you ever been a bystander when somebody has gotten hurt, either physically or verbally? What did you do? Why did you make that decision?

- Did you ever know in advance that something bad or dangerous, like an after-school fight, was going to take place in the near future? What did you do with that knowledge? What responsibility do you think teenagers have to tell teachers or other responsible adults about possible dangerous situations that are likely to happen?

- How do you know when you should get involved, offer to help or speak out — and when you shouldn’t?

- There is a term in psychology called the “bystander effect,” which occurs “when the presence of others discourages an individual from intervening in an emergency situation.” People think to themselves, no one else is intervening, so why should I? In fact, the premise is that the more people there who are watching something bad happen, the less likely that anyone will intervene. Do you think the bystander effect helps to describe the crowd’s behavior during this tragic fight? Do you think there is a way to prevent the bystander effect from occurring during emergencies like this one?

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Do-it-yourself experiences are popping up all over Long Island, giving crafty kids the opportunity to learn new skills and create Pinterest-worthy projects, edible sweets and more.
Sew pajamas, pillows and stuffed animals
Future fashion designers can get their start at Little Miss Sew It All, 287 Wading River Rd. in Manorville, a studio that teaches students who are in Kindergarten and older to sew. Kids can walk in and get one-on-one sewing lessons from an instructor. Kids can choose to sew pieces such as plush animals (a pig, a dog, a ladybug, a turtle and more), a circular pillow, a fish backpack, a set of pajamas or an article of clothing such as pants or a shirt. They can also ask an instructor to create a unique item, such as a Minecraft pillow. The studio provides sewing machines and fabric featuring polka dots, flowers and other prints, as well as bold neon colors. It typically takes sewers-in-training 45 minutes to an hour to finish one sewing project, but some parents opt to drop their children off for the entire day, allowing kids to sew three or four different pieces. 
INFO Noon to 4 p.m. Saturdays during the school year and from noon to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday in the summer; $36.99 for an hour drop-in, $24.99 per hour for two or more hours, $19.99 per hour for the whole day; 631-909-3855, littlemisssewitall.com
Make your own ice cream 
Instead of watching someone else scoop ice cream, kids can make their own from scratch at CoolMess, 1512 Old Northern Blvd. in Roslyn. The process is easy: Once families are seated, an ice-cream machine will be brought to their table. Guests choose from a vanilla or chocolate liquid ice-cream base, add it to the churn and watch it freeze solid. Then kids can add three out of 24 toppings, which include M&M's, Snickers, gummy bears, hot fudge, caramel, brownies, cookies, fruit and more. Rainbow sprinkles and whipped cream are complimentary. Anything that isn't eaten on-site can be taken home in to-go cups. Kids can also enjoy a cereal bar, premade ice cream and gelato, a candy wall and a play area equipped with a giant Connect 4. There is a full menu featuring burgers, salads and more.
INFO Noon to 8 p.m. Sundays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m. Thursdays and noon to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; $29.99 for one batch of ice cream, which feeds up to three people and comes with three toppings, rainbow sprinkles and whipped cream; 516-801-2665, coolmess.com/roslyn
Build a terrarium with succulents
Take gardening to a new level at the Modern Terrarium Bar, 8 S. Park Ave. in Rockville Centre, where kids ages 5 and older can build their own terrarium with a small succulent. Guests choose a succulent, such as a mini cactus, air plant or aloe, and then will be guided through how to plant it in unique vessels such as mugs, glass jars and geometric hanging planters. Charcoal, gravel and soil come with each terrarium but decorative elements can be added on as well, including healing crystals, large rocks, multicolored sand, sea shells, covered moss and sea glass. The plant bar hosts terrarium-building workshops that teach children about plant care while they decorate their pots.
INFO 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and noon to 5 p.m. Sundays; the DIY package starts at $27 and includes a pot, charcoal, gravel, soil and one small plant; customers can choose a larger pot for an additional cost and add-ons such as multiple plants, multicolored sand, crystals and more ranging from 25 cents to $5.23; 516-608-0635, modernterrariumbar.com
Bead your own bracelets and make your own beauty products 
ReCreateU, 19 S. Village Ave. in Rockville Centre, which is run by the owners of the terrarium bar, makes designing jewelry and going to the spa accessible to kids with its bracelet bar and beauty bar. When accompanied by an adult, kids ages 5 and older can take part in either activity. At the bracelet bar, kids choose to make a 6-, 7- or 8-inch bracelet with a charm. Multicolored "empowerment beads" are used to string the bracelet together. The owners say each bead has a meaning - for example, amazonite promotes clarity and pyrite promotes health - which kids are taught about by the store's experts. For the DIY beauty bar experience, kids can make their own body scrubs, bath soaks, bath bombs, face masks, rose water facial sprays, room sprays and essential oil perfumes. For each product, kids can add their favorite scents and essential oils, such as lavender, grapefruit, lemon and rosemary.
INFO 11 to 6 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays; 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursdays; 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; noon to 5 p.m. Sundays; $20 for the DIY bracelet and beauty bar packages; 516-678-8886, recreateu.com
Make five different types of slime 
Little slime lovers won't be able to get enough of The Lanyard Ladies, 433 Merrick Rd. in Oceanside, a DIY destination where kids can make up to five different types of slime, including one made with glue and another made with shaving cream. They also can add a variety of colors to their slime, as well as beads, gems, jewels and sparkles. All the ingredients are given to kids to make the slime by themselves, and they can decorate the containers, too. There also are lanyard and friendship bracelet workshops, as well as seasonal crafts for Valentine's Day, Halloween and the winter holidays.
INFO Check the monthly online calendar for specific days and times of the workshops, which are held twice a week from September to June, during school breaks and throughout the summer; $20 for each workshop, but discounts are available if parents sign up children for multiple classes; 516-578-2248, thelanyardladies.com
Customize home décor 
Kids can spruce up their rooms by making trendy, HGTV-style home décor at AR Workshop's three Long Island locations: Bellmore (2930 Merrick Rd.), Port Washington (273 Main St.) and Smithtown (83 East Main St.). The studio offers family "crafternoons" throughout the year, which are workshops where kids and parents work together, as well as specific kid-friendly classes each week. Included in the cost of the workshops are the materials, guidance from instructors and the finished product. Workshops include decorating pillows or tote bags with multicolored paint and stencils; staining, sanding and painting game boards (chess or checkers); creating wood-plank signs and accessory boards; knitting chunky yarn blankets and pillows, and more.
INFO Check each location's online calendar for dates and times of family "crafternoons" and kid-friendly workshops; youth projects start at $40; Port Washington, 516-247-6452, arworkshop.com/portwashington; Bellmore, 516-780-0135, arworkshop.com/bel

Preserving Polish pride: LI kids learn about their heritage at special schools

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eliza Pszeniczny jokes that she's not her children's favorite person on Saturday mornings. "They don't really like me when I wake them up on Saturday when all their friends are in pajamas until noon," says Pszeniczny, 40, an office manager from Wantagh.
But if it's Saturday at the Pszeniczny household, it's time for Polish school.
Natalia, 14, and Konrad 11, attend the Saint Ladislaus Polish School in Oceanside, one of more than a half-dozen Polish supplementary schools on Long Island that meet for three or four hours on Saturdays to teach the language, culture, song, dance, history and geography of Poland. Pszeniczny is a substitute teacher there.  
"I always wanted them to be able to communicate with my family when we go to visit," says Pszeniczny, who moved to the United States from Poland when she was 17 years old, and whose husband, Robert, 44, a contractor, also was born in Poland. "Thanks to the school, they're fluent. They can get themselves ice cream in a foreign country. They don't need me. It's amazing. They have an American accent, obviously, but they can communicate with absolutely no issues."
TEACHING A NEW GENERATION
Polish schools keep the heritage of the country alive for a new generation born in the United States for whom Polish is typically a second language, says Agata Strzelichowski, director of the Paderewski Polish School of Glen Head, which will celebrate its 90th anniversary in 2020.
That task used to be easier, she says. "In the early days, the parents both were Polish. But more and more, our parents are bilingual in the sense that one is Polish and the other is American. It's much harder to maintain the language." This year, the school also opened a class for students whose parents don't speak Polish; it has five students, ages 10 to 15, Strzelichowski says. Tuition for the schools runs from about $430 to $500 per child per year, with some sibling discounts, and may include additional items such as books or field trips. Students who complete the program "graduate" from the schools.
"I like that I get to be a part of the Polish society," says Natalia Pszeniczny, a high school freshman who now helps with a class of the youngest students. "You get to be with all your friends and family, and you have a common topic." Many of the schools meet at a church that might offer services in Polish, but students don't have to share the religion or even Polish to attend a school, school officials say.
STUDENTS CAN EARN COLLEGE CREDIT
Students who attend the school typically will take the Languages Other Than English exam - known as LOTE - to try to qualify for three- to six language credits they can apply to their college requirements, school officials say. If they are dual American and Polish citizens, they also may be able to attend college in that country for free, school officials and parents say. 
Earlier this month, several of the schools marched in the 82nd annual Polish-American Pulaski Day Parade on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
Here are some of the Long Island schools:
Saint Ladislaus Polish School, Oceanside
Meets at St. Anthony's Roman Catholic Church, 88 Anchor Ave. Cost is $430 per child; $580 for two children. For information, call 516-743-1878.
"We have Polish language and culture, singing and dancing once a week," says Margaret Gradzki, principal. The school currently has 38 students who meet from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays from September to May; they are grouped in four levels with ages running from 3 years old to 14. "After that, they graduate from the Polish school," says Gradzki of Farmingdale. 
Paderewski Polish Supplementary School, Glen Head
Meets at St. Hyacinth's Roman Catholic Church, 319 Cedar Swamp Rd. Cost is $450 to $550 per child. For more information, call 516-399-0565 or visit polskaszkolaglenhead.org.
"Our school is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, school on Long Island," says Agata Strzelichowski, director. The school opened in 1930; its 50 students meet from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on 30 Saturdays during the academic year. Members of the school community especially enjoyed their march in the Pulaski Day Parade in Manhattan on Oct. 6 because this year the parade honored Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the prime minister, statesman, composer and musician for whom their school is named, Strzelichowski says.
Zbigniew Herbert Polish Supplementary School of Long Island, Copiague
Meets at two venues. Pre-K and kindergarten students meet at 1721 Great Neck Rd.; students in first through 11th grades meet at Our Lady of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church, 1 Molloy St. Cost is $510 per student, with discount for siblings. For information, call 631-793-9532, polskaszkolacopiagueli.org
This is the biggest Polish school on Long Island with about 530 students. "We are so big because the community in the area is very big," says Dorota Szczech, director. The school has two shifts for each age group. Pre-K and kindergarten meet 8:45 a.m. to noon and 12:20 to 3:35 p.m.; the older students meet 8:30 to 11:45 a.m. and then noon to 3:15 p.m. "Most of the students are born here and they come to our school already speaking Polish.They know conversational Polish. We teach them to read and write," Szczech says. The school also teaches history and geography. "We also have a class for Polish as a second language. It's about twenty students. This group is growing." For the first time this year, the school is offering Polish as a second language classes for adults on Monday evenings.
Polish Supplementary School of St. Hedwig's, Floral Park
Meets at St. Hedwig's Church Parish Hall, 309 Jericho Tpke. Cost is $430 per child. For more information, call 516-851-0523.
The school day starts with the children singing the national anthem of Poland, says director Dorota Kaczmarzyk.  The song is called "Dabrowski's Mazurka," or, in English, "Poland Is Not Yet Lost." "It's an accomplishment for these children to be there every Saturday. We are so proud of the little ones when they are singing ... It's so beautiful," she says. The school, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, has 75 students from age 4 to eighth grade and meets from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Saturdays.
Polish Supplementary School of Long Island, Hicksville
Meets at Trinity Lutheran School, 40 W. Nicholai St. Cost is $440 per child, $820 for two children. For more information, call 516-509-7491 or visit polskaszkolalongisland.com.
"Our school was established by Polish parents two years ago. It's a pretty new school, one of the newest on Long Island, in New York," says director Maria Preiss. School is in session from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and currently has 55 students from preschool through eighth grade.
Polska Szkola, Riverhead
Meets at St. John Paul II Regional School, 515 Marcy Ave. Cost is $500 per student. For information, call 631-988-5967 or visit polskaszkolariverhead.com.
"We teach the Polish language, culture, history and geography of Poland," says Ewa Zalusinska. The school has 150 students, who meet from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturdays.
St. Ladislaus Polish School, Hempstead
Meets at the Polish National Club, 329 S. Peninsula Blvd. Cost is $350 per student. For information, call 646-331-0598 or visit pshempstead.com.
The school teaches the Polish language, geography, traditions, singing and dance, says director Barbara Karolak. The school even once taught mathematics, she says. The school's 16 students meet from 9:30 a.m.

WAITING FOR HELP: WHY MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR SOME LI PATIENTS IS DELAYED FOR MONTHS

Author: Reich-Hale, David

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]07 Apr 2019: 33.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2204136000?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A shortage of mental health professionals has forced some Long Islanders to wait months for an appointment, and patients who do get care without a delay often pay out of pocket because many psychiatrists, psychologists and other therapists don't take insurance.
Insurance reimbursements for those care providers are too low, and don't come close to those of several other medical specialties, experts at Long Island's largest health systems said.
And with demand for treatment high, psychiatrists often only treat patients who can afford to pay out of pocket.  That can mean hundreds of dollars for a 45-minute session.
Nearly 25 percent of respondents in a 2017 survey by Roslyn Heights-based North Shore Child and Family Guidance Center, a not-for-profit children's mental health agency, said they couldn't find a single provider who took their insurance.
"What makes the difficulty accessing care particularly difficult for people and families living with mental health and substance-use disorders is that stigma, and the shame it generates leads to delays in their asking for help in the first place," center executive director Andrew Malekoff said. "Some may wait weeks, months and even years to ask for help."
In addition, the lower insurance reimbursements have pushed medical students to choose fields other than psychiatry, said Dr. Kristie Golden, associate director of operations at Stony Brook Medicine. Golden said the demand won't be met unless "psychiatrists come up with ways to make a comparable living and pay off school debt."
There is also a broader economic cost. Depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion annually in lost productivity and absenteeism, according to the World Health Organization. But the organization said for every $1 spent on treating those disorders, there is a $4 return in better health and ability to work.
Local health systems are working to improve the situation by opening mental health care centers that accept insurance and locating mental health providers who take insurance within primary-care settings.
However, the shortage of providers is growing. The state Labor Department projected in 2012 that a 25 percent increase in psychiatrists and a nearly 30 percent increase in mental health therapists would be needed to meet demand from 2012 to 2022. 
According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, about 19 percent of adults in the United States, or 43.8 million people, experience some type of mental illness, such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder, in a given year. About 21 percent of teenagers experience a severe mental disorder at some point during their life, the group said. 
Against that backdrop, just 55 percent of psychiatrists nationwide accept insurance, according to a National Council for Behavioral Health advisory board, a Washington-based organization that advocates for the mental health profession. In comparison, more than 90 percent of primary-care physicians take private insurance or Medicare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care policy group.
Many psychiatrists "who do take insurance come to realize that there isn't enough time in the day to see patients and then handle all the paperwork, requests and denials that come with taking insurance," said Dr. Ronald Brenner, chief of behavioral health services for Catholic Health Services in Rockville Centre.
Although regional numbers are hard to come by, the percentage of psychiatrists who don't take insurance could be higher on Long Island, said Dr. Aaron Pinkhasov, chairman of the Department of Behavioral Health at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola.
"There are more people who could pay out of pocket, so it's a more feasible option for doctors in a region like this," Pinkhasov said.
But Long Islanders still have better access than residents of rural areas of New York and the nation, where finding providers is even more difficult, experts said. In metropolitan areas, there are 17.5 mental health providers per 100,000 people, according to an American Journal of Preventive Medicine analysis completed in 2016. The number of providers falls to 5.8 per 100,000 in non-metro counties. 
"It's all perspective, and we are used to an ease of entry, where we don't need to drive more than 10 minutes to get what we need," said Janet Kahn-Scolaro, administrative director for behavioral health and family medicine services at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside. "But even here it could be better."
Christine Sampson, 37, of Amagansett, said she traveled more than two hours to Hempstead, because she couldn't find a nearby psychiatrist who took her insurance without a long wait to make an appointment.
"It took me a month just to find a psychiatrist, and he was far away," she said. "I was desperate, so I did it."
Sampson, who has bipolar disorder, said she now sees a local psychiatrist and therapist, and her six medicines are covered by insurance. Her copay for mental health services is $70.
"One of my medicines would cost $900 without insurance," she said. "I'm fortunate that on my current insurance, I pay a $40 copay, and that's it."
Karen Garcia, 39, of Roslyn said she tried to find mental health treatment.  
"I really tried to get therapy, and in every case it was either too pricey or the waiting list was months long," she said. "I gave up." 
It can be even more difficult to find child psychiatrists who take insurance because there is a shortage of them in general, said Dr. Stephen Perret, who runs a private child psychiatry practice in Westbury.
"We come in to this profession to help people, so it's terribly frustrating that I can't take [insurance]," Perret said. "I wouldn't be able to cover the rent, never mind pay my employees, pay off my $200,000 in student loans or feed my family with the $60 insurance pays for a visit. The system is a mess."
Sheree Simmons of Brentwood, who is on Medicaid, said she pays $400 to $800 out of pocket every month for her daughter to see a psychiatrist in West Islip. The cost varies, depending on how often she needs to go.
"She also needs more counseling, but I can't afford it," Simmons said. "Very few people are taking Medicaid.
She said she calls her daughter "three or four times per day while she is at school to make sure she is all right. It's all very difficult."
The lack of providers can also be maddening for family practitioners who can't find the help needed for their patients, said Dr. Michele C. Reed, who has offices in Garden City and Rosedale, Queens.
"It's a daily issue," Reed said. "I routinely see patients, including children, who have anxiety issues. We try to find them a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker or therapist who can help. But unfortunately we often tell them to call their insurer, because mental health care providers can't accept what insurers are willing to pay. Also, usually patients who have insurance don't feel comfortable going to a hospital-based clinic because, more times than not, they don't feel like they'll get the same level of privacy and intimacy" that they would in a private practice.
Experts said reimbursements are lower because insurers struggle to quantify the cost for mental health care, which can vary widely for patients with similar diagnoses, depending on the type of treatment. There is also a long-standing lack of recognition that mental illness is as serious as physical illness, and can be tied to other illnesses, they said.
In an effort to make mental health services more accessible, some providers spend time - often at lower pay - at organizations that deliver services to those who can't pay for care.
For instance, in addition to his private practice, Perret works at the North Shore Child and Family Guidance Center.
"It's a mission for me, and for others," he said. "We give whatever we can to help people who need it but can't afford the care otherwise."
The center operates by raising between $1.5 million and $2 million a year through fundraising events, individual contributions and grants, executive director Malekoff said.
It accepts all insurance and treats between 5,000 and 6,000 children and their family members yearly, he said. The organization has eight full- and part-time psychiatrists on staff.
"Only through our fundraising are we able to ...  turn no one away for inability to pay and offer a rapid response with no waiting list," he said, adding that often families are desperate by the time they seek help.
Major health systems on Long Island are trying to make behavioral health care more accessible.
One strategy includes placing  mental health professionals, sometimes social workers or counselors, inside primary-care practices.
Other systems have opened full-service behavioral health practices that include psychiatrists and psychologists - and take insurance. While psychiatrists and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) are permitted to write prescriptions, psychologists can handle much of the care patients need, experts said.
South Nassau, which is part of the Mount Sinai Health System, has assigned a psychologist and bilingual social worker to provide behavioral health services at the Center for Primary and Behavioral Care in Hempstead and at a family medical practice in Oceanside. In less urgent cases a primary-care physician can manage the psychiatric medication in collaboration with a psychiatrist, Kahn-Scolaro, at South Nassau, said.
"For patients who require the specialist, the psychiatrist can handle the care directly," she added.
New Hyde Park-based Northwell Health operates a mental health care office, called Northwell Health Physician Partners Behavioral Health at Manhasset, which does take insurance.
"We plan to dot the landscape with this type of practice ... They're in great demand," said Dr. Blaine Greenwald, Northwell's vice chairman of psychiatry.
To make it work financially, psychiatrists at the Manhasset office see about 15 to 20 patients daily, and only treat people who need medication as part of their care, Greenwald said.
"The psychiatrist can spend 15 to 30 minutes with a patient without being hurried," he said. "The practice can't be financially viable if a psychiatrist spends their time doing psychotherapy too."
"Therapists see the patients for other services," he said.
Northwell Health and Stony Brook Medicine have embedded behavioral health professionals in various primary-care settings, Golden said.
Stony Brook also uses tele-psychiatry to deliver behavioral health care to patients on the East End, where there are fewer providers to meet the demand.
"It's easy and convenient for the patients," Golden said. "A patient goes to a primary-care location and they are seen by a remote behavioral health provider at Stony Brook."
New York State is expanding telehealth regulations to allow patients to be seen in a variety of locations, including their homes.
But there are federal restrictions that limit the reimbursement of these services to Medicare beneficiaries. A bill that would lift restrictions expired without a vote in 2018.
Catholic Health Services' Mercy Medical Center operates a behavioral health clinic in Garden City.
"We take everyone, and it can be difficult because it's overrun," said Brenner, who is in charge of the health system's behavioral health care. The facility handled 28,000 visits last year.
Brenner said CHS is also considering opening a clinic in Suffolk." "You'd think a clinic would be a profitable enterprise, but given the billing structure, it's far more complicated, and many clinics struggle," he said.
NYU Langone this year launched a corporate program in which companies contract directly with the Manhattan-based health system for mental health services.
"We negotiate directly with employers and then provide quality care for a fair level of compensation," said Dr. Charles Marmar, chairman of the psychiatry department at NYU Langone. "More than 100 behavioral health staff becomes in-network for employees."
Two large companies have signed on, and others have expressed interest, said Dr. David Ginsberg, the vice chairman of NYU Langone's psychiatry department.
"It's a very strong retention tool for companies," he said.

HERO HONORED POSTHUMOUSLY: ALVAREZ OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATE FOR FUND

Full text: Luis Alvarez, the cancer-stricken detective whose congressional testimony is credited with helping secure health care for thousands of fellow Ground Zero responders, was honored at a Brooklyn ceremony Tuesday marking the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
Alvarez's brother Phil and his son David lit a memorial candle at the Brooklyn Borough Hall ceremony after accepting a proclamation and receiving a standing ovation for Alvarez's NYPD service and his legacy in the fight for health benefits for responders sickened by toxins at the Ground Zero site.
"This is the first year of 9/11 that we don't have him with us," Borough President Eric Adams said of the 53-year-old, a father of three from Oceanside, who died June 29 of colorectal and liver cancer tied to his work at Ground Zero.
In June, Alvarez was cast into the national spotlight when he gave gripping testimony during a televised appearance in Washington D.C., about the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund amid congressional resistance to extend it. Alvarez testified beside activist/comedian Jon Stewart, with both making an emotional plea to extend the health care funding for first responders.
Phil Alvarez, speaking at Tuesday's ceremony, recalled getting the call three years ago that his brother was sick.
"He said, 'Bro, I got stage four cancer.' You're not supposed to get that call about your little brother," Phil Alvarez said, adding: "It took 15 years for this thing to catch up with him."
Phil Alvarez described how his brother then went about reaching out to fellow 9/11 responders to urge them to get checked out - a mission he continued on social media in the years to come.
"You gotta be there for each other," he recalled his brother saying. "You gotta stand tall for one another."
Phil Alvarez drove with his brother to Washington and sat behind his brother and Stewart during the testimony.
Alvarez started at the NYPD in 1990 and was later assigned to the bomb squad. He retired in 2010.
Alvarez went into hospice soon after testifying before Congress.
In July, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill to replenish the victim compensation fund to provide financial support for people who were hurt or who developed diseases after responding to the terror attacks. It will last until 2090.

Storm-damaged school may not be repaired by Sept. 4

Full text: Officials are unsure whether a Hempstead school struck by lightning that caused a roof fire Tuesday will be repaired by the first day of classes.
The reading room on the second floor of Prospect School had the most damage, officials said Wednesday. Seven surrounding classrooms, the adjoining hallway, ceiling and HVAC system have water damage as a result of firefighter's efforts to extinguish the blaze.
"We're hoping it doesn't delay the school opening," said Regina Armstrong, acting Hempstead superintendent.
As a precaution, Armstrong is working with the New York State Commissioner of Education and the Nassau Board of Cooperative Educational Services to find an alternative site should the building not be ready for the first day of school on Sept. 4.
The reading room is used to hold classes for students who are slightly below grade level as part of the school's Academic Intervention Service program. Additionally, the classroom housed more than a thousand books, electronic smart boards and computers.
Armstrong would not give an estimate on damages but confirmed appraisers were on site.
More than 500 kindergarten students are enrolled at Prospect School, which also has two prekindergarten classes.
There were two custodians working in the building Tuesday night and one of them alerted the fire department.
The Hempstead Fire Department responded to a call a little after 9 p.m. At least 11 fire departments responded, including Mineola, Oceanside and West Hempstead. The fire was extinguished at 11:30 p.m., according to the Hempstead Fire Department.
"We are grateful of the number of responders that came out. It was show of brotherhood and camaraderie," Armstro

'RHOBV' star Richards marries again

Full text: Actress and new "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" reality-show cast-member Denise Richards was married for a second time on Saturday.
"So this happened 9-8-18 @aaronwilliamcameron," Richards, 47, posted on Instagram Sunday afternoon from Malibu, California, with a photo of a heart drawn in oceanside sand that enclosed two silver wedding bands. Richards, the former wife of actor Charlie Sheen, married Aaron Phypers, who also goes by Aaron William Cameron and is the ex-husband of actress Nicollette Sheridan.
"Hi, I'm Denise Richards and yep, the rumors are true," Richards had said Saturday in a 14-second video posted by Bravo, which airs the "Real Housewives" franchise. "This is my husband Aaron, and we just got married." Phypers echoes cheerfully, "We're married!" and the two kiss.
She also said in a statement to Bravo, "I am so happy to officially be married to the love of my life. I can't wait for everyone to go on this incredible journey with me this season on 'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.' It has been a wild ride so far!"
The two began dating in December 2017, months after Phypers' divorce from Sheridan. He and "Desperate Housewives" star Sheridan had married in December 2015 but separated after six months. The couple had no children.
Richards -- who was Bond girl "Dr. Christmas Jones" in the 1999 James Bond adventure "The World Is Not Enough" and has a string of TV and film credits stretching to 1990 -- married Sheen on June 15, 2002, shortly before he began his long-running sitcom "Two and a Half Men." The couple had daughters Sam and Lola, now 14 and 13, but separated in early 2005. Their divorce was finalized on Nov. 30 the following year. Richards in 2011 adopted a third child, infant daughter Eloise.
Sheen, who did not attend his Richards' wedding, said through a representative to "Entertainment Tonight that he "wishes them both nothing but happiness!"

Full text: In an election full of political newcomers and frustration with conventional politics, this race embodies the moment. Democrat Juan C. Vides, 41, of Oceanside, is a small-business owner who "couldn't sit on the sidelines" any longer. He's an immigrant from El Salvador offended by the president's rhetoric around immigration, and he is interested in improving gun-safety laws as well as the state's use of technology, from better messaging to streamlined voter registration.
GOP incumbent Melissa L.
Miller, 54, of Atlantic Beach, first ran in 2016. Her background as a stay-at-home mom to a special-needs child has driven much of her work on the mental health committee, where she sponsored several bills advocating for those with disabilities, including securing funds for a study of adult changing stations in public buildings for those who are disabled.
She also has supported ethics reforms like term limits and stripping pensions from corrupt officials, and she has been a voice on environmental issues unique to her district, like extending deadlines and improving communication for the New York Rising program.
While Vides brings a fresh perspective, Miller has been a responsive legislator. In a new term, we hope she expands her advocacy beyond her passion for disability rights and continues to use her voice for issues like ethics reforms.
Newsday endorses Miller.

A FORMER YANKEE BATBOY HONORS ANOTHER AT PLAY

One former Yankee batboy honored another Sunday at the Argyle Theater in Babylon.
At the premier of his play "Batboy: A Yankee Miracle," Ray Negron recognized Suffolk County Sheriff Errol Toulon Jr. for being the first African-American named to his position.
"I didn't expect this," said Toulon, who as a teenager in the South Bronx worked as batboy for the Yankees. I was just coming when he first told me" about the play. "But he wanted to honor me for my accomplishments."
The play, which is dedicated to law enforcement, is about a young boy who learns to laugh and cry with his heroes. Students from Oceanside High School starred in the one-day performance.
It's based on the life of Negron, who was caught spray-painting the outside of Yankee Stadium by then team owner George Steinbrenner. Instead of having Negron arrested, Steinbrenner hired him as a batboy during the 1970s "Bronx Zoo" Yankees era.
The play tells of Negron's experience growing up and living his dream.
Negron was a batboy for the Yankees seven or eight years prior to Toulon, but was still working in the clubhouse when they met.
Toulon, who was elected Suffolk sheriff in November, and the Silver Shield Foundation, an organization founded by Steinbrenner that helps pay for the education of children of fallen police officers and firefighters, were recognized at the premier.
"You're talking about a guy that's a great person; a guy who has battled cancer," Negron said of Toulon, who has survived two bouts with cancer - lymphoma in 1996 and pancreatic in 2004.
Toulon said working for the Yankees helped shape his personal life and career.
"It was a great experience being with the Yankees," the sheriff said. "I really learned a lot about professionalism, integrity and also how to do things the right way."
Some who attended said the honor was in good spirit.
"It's a nice honor and positive message," said Rockville Centre resident Kelly Carney. "I think law enforcement should be respected and hono

Full text: Lynbrook Mayor Alan Beach on Monday appointed a new trustee and gave the title of deputy mayor to another trustee after the death of Mayor William Hendrick in October.
The new trustee, Robert Boccio, is to serve until the village's special election in March, according to village spokeswoman Leslie Rothschild.
Boccio, a registered Republican, is filling Beach's former trustee seat. As the former deputy mayor, Beach became mayor after Hendrick's death.
Beach designated Trustee Hilary Becker as the board's new deputy mayor.
"Trustee Boccio is a good man, a family man, community leader, loving husband and father, and I am confident in the role that Trustee Boccio will fulfill to keep Lynbrook moving forwards with thriving, new, extraordinary efforts towards revitalization and I thank him for his dedication to serve Lynbrook and all her residents," Beach said in a statement Tuesday.
Hendrick had been the village's mayor since his appointment in January 2011 after serving as a trustee from 1989 to 1993 and 1995 to 2010. He died at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside on Oct. 11 following complications from a heart attack at the age of 64.
Boccio is an attorney with the Garden City firm Vigorito, Barker, Porter & Patterson LLP and specializes in high-exposure medical malpractice actions, nursing home defense cases and pharmaceutical defect matters, according to his biography on the law firm's website.
He ran unsuccessfully for village mayor in 2007 as a candidate for the Independence Party. During the campaign, Boccio denied allegations by an opponent whom he would not identify that he was forced out of his New York City job in 2005 after he allegedly doctored statistics concerning weapons and drug seizures at the city juvenile detention facility he ran in the Bronx, according to previous Newsday stories.
Boccio has served as a member and chairman of the village's Board of Ethics and its Board of Zoning Appeals, as well as an assistant village prosecutor, Rothschild said in an email.

Film historian shares passion for Hollywood's golden age in entertaining presentations

Author: Bubbeo, Daniel

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]18 June 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For cinema buffs, one memorable line comes during the fade-out of the fan-favorite classic "Casablanca," when Humphrey Bogart tells Claude Rains, "Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
That line also sums up Philip Harwood's love affair with the movies, a lifelong romance that began in the summer of 1970. "I went to see a lot of films that summer," says Harwood, 53, of Levittown. "I remember vividly seeing 'Patton,' 'The Out-of-Towners,' 'Airport.' My family took me to see films that you typically wouldn't take a 6-year-old to see."
Though he admits he nodded off during the World War II action comedy "Kelly's Heroes," the other movies all made an impression on him. "I still remember that scene in 'Airport' with Gary Collins where the fuselage was dangling over his head," he adds.
Flash-forward to 2017. Now he's the one screening movies as a film scholar and instructor who lectures and teaches courses at Long Island libraries, Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington, LIU Post's Hutton House in Brookville and the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan. On Tuesday, he'll talk about best actress Oscar winners, from Janet Gaynor to Emma Stone, in "It's Showtime! The Ladies of the Academy Awards" at the Oceanside Library at 2 p.m. (See box for details and more programs.)
For the June 20 lineup, a mix of film clips and discussions of the actresses and their work, Harwood will celebrate the centennial of such Oscar winners as Joan Fontaine, Jane Wyman and Susan Hayward, who were born in 1917.
Though most programs are Harwood's ideas, occasionally he fulfills requests. For a Hutton House Lecture series, he was asked to profile the films of blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, tied to the release of the 2015 biopic "Trumbo" with Bryan Cranston. For a 92nd Street Y series called "The Ideal President," he screened "Dave" (1993), "The American President" (1995) and "Air Force One" (1997), one of his rare forays into contemporary films. His lectures usually start with a 10-minute intro about the film being shown, and a discussion with the class after the screening.
"They tend to have questions on the lives of actors, but they also often will have a memory of something that triggers their senses based on the film," Harwood says. "They might remember where they saw it, or a certain incident tied to it."
A screening of "Gentleman's Agreement," Elia Kazan's 1947 drama about anti-Semitism, drew firsthand accounts from audience members about how situations in the movie reflected their own experiences with bigotry. "That's the wonderful thing about the post-film discussion in that it really becomes an interactive experience between instructor and class," he says.
Harwood has a particular fondness for films from the silent era and the golden age of the Hollywood musical from 1933 to 1958 featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland and Gene Kelly. Discussions also tap into his knowledge of actors, directors and production back stories on the films, such as his presentation last month at the Cinema Arts Centre on the making of "Singin' in the Rain."
"He has a seemingly endless reservoir of facts and observations at his fingertips," says Dylan Skolnick, the theater's co-director. "He presents things in a very accessible and entertaining way. Philip is a great movie buff and his shows are kind of like a movie, very well written and well paced. He also has a charming and irresistible personality that people really love."
Making of a movie maven
If Harwood's life were a movie, it would probably open with a flashback to West Hempstead, where he grew up, in the 1970s. One of his influences was his brother, Mark, who introduced him to both the world of horror movies like "The Curse of Frankenstein" (1957) and, rather primitively, the world of moviemaking.
"My brother was making films in Super 8," Harwood says. "He made his version of 'The Ten Commandments,' but with G.I. Joe dolls, and he created his own stop-motion figures. We would also do films like 'The Legend of Excalibur,' where I was Arthur Gluttony who became King Arthur."
At 8, Harwood began collecting books about movies and watching many of the golden-age classics on television. In high school, he wrote film reviews for the class newspaper and at Hofstra produced a weekly radio program on music from films and Broadway shows. His initial foray into a film studies program was as a volunteer teacher at the Harriet Eisman Community School in Long Beach, while also working in publishing sales. In 1997, he reached out to the New School in Manhattan about teaching a course. When an instructor who was scheduled to do a course on New York City directors backed out, Harwood was hired, and he's been on a roll since.
His gig with Hutton House, an LIU Post continuing education program for older adults, began in 2009 when he proposed a course to assistant provost Kay Sato. Impressed by Harwood's knowledge of film, she hired him.
"Like all of my professors, I observe and see how their classes are," Sato says. "Two months ago I sat in on his class on the movie 'San Francisco.' I loved how he tied in the history of the 1906 earthquake as well as the production history of the film," she says. "A lot of the people who come here are retired, and they've told me, I saw that movie in the '30s or '40s, but I never got so much out of it."
Preserving film
Many of the movies Harwood screens are from his collection of more than 700 DVDs. He says his greatest joy has been sharing his passion for films and keeping the legacies of Hollywood's golden age alive, especially among young audiences. In January, he became an adjunct professor at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, where his students are 19 to 22 years old.
"It's a different audience and they know their film," he says. "The first class, I asked, 'What's your favorite film and why?,' and they talked about Scorsese and Tarantino. But then some people said they enjoy seeing 'Funny Face,'" the 1957 Fred Astaire-Audrey Hepburn musical.
Asked what his favorite film is and why, Harwood has no quick answer. After much thought, he says, "I decide on 'Citizen Kane.' But it's not an easy choice. "I always think, what five films would I take to a desert island? You can see a film 1,000 times and see something different every time. It's like revisiting old friends."
And he's hoping his students become well acquainted with those films, and appreciate sharing them together.
"When you see a film with an audience, there's that camaraderie," he says. "The best way to see a film, especially, a comedy, is with an audience. When you watch it at home, you laugh by yourself, and it's not the same thing. Part of the experience of seeing a film in a theater is that you're sharing the joy, you're sharing the laughter together."

Police vehicle hits, injures 2 on sand in Long Beach, cops say

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two people were transported to the hospital after a Long Beach police vehicle apparently hit them on the beach Sunday night, police said.
Long Beach Police Commissioner Michael Tangney said the incident occurred at about 8 p.m. Sunday when a vehicle driven by a veteran officer on beach patrol came into contact with the pair - a man and woman in their 50s.
"At this point, we do not have confirmation that they were run over or struck, but there was alleged contact between a police vehicle and the two aided," Tangney said. "Both victims are alert, conscious and have full use of their extremities. At this point, none of the injuries appear to be very serious."
The victims were taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, Tangney said, and their relationship was not immediately known.
The officer was also transported to the hospital for what Tangney described as "trauma." The commissioner said he was unsure of the kind of vehicle the officer was driving, but it could have been an all-terrain vehicle or an SUV.
"I am very hopeful that this will only entail minor injuries and that everyone is fine going forward," said Tangney.

Eclipse-viewing glasses mostly sold out; beware of fakes

Author: Calavia-Robertson, Daysi

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 Aug 2017.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Long Islanders wanting to score a pair of safe eclipse-watching glasses may be out of luck.
Employees at several retailers on the Island said they are sold out of the special specs to view the sun Monday as it becomes obscured by the passing moon.
Retailers listed by the American Astronomical Society that sell glasses compliant with standards set by the International Organization for Standardization include 7-Eleven, Best Buy, Lowe's and Walmart.
Some stores said they've been sold out for as long as two weeks and are not expecting additional shipments.
As supplies have dwindled, online prices for eclipse glasses have skyrocketed. The glasses, most made of cardboard or plastic and originally priced as low as $1.98, are now listed by third-party sellers on Amazon.com for $99 or more for a set of "3 ISO 12312-2 compliant eclipse glasses for direct sun viewing."
Buyers beware: Not all glasses marketed as being "safe" or "ISO compliant" for the eclipse are actually safe. Last week, Amazon issued a recall on some glasses that did not meet safety standards.
Tony Iovino, supervisor of community services at the Oceanside Library, said the recall forced him to cancel an eclipse viewing event.
"Once Amazon informed us about the recall, we lost a huge part of our inventory and felt it was best to cancel," he said.
Rick Feinberg, press officer for the American Astronomical Society, said if you can't find safe protective eyewear, it's better to not watch the eclipse.
"The problem with the fakes is that we don't know if they've been tested properly," he said.
"They may not block enough ultraviolet and infrared radiation coming from the sun," he said. The radiation "can cook your retina without your even knowing it because there are no pain receptors there."
Feinberg said some of the eclipse glasses being sold online that are labeled as being ISO compliant for eclipse viewing (which should be marked with safety standard number ISO 12312-2) are actually marked with safety standard number ISO 12312-1, which is designated for "ordinary" sunglasses.
Ordinary sunglasses "are not made to be used for looking directly at the sun," he said. "Even looking at the sun for longer than a fraction of a second without proper protection is inadvisable."

Drinks: Hibiscus, more than just a pretty face

Full text: At Mamey Mexican Taqueria, which opened this summer in Babylon, co-owner Rosa Matute has a nightly ritual: She rinses dried hibiscus flowers, then combines them with cold water. The next day, she strains the cold-steeped tea and adds a hint of sugar for a barely sweet, summery drink called jamaica (pronounced "ha-my-ca") that sells for $2.55 a glass. " learned the recipe from one of her Mexican friends," said her daughter-in-law Erika Pancho, who translated.
In Mexico - as in China, the Caribbean, Africa and even Italy - ruby-hued hibiscus tea has long been a fixture, with purported powers to lower blood pressure, cleanse the kidneys, and ease digestion, among other health perks attributed to its floppy flowers.
Finding hot or iced hibiscus tea here in the United States, however, has sometimes entailed a hunt - or maybe hitting up a Jamaican eatery, where the tea is called sorrel. Is hibiscus finally taking its rightful place in our drinking lexicon?
With the market for so-called functional drinks - drinks with purported health benefits - growing, as well as hibiscus' tart, alluring flavor, it's becoming easier to find hibiscus in brewed form on Long Island.
The anthocyanins, or pigments, in hibiscus sepals are what lend hibiscus drinks a crimson hue, and make bottles of Montauk Beverageworks' Red Berry Hibiscus tea stand out in the Long Island markets where it's sold. Lexi Radziul, an administrator with the company, said the year-old formula is a strong seller, particularly with diabetics who value its low sugar content. Hibiscus is also a key ingredient in the Berry Hibiscus kombucha made by Oceanside's Coastal Craft Kombucha, and shows up in brewed iced teas at coffee shops across Nassau and Suffolk.
For those who like to blend their health regimen with a buzz, Bay Shore's Destination Unknown Beer Company pours a guava-and-hibiscus laced Waikiki Wheat beer, a faintly coral, floral brew with an astringent edge. Elsewhere in town, The Brewers Collective uses hibiscus in Loot, an "herbal ale" that's also brewed with sage and lemon balm.
Just don't try to replicate any of these drinks with the hibiscus growing in your garden: Hibiscus has 222 or so varieties, and the one used for tea and other drinks comes from tropical Hibiscus sabdariffa, and not the zone-7 perennial.

Budget proposal has $6M for roads, walks
Smithtown Supervisor Patrick Vecchio last week released a tentative $103 million budget for 2017 that includes more than $6 million in spending for road and sidewalk repairs.
Town property taxes for the average home assessed at $5,500 would be $1,269.88, a $1.37 decrease from last year that stays within New York State's tax levy cap of .68 percent. The town would raise $55.49 million from property taxes, unchanged from last year, with the total assessed value of property up slightly.
"The supervisor didn't use any one-shotters," Comptroller Donald Musgnug said. "This is a structurally balanced budget."
The budget would slightly increase spending for senior citizen programs and for parks and beaches.
More than 7,000 LED lights installed in streetlights for main roads and residential streets this year are expected to offer continued energy savings, with $270,000 in projected electricity costs for 2017, down from $460,000 in 2015, before the new lights were installed.
Musgnug said he expected the town would also save by renting instead of buying heavy equipment and vehicles, spending less money upfront and shrinking the 192-vehicle fleet because less downtime will be needed for maintenance.
The annual budget hearing is scheduled for Oct. 27 at 7 p.m. at Eugene A. Cannataro Senior Citizen Center, 420 Middle Country Rd.

Town withholds trick-or-treat permit
The Smithtown Town Board will seek assurances from a Commack church before approving a special event permit for an Oct. 29 children's trick-or-treat event that drew criticism from neighbors last year.
Complaints on a petition read into the record at the town board meeting Tuesday included "chaos in the street," discarded diapers, fights and parking violations at last year's event outside the church, known as Church Unleashed, at 83 Shirley Court.
"You'll need to get an action plan to see how it won't affect the neighborhood," Deputy Supervisor Thomas McCarthy said. "Until you have that, I don't see how the board could approve it."
Church Unleashed pastor Todd Bishop said that congregation members had picked up litter after last year's event and had quickly corrected any parking violations. The church is pursuing parking with a shuttle service from nearby Mayfair Shopping Center, he added.
"I'm disappointed by that and shocked" by the town board's reluctance to approve the event, he said, noting that his church was revitalizing a former synagogue used mainly in recent years by loitering teenagers.
Supervisor Patrick Vecchio appeared unswayed. "Pastor, the burden is on you," he said.

JONES BEACH
Pancreatic cancer walk canceled
The Lustgarten Foundation's annual Pancreatic Cancer Walk scheduled for yesterday at Jones Beach in Wantagh was canceled, the sponsors said.
The walk and run was canceled "due to unsafe conditions at the beach."
"We have been advised that sadly we cannot hold the pancreatic cancer research walk today," the foundation said.
No rain date was announced. The foundation will post other options for volunteers on its website, www.lustgarten.org by midday today, spokeswoman Erin Stoeber said.

RIVERHEAD
Nonprofit offering
safe drug disposal
A Riverhead anti-substance-abuse nonprofit is offering residents the opportunity to safely dispose of medication during October.
The Riverhead Community Coalition for Safe and Drug-Free Youth, founded in 1979, is hosting takeback events during which town residents can drop off their medication starting at 8 a.m. on Oct. 14 at 1177 Osborne Ave. in Riverhead.
The event is in conjunction with the Town's S.T.O.P. Day (Stop Throwing Out Pollutants).
To date, the Riverhead group has collected more than 2,000 pounds of medication townwide through partnerships and collection efforts.
The coalition is also hosting two other take-back medication events on Oct. 22: one at 10 a.m. in the lobby of Peconic Bay Medical Center, and the other at 9:30 a.m. at the Flanders Community Center, 655 Flanders Rd. in Flanders.

HUNTINGTON
Rules for carnival
attractions changed
The Town of Huntington has approved an amendment to the town code affecting nonmechanical attractions at carnivals.
The proposal removes the existing requirement of one ride per quarter-acre for nonmechanical attractions such as slides, fun houses and bounce houses.
Additionally, nonmechanical attractions would not be counted in the number of rides that can exist at an event.
"Rock walls and other nonmechanical attractions are becoming more popular," said town board member Tracey Edwards, sponsor of the resolution. "This code change will allow our fire departments and other agencies that typically host fairs to utilize the space more efficiently."
The changes were approved at the Sept. 27 town board meeting by a 5-0 vote.

GLEN COVE
Hearing on non-city
parking enforcement
The Glen Cove City Council is holding a public hearing Thursday on a proposal to give police the authority to enforce traffic laws in 10 non-city-owned parking lots.
Police currently have that authority in six non-city lots. The plan to add 10 more lots to that list is meant to make enforcement more consistent, City Attorney Charles McQuair said. The lots are either privately owned or owned by the Glen Cove Housing Authority.
Currently, it's legally nebulous whether police can ticket a driver for speeding through a private lot or for parking in a fire lane, McQuair said.
The ordinance would make clear that police have that power.
Among the lots to be added are ones for supermarkets, drugstores, restaurants and a discount store.
The public hearing is scheduled to begin shortly after the start of the 7:30 p.m. Thursday council meeting at City Hall.
The meeting is on a Thursday instead of the typical Tuesday because observance of Yom Kippur begins at sundown tomorrow.

Cybercommunity
safety discussed
Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Beach) and a cybersafety advocate hosted a presentation at Oceanside High School on Thursday meant to educate students and parents about creating a responsible online community.
Katie Schumacher, founder of the "Don't Press Send" campaign, spoke about social media, balancing technology with life offline, how parents should protect their kids from dangerous activities online, and tech responsibility.
"Understanding the power of our words and actions and the effect they have on others is key to creating a safe and positive cyber community," Kaminsky said in a news release.
The presentation was part of October's National Bullying Prevention Month.

UPS delivers assault rifle instead of toy for Christmas

Abstract: Instead of a toy plane they were buying for their friend's son, they found a semi-automatic rifle, scope, stand, ammo clip and copies of an Arizona man's driver's license and concealed-weapons permit.

Full text:   OCEANSIDE, N.Y. - A New York couple was horrified when a UPS delivery that they thought was a Christmas present turned out to be an assault rifle. Newsday reported that Joel Berman opened the keyboard-sized case in front of his wife and 6-year-old granddaughter Wednesday night in Oceanside, on Long Island.
Instead of a toy plane they were buying for their friend's son, they found a semi-automatic rifle, scope, stand, ammo clip and copies of an Arizona man's driver's license and concealed-weapons permit.
They hustled their granddaughter out of the room and called police, who picked up the weapon.
Atlanta-based UPS says it's investigating the "highly unusual incident." The company says it accepts legal shipments of some firearms. It says shippers must meet certain requirements.

LI stores, developers on how retail is evolving

Abstract: "Many retailers have said that in markets where they have pulled out of their brick and mortar stores to focus solely online, that they have seen a dramatic drop from purchases," Joshua Weinkranz, president of the Northeast region of Kimco Realty Corp., a New Hyde Park-based real estate investment trust, said.

Full text:   Shopping centers and malls on Long Island and in the nation are evolving as stores get smaller, landlords add non-retail tenants such as medical clinics and gyms, and retailers move into mixed-use developments where residents live.
Behind the evolution are challenges that are forcing retailers and developers to adapt. Nationally, there's the rise of online shopping, and retailers are shrinking store footprints since the recession that ended in 2009. On Long Island, additional challenges include expensive real estate, long development lead times, and high utility and tax costs.
But the payoff that keeps attracting retailers to the Island is the region's high spending. The buying power is driven by the Island's median household income, which was $98,401 in Nassau County and $88,323 in Suffolk County in 2014 - nearly double the national figure of $53,482, according to the most recent census estimates.
"We have malls that are serving an affluent and highly dense population, so that's why some of them have exceptionally high retail numbers," said Marshal Cohen, retail analyst with The NPD Group, a Port Washington-based market research company.
While there are challenges here such as delays getting approvals, "if you can sort through that, the rewards of Long Island are also very fruitful," said Todd Magazine, a Port Washington native and president of Blink Fitness, which has opened eight locations on Long Island since 2012.
Using online and in-store selling
The Internet is eroding the "cash-and-carry mentality" that once drew hordes of shoppers into stores, Cohen said. Already, 24 percent of electronics and nearly 20 percent of toys and office supplies are purchased online - and that share is expected to grow to 40 percent within five years, he said.
To survive, retailers are combining their offline and online businesses. They are bulking up their websites and mobile apps, Cohen said.
"Many retailers have said that in markets where they have pulled out of their brick and mortar stores to focus solely online, that they have seen a dramatic drop from purchases," Joshua Weinkranz, president of the Northeast region of Kimco Realty Corp., a New Hyde Park-based real estate investment trust, said. He was speaking at a retail panel discussion in Melville on Thursday hosted by the Commercial Industrial Brokers Society of Long Island and The Retail Network. "A lot of retailers have realized that they need both," he said.
Although more than 90 percent of Target's sales happen in-store, company spokeswoman Kristy Welker said, Target also uses stores as local distribution centers. Website and app orders shipped to and from stores account for more than 30 percent of its digital sales.
"Stores play a critical role in on-demand shopping," Welker said.
Many consumers still want to "see, feel and touch" appliances and electronics before buying them, said Gregg Richard, chief executive of Farmingdale-based appliance and electronics retailer P.C. Richard & Son.
However, the chain is continually updating its website to make it easier for consumers to compare items and make purchases, Richard said.
"Customers want things quicker and easier, so we do try to stay ahead of that," he said.
Smaller stores
Large retailers such as Target, Walmart and Macy's are experimenting with smaller stores - in part because many customers prefer them for everyday shopping.
Target plans to open two new, smaller format stores, in Freeport and Elmont, in October. The locations, a 46,000-square-foot store at the Meadowbrook Commons shopping center and a 24,500-square-foot space at an Elmont shopping center near Belmont Park, will have a smaller merchandise selection than the chain's full-size stores, which are usually around 140,000 square feet.
Last summer, Macy's opened off-price stores called Macy's Backstage in the Lake Success Shopping Center in New Hyde Park and at the Melville Mall in Huntington. Macy's Backstage stores, which are a fifth of the size of a regular Macy's store, offer off-price, discount, clearance and full-price items.
For Lisa King, of Old Bethpage, who was shopping Friday at Macy's Backstage at the Melville Mall, the smaller stores are more convenient than sprawling department stores.
"It's not overwhelming," said the 45-year-old substitute teacher. "Don't give me the mall."
Mixed uses
Retailers, food establishments and other businesses are also opening in mixed-use developments, which combine retail, office space and apartments.
"The future of Long Island as far as retail goes is the mixed-use projects that we see throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties," Robert E. Sandler, a commercial real estate attorney and partner in the Farrell Fritz law firm in Uniondale, said at the retail panel Thursday in front of a crowd of about 75 people.
About 60 percent of the retail space has been leased in Wyandanch Village, a complex that is being built near the community's rail station and is part of the $500 million Wyandanch Rising downtown revitalization project. Tenants include New York Community Bank, Domino's, Anthony's Pizza, Cricket Wireless, and K & B department store, said Jayson Siano, managing principal of Garden City-based Sabre Real Estate Group, the retail leasing agent.
"The retailers and businesses have a built-in audience if they are in the base of a project," Siano said.
Non-retail tenants
As retailers seek smaller spaces, malls and shopping centers have been renting to non-retail businesses such as urgent-care facilities, gyms, fast-casual restaurants and salons, to diversify the tenant mix and increase foot traffic.
"We realized that as the shopping center industry grew we had to find other ways of bringing shoppers to our center," said Steve Appas, part owner and director of real estate for Lighthouse Realty Partners, a Valley Stream-based developer and property management firm.
Diversification can benefit everyone.
Retro Fitness has opened 15 locations on Long Island since 2009 and recently signed a lease in Oceanside.
"Most people go to a gym two or three times a week so that's bringing additional people in" to shopping areas, said Rebecca Foth, vice president of real estate for Colts Neck, New Jersey-based Retro. Busy retailers, she said, "all can kind of feed off each other."
That's even true for medical facilities such as GoHealth Urgent Care, a chain of clinics operated by Great Neck-based Northwell Health. The chain operates 23 clinics in the metropolitan area, including 11 on Long Island.
"We like to locate ourselves where people live their everyday lives," said Adam Boll, who oversees ambulatory services at Northwell. Opening clinics in shopping centers, he said, "where it's easy for patients to be able to access us and not go out of their way, is a major priority for us."
Nationwide, malls and shopping center landlords are also incorporating movie theaters, bowling alleys, destination eateries, even common areas with benches and fire pits.
Retailers and the developers want a more "entertainment-oriented experience," said Brad Blumenfeld, vice president of Syosset-based Blumenfeld Development Group, a commercial developer of office and retail projects. "Even retail is becoming more experiential."
LI's development delays
Communities have gotten stricter about approving large retail locations in the last decade, leading to long delays.
"To get a new mall approved on Long Island - I think man is going to be living on Mars before then," Cohen said.
Municipal permitting rules tend to go without updates for years, which can lead to differing interpretations of how regulations apply to proposed projects, said Rob Loscalzo, chief operating officer of developer Tritec Real Estate Co. in East Setauket.
"In some cases it can delay your project for months or years," said Loscalzo, who oversees the leasing of retail space at Tritec's mixed-used New Village development in Patchogue.
New Village faced opposition from residents and neighboring businesses. Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri, who worked with Tritec to bring the $110 million, 291-unit project to the village's downtown, said it was possible to get approval because he has a longer term as mayor than most municipal officials.
"Most of your town supervisors and some of the other mayors are on for two-year terms," said Pontieri, who holds a four-year term. "With a two-year term, you can't even get a site plan approved or looked at by a planning board."
A couple of years ago, Walmart wanted to expand its grocery-focused Neighborhood Market - it opened one in Levittown in 2013 - to more than a dozen stores on Long Island. The stores are typically one-third the size of its regular stores. But the company gave up its bid because the approval process was too complicated, said Joseph A. Deal, principal of Hauppauge-based Bohler Engineering's New York metro region. Instead, the retailer went south, and his North Carolina office helped Walmart open 70 stores in the region about two years, he said at the retail panel.
Walmart declined to respond to Deal's assertions.
Persistence can, however, pay off. For more than a decade Neiman Marcus tried to open a store on the Island, including an ill-fated bid to be the anchor tenant at the 39-acre former Cerro Wire property in Syosset. The luxury retailer finally opened a store in February at Roosevelt Field mall.
"Everywhere we open a new store, we have a new set of challenges," Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Ginger Reeder said. "Luckily, our store planning team has many years of experience and has yet to find a challenge we could not handle." With Ken Schachter

Full text:   It's disturbing to see that a person who handles the legal problems of people with substance use problems doesn't understand opiate addiction .
Even more distressing is the family member whose letter of May 16 agreed .
Methadone and Buprenorphine - an opioid medication used to treat opioid addiction - are provided on an open-ended basis for a very good reason. Opiate addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. That means it is incurable.
Most persons with opiate addiction cannot maintain abstinence. Before methadone therapy, the family member's relative would probably have died.
Methadone programs are comprehensive, especially in New York, and there is no need to go into rehab. The services in a methadone program are better.
The question is, why is the relative still going to the methadone clinic three times a week? In New York, after three years, you can receive a month's take-home medication.
But you have to be compliant and doing something with your life. And you don't need to get off methadone for that. Methadone patients can do anything they are qualified for.

No way to handle disruptive behavior
What's wrong with this picture ?
A student appeared to be disruptive, refused to leave the classroom and put down his cellphone - but the teacher was suspended? This seems to be a situation ruled by political correctness. What a shame that other students lost class time because of one student's behavior. Teaching has become hazardous.

Checked-bag fee creates airport lines
Sen. Chuck Schumer's suggestion to increase the number of security screening dogs to alleviate the long wait times for air passengers is certainly a valid and sensible solution .
However, the airlines themselves are partly to blame for the longer wait times at security. Most airlines now charge a hefty fee for checked baggage. Because of this, people are using more, larger and questionable carry-on bags to avoid the additional expense. This only increases the time to clear everyone's belongings.
This also increases the time for boarding.
I hope the pre-check screening program - an $85 fee good for five years - is not a simply a ploy to raise revenue for the Transportation Security Administration. I have purchased this, but the real hold-up results from the checked baggage fee. If checked bags were free again, you'd see shorter wait times.

Full text:   Parties should heed Trump and Sanders
Even though Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders have vastly different approaches to fixing what is broken in America, they both have appealed to the masses .
They appeal to the everyday citizen who has been put into a powerless position, and whose rights and needs have been ignored by both major parties for decades.
The groundswell of popular support for both presidential candidates seems to be a harbinger of major policy and platform changes that must take place in the reformation of both Republican and Democratic parties if they are to continue to exist.
Maybe it's time to say good bye to political bosses, and give a welcoming hello to the constituency the candidates for office are supposed to represent.

Health costs are up far more than 1.8%
The consumer cost chart in "StatPack" says medical care is up only 1.8 percent over last year. I just received a notice from Oscar Health Insurance that my premium will go up 21 percent next January.
I was forced to change health plans when the Affordable Care Act kicked in, and that first year my health plan rates escalated 28 percent. And, to boot, the deductibles are so high the health plan doesn't cover anything for months.

Take care that old pipe is reliable
The idea of saving hundreds of millions of dollars by discharging sewage from Nassau County's Bay Park treatment plant into the ocean through the Cedar Creek outfall pipe seems wonderful .
I wonder whether relying on an underground steel pipe that's more than 100 years old will be a problem. Just ask the residents in Oceanside who had three feet of water in the streets outside their homes on May 16 when a water main broke.

Dogs' indoor parks, play spaces and day care on Long Island

Abstract: A GYM - FOR DOGS WHEN|WHERE 11 a.m. -9 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekends at The Martial Arfs Dog Training & Fitness Center, 251 Voice Rd., Carle Place COST Classes from $30 ($190 monthly unlimited) INFO 516-280-8331, martialarfs.com Dogs can get in the zone at daily indoor fitness and obedience classes, some with a martial arts spin (think KaRuffTe and PoochItSu).

Full text:   Note: Quotes:
For pups - and their people - who don't like the snow and cold, going to an outdoor dog park doesn't seem much fun in the winter. But furry friends have other options for socializing - book a play date, romp around an indoor dog park, hit the canine gym or spend the day at an upscale doggy day care / hotel.
Karen Dikeman drives 40 minutes from her home in Bayport to Martial Arfs in Carle Place so that her two English springer spaniels - Butch Cassidy, 9, and Jessie James, 11 - can get in some indoor activity.
Eight-year-old Coco, and her little sister, Reels, 4, can relate. Five days a week, the shih tzus get dropped off at Fido Fitness Club in Woodmere from their home in Oceanside for day care in the 4,000-square-foot space.
"My dogs are more like couch potatoes," says their owner, Peggy Punch, with a laugh. They "definitely do more running around here than they would ever do at home."
Here are some venues that you and your four-legged friend can experience during the colder months.
INDOOR DOG PARK
WHEN|WHERE 6 a.m.-7 p.m. weekdays, 8:30 a.m.-7 p.m. weekends at Fido Fitness Club, 910 Railroad Ave., Woodmere
COST $10 dog park; day care $40 full day, $25 up to 4 hours
INFO 516-569-3647, fidofitnessclub.com
The climate-controlled facility has a fence that separates large and small dogs, many of whom come for day care. But nonmember dogs are welcome to romp and play in the park, as long as their keepers stick around, says co-owner Ellen Adler. On Sundays, an agility course is set up with a weave pole, jumps, tunnels and a teeter-totter. Last month, the club recently launched a new day care / training program that teaches dogs - mostly puppies and older dogs - basic obedience techniques while in day care.
Pet owners too frazzled to deal with travel logistics can opt for the club's pooch taxi service, door-to-door pickup and drop-off ($10-$40).
PLAY DATES AND PRIVATE PARTIES
WHEN|WHERE By appointment, South Shore K9 Academy, 3468 Lawson Blvd., Oceanside
COST $60 for 30-minute play date for up to four dogs; private parties from $150 an hour.
INFO 516-208-6109, southshorek9academy.com
The newly opened school emphasizes training and fitness, but when classes aren't going on, owner Brandon Karp rents out the space to pet owners for a doggy play date, pet birthday party or even a "bark" mitzvah. "I set up water bowls, and there is doggy playground equipment out," says Karp. The space recently hosted a wheaten terrier meetup group and some dog birthday parties.
A GYM - FOR DOGS
WHEN|WHERE 11 a.m. -9 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekends at The Martial Arfs Dog Training & Fitness Center, 251 Voice Rd., Carle Place
COST Classes from $30 ($190 monthly unlimited)
INFO 516-280-8331, martialarfs.com
Dogs can get in the zone at daily indoor fitness and obedience classes, some with a martial arts spin (think KaRuffTe and PoochItSu). TreadSpin is a newer class that puts pooches on their own treadmill to work out at their own pace - natch, while facing a lead dog. "We practice obedience while they're on the treadmill," says founder Jeris Pugh. "It's a lot of fun and it really wipes the dogs out." Additional activities include a lure machine for canines that like the chase. There's a 10-foot-by-18-foot heated saltwater pool for both leisure and therapy.
DROP-IN AGILITY/HANDLING CLASSES
WHEN|WHERE 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Sundays (agility); 8 p.m. Tuesdays and 3:30 p.m. Thursdays (breed handling) at Doggie "U" K9 Academy, 1515D Fifth Industrial Ct., Bay Shore
COST $15 drop-in agility class; $10 breed handling class
INFO 631-968-7972, doggieuk9.com
Owners and dogs get more structured quality time together in this huge indoor space that offers drop-in breed handling and agility classes. The venue hosts many events throughout the year ranging from agility trials to breed match shows.
DOGGIE DAY CARE
Many pet boarding centers have begun offering a day care option for working pooch parents who want their dogs to get lots of activity and socialization during the day.
Guests at the newly opened Hydrant Pet Hotel in Riverhead run around a large indoor space equipped with lots of diversions. "Dogs that stay here learn about safe social behavior that translates into a cool, calm and collected neighborhood pup that minds his business and plays nice with others," says owner Anthony Pollina. "It also sends home a tired pup so they can just chill with Mom and Dad on the couch after a long day at work."
Dogs enrolling in day care programs must have proof of up-to-date vaccinations and are often evaluated for temperament before being released to play with others.
The Hydrant Hotel
WHEN|WHERE 7 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday and by appointment, 845 Raynor Ave., Riverhead
INFO 631-740-9359, hydranthotel.com
COST From $35
The 10,000-square-foot facility opened late last year - owners say a 2-foot wading pool and agility course should be finished by summertime.
Best in Show Pet Resort
WHEN|WHERE 7 a.m.-7 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturdays, noon-6 p.m. Sundays, 244 Herricks Rd., Mineola

Dogs play inside a two-story resort-inspired space complete with an elevator. Day care pups recently competed in the center's annual Puppy Bowl - complete with a tailgate party for dogs. Pet taxi service from $35.
Super Paws Dog Training
WHEN|WHERE 7 a.m.-7 p.m. daily, 2135 Jericho Tpke., Garden City Park
INFO 516-249-7297, superpawsk9.com

Dogs can run around and enjoy indoor play - then hit rest stations with beds for breaks. Natural grass stations encourage dogs to do their business in a designated area - nap and snack time are also part of the doggy day care day.
DogTown
WHEN|WHERE 7 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturdays, 40385 County Rte. 48, Southold
INFO 631-765-8844, dogtownny.com

Abstract: Ellen Goldberg Bellmore - Our roads and highways are in appalling shape, and I'm not talking about potholes.

Full text:   Saw something, said something, but . . .
During a recent Friday rush hour, there were two bags with airline tags on them sitting by the entrance to the 1, 2 and 3 subway trains at Penn Station. There was no one near the bags.
I called 911 and was told to hold on. I hung up and called again; same response.
Suddenly, some guy shows up and grabs the bags. I tear into him, and he is completely oblivious to why I'm angry. Meanwhile, there are still no police in sight.
"If you see something, say something" is broken.

Local roads in
sorry shape
I've lived in Bellmore since 1974. In that time, my street has fallen into disrepair. It's full of potholes and equipment left behind by those performing services on or near our street. It looks and feels like I am living in a slum area. Still, my taxes continue to increase.
In addition, the canal on my corner - Shore Road and Army Place - continually floods, and there are patches where the flooding has caused holes.
I want to know when this street will be repaired.
Ellen Goldberg
Bellmore
-
Our roads and highways are in appalling shape, and I'm not talking about potholes. A recent walk along an overpass crossing the Southern State Parkway in Wantagh had me thinking I was taking a stroll through a garbage dump.
Cement pieces, buckets, strollers, plastic, diapers and bottles littered the way.

LI stores, developers on how retail is evolving

Author: Al-Muslim, Aisha; McDermott, Maura; Ocasio, Victor

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 May 2016. [Duplicate]

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788529972?accountid=37869

Abstract: "Many retailers have said that in markets where they have pulled out of their brick and mortar stores to focus solely online, that they have seen a dramatic drop from purchases," Joshua Weinkranz, president of the Northeast region of Kimco Realty Corp., a New Hyde Park-based real estate investment trust, said.

Full text:   Shopping centers and malls on Long Island and in the nation are evolving as stores get smaller, landlords add non-retail tenants such as medical clinics and gyms, and retailers move into mixed-use developments where residents live.
Behind the evolution are challenges that are forcing retailers and developers to adapt. Nationally, there's the rise of online shopping, and retailers are shrinking store footprints since the recession that ended in 2009. On Long Island, additional challenges include expensive real estate, long development lead times, and high utility and tax costs.
But the payoff that keeps attracting retailers to the Island is the region's high spending. The buying power is driven by the Island's median household income, which was $98,401 in Nassau County and $88,323 in Suffolk County in 2014 - nearly double the national figure of $53,482, according to the most recent census estimates.
"We have malls that are serving an affluent and highly dense population, so that's why some of them have exceptionally high retail numbers," said Marshal Cohen, retail analyst with The NPD Group, a Port Washington-based market research company.
While there are challenges here such as delays getting approvals, "if you can sort through that, the rewards of Long Island are also very fruitful," said Todd Magazine, a Port Washington native and president of Blink Fitness, which has opened eight locations on Long Island since 2012.
Using online and in-store selling
The Internet is eroding the "cash-and-carry mentality" that once drew hordes of shoppers into stores, Cohen said. Already, 24 percent of electronics and nearly 20 percent of toys and office supplies are purchased online - and that share is expected to grow to 40 percent within five years, he said.
To survive, retailers are combining their offline and online businesses. They are bulking up their websites and mobile apps, Cohen said.
"Many retailers have said that in markets where they have pulled out of their brick and mortar stores to focus solely online, that they have seen a dramatic drop from purchases," Joshua Weinkranz, president of the Northeast region of Kimco Realty Corp., a New Hyde Park-based real estate investment trust, said. He was speaking at a retail panel discussion in Melville on Thursday hosted by the Commercial Industrial Brokers Society of Long Island and The Retail Network. "A lot of retailers have realized that they need both," he said.
Although more than 90 percent of Target's sales happen in-store, company spokeswoman Kristy Welker said, Target also uses stores as local distribution centers. Website and app orders shipped to and from stores account for more than 30 percent of its digital sales.
"Stores play a critical role in on-demand shopping," Welker said.
Many consumers still want to "see, feel and touch" appliances and electronics before buying them, said Gregg Richard, chief executive of Farmingdale-based appliance and electronics retailer P.C. Richard & Son.
However, the chain is continually updating its website to make it easier for consumers to compare items and make purchases, Richard said.
"Customers want things quicker and easier, so we do try to stay ahead of that," he said.
Smaller stores
Large retailers such as Target, Walmart and Macy's are experimenting with smaller stores - in part because many customers prefer them for everyday shopping.
Target plans to open two new, smaller format stores, in Freeport and Elmont, in October. The locations, a 46,000-square-foot store at the Meadowbrook Commons shopping center and a 24,500-square-foot space at an Elmont shopping center near Belmont Park, will have a smaller merchandise selection than the chain's full-size stores, which are usually around 140,000 square feet.
Last summer, Macy's opened off-price stores called Macy's Backstage in the Lake Success Shopping Center in New Hyde Park and at the Melville Mall in Huntington. Macy's Backstage stores, which are a fifth of the size of a regular Macy's store, offer off-price, discount, clearance and full-price items.
For Lisa King, of Old Bethpage, who was shopping Friday at Macy's Backstage at the Melville Mall, the smaller stores are more convenient than sprawling department stores.
"It's not overwhelming," said the 45-year-old substitute teacher. "Don't give me the mall."
Mixed uses
Retailers, food establishments and other businesses are also opening in mixed-use developments, which combine retail, office space and apartments.
"The future of Long Island as far as retail goes is the mixed-use projects that we see throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties," Robert E. Sandler, a commercial real estate attorney and partner in the Farrell Fritz law firm in Uniondale, said at the retail panel Thursday in front of a crowd of about 75 people.
About 60 percent of the retail space has been leased in Wyandanch Village, a complex that is being built near the community's rail station and is part of the $500 million Wyandanch Rising downtown revitalization project. Tenants include New York Community Bank, Domino's, Anthony's Pizza, Cricket Wireless, and K & B department store, said Jayson Siano, managing principal of Garden City-based Sabre Real Estate Group, the retail leasing agent.
"The retailers and businesses have a built-in audience if they are in the base of a project," Siano said.
Non-retail tenants
As retailers seek smaller spaces, malls and shopping centers have been renting to non-retail businesses such as urgent-care facilities, gyms, fast-casual restaurants and salons, to diversify the tenant mix and increase foot traffic.
"We realized that as the shopping center industry grew we had to find other ways of bringing shoppers to our center," said Steve Appas, part owner and director of real estate for Lighthouse Realty Partners, a Valley Stream-based developer and property management firm.
Diversification can benefit everyone.
Retro Fitness has opened 15 locations on Long Island since 2009 and recently signed a lease in Oceanside.
"Most people go to a gym two or three times a week so that's bringing additional people in" to shopping areas, said Rebecca Foth, vice president of real estate for Colts Neck, New Jersey-based Retro. Busy retailers, she said, "all can kind of feed off each other."
That's even true for medical facilities such as GoHealth Urgent Care, a chain of clinics operated by Great Neck-based Northwell Health. The chain operates 23 clinics in the metropolitan area, including 11 on Long Island.
"We like to locate ourselves where people live their everyday lives," said Adam Boll, who oversees ambulatory services at Northwell. Opening clinics in shopping centers, he said, "where it's easy for patients to be able to access us and not go out of their way, is a major priority for us."
Nationwide, malls and shopping center landlords are also incorporating movie theaters, bowling alleys, destination eateries, even common areas with benches and fire pits.
Retailers and the developers want a more "entertainment-oriented experience," said Brad Blumenfeld, vice president of Syosset-based Blumenfeld Development Group, a commercial developer of office and retail projects. "Even retail is becoming more experiential."
LI's development delays
Communities have gotten stricter about approving large retail locations in the last decade, leading to long delays.
"To get a new mall approved on Long Island - I think man is going to be living on Mars before then," Cohen said.
Municipal permitting rules tend to go without updates for years, which can lead to differing interpretations of how regulations apply to proposed projects, said Rob Loscalzo, chief operating officer of developer Tritec Real Estate Co. in East Setauket.
"In some cases it can delay your project for months or years," said Loscalzo, who oversees the leasing of retail space at Tritec's mixed-used New Village development in Patchogue.
New Village faced opposition from residents and neighboring businesses. Patchogue Mayor Paul Pontieri, who worked with Tritec to bring the $110 million, 291-unit project to the village's downtown, said it was possible to get approval because he has a longer term as mayor than most municipal officials.
"Most of your town supervisors and some of the other mayors are on for two-year terms," said Pontieri, who holds a four-year term. "With a two-year term, you can't even get a site plan approved or looked at by a planning board."
A couple of years ago, Walmart wanted to expand its grocery-focused Neighborhood Market - it opened one in Levittown in 2013 - to more than a dozen stores on Long Island. The stores are typically one-third the size of its regular stores. But the company gave up its bid because the approval process was too complicated, said Joseph A. Deal, principal of Hauppauge-based Bohler Engineering's New York metro region. Instead, the retailer went south, and his North Carolina office helped Walmart open 70 stores in the region about two years, he said at the retail panel.
Walmart declined to respond to Deal's assertions.
Persistence can, however, pay off. For more than a decade Neiman Marcus tried to open a store on the Island, including an ill-fated bid to be the anchor tenant at the 39-acre former Cerro Wire property in Syosset. The luxury retailer finally opened a store in February at Roosevelt Field mall.
"Everywhere we open a new store, we have a new set of challenges," Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Ginger Reeder said. "Luckily, our store planning team has many years of experience and has yet to find a challenge we could not handle." With Ken Schachter

WYANDANCH
LIRR cuts ribbon
on parking garage
The president of the Long Island Rail Road yesterday joined elected officials for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the LIRR's new five-story parking garage near Wyandanch station.
LIRR president Patrick Nowakowski said the "state of the art" structure features 920 spaces, a towering glass-painted art installation and several security features, including cameras. "It's a great facility," Nowakowski said.
The parking garage is scheduled to formally open Sept. 1 with prices ranging from $3 for up to six hours to $70 for a monthly parking permit. However, the garage is already in use and all fees are waived through the end of August.
The garage is the railroad's contribution to the Wyandanch Rising transit-oriented development underway in the community. The LIRR funded the $29 million structure through federal funds and through the MTA's 2010-2014 capital program.
"This structure is more than just a place to park cars," Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said at the ceremony. "This structure is the physical manifestation of a powerful partnership developed over time between a local community striving to better its circumstances and the largest commuter railroad in the country."

MANORVILLE
Town buys farmland to hold as open space
Brookhaven Town officials have acquired 40 acres of land in Manorville for the town's open space program.
About 40 percent of the property, at the southwest corner of Wading River Road and a Long Island Expressway service road, is farmland that will be leased to a local farmer, Councilman Dan Panico said.
The remaining 60 percent of the property is a wooded area that will be preserved as open space, he said.
The land was donated to the town by Islandia-based developer Heatherwood Communities in exchange for the town board's approval last year of Heatherwood's plan to build 200 senior housing condominium units in South Setauket.
The town board voted 4-3 in December to approve the condominium plan and acquisition of the Manorville land.
Panico said the Manorville property is a "key piece of the Manorville farm belt." He estimated the market value of the land would be about $4 million.
"It's in the best interest of the Town of Brookhaven and all of Long Island to preserve farmland and keep farmers farming," Panico said.

SYOSSET
Residents in mobile park face eviction
Residents of the Syosset Mobile Home Park on West Jericho Turnpike face eviction as soon as today after years in court.
Residents have fought owner STP Associates LLC, a Melville-based company that bought the premises in 2007. Nassau County District Court Judge Douglas Lerose on July 2 ruled that the court would issue eviction warrants no sooner than Aug. 14.

EAST ISLIP
Group to host its last flood claim meeting
A New Jersey nonprofit, along with disaster recovery experts, will host the last of a series of town-hall-style meetings tomorrow to help homeowners with answers on disputes for federal flood damage claims stemming from superstorm Sandy.
Residents will hear from experts from Weisbrod, Matteis & Copley PLLC, a Washington, D.C.-based law firm and George Kasimos, founder of the Toms River, New Jersey-based Stop FEMA Now, and be able to ask questions about the Sept. 15 deadline to reopen their flood insurance claims, said Michael Caputo, spokesman for the law firm.
On FEMA's website, the agency wrote there were "allegations that some policyholders were underpaid for their Hurricane Sandy claims" and "FEMA wants to make sure policyholders who filed Sandy claims are paid what they are owed under their policy."
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has "invited 144,000 people who live along the shoreline there to reopen their claim," Caputo said. "To date, only about 10,000 have done it, and there's only 30 days left. This is an opportunity for homeowners who filed flood claims, who believe they were underpaid, to ask questions."
Several similar meetings have been held on Long Island, including in Merrick, Freeport, Oceanside, Long Beach, Babylon, Massapequa and Seaford, according to Caputo.
"Even though you are completely fed up with the process and fed up with Hurricane Sandy, there's something you can do to get the money you deserve," Caputo said. "If you filed a claim and you have flood insurance and you have a feeling you didn't get what you deserve, you are probably absolutely correct."
The meeting will be held from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. at the American Legion Four S Post 1635 (3 Bayview Ave., East Islip). Those who wish to opt-in to the insurance-claims review process can visit fema.gov/hurricane-sandy-nfip-claims or call 866-337-4262.

Babylon
Village, schools agree to share services
Mayor Ralph Scordino and Babylon school district Superintendent Linda Rozzi have announced a September-to-June agreement for garbage pickup and after-hours security at district buildings.
The district will pay the village $38,500 but save about $55,000 under the deal, which Scordino said was a first for both sides. "This is new territory," he said. "We were prompted by the governor's office to show that different governing agencies within the town or the villages could be sharing services."
Village code enforcement and sanitation workers will do the work, and the pay will go toward a new code enforcement vehicle, Scordino said.
"The Babylon UFSD [Union Free School District] and Babylon Village together have taken such progressive steps in exploring such efficiencies that keep our taxpayers in mind," Rozzi said in a statement.
It's not the first time the two sides have cooperated. District students use the village tennis courts, and the district's auditorium is used for the village's summer concerts in case of rain.

NORTH HEMPSTEAD
Board does not vote on garage sale plan
The town board did not vote on a proposal for garage sale restrictions at a public hearing Tuesday, saying the proposed law first needs approval before the Nassau County Planning Commission.
The proposed bill limits residents to holding garage sales to four times a year after complaints that residents were holding them too frequently and essentially as businesses.
Nassau's other two towns, Hempstead and Oyster Bay, do not regulate garage sales.
Some residents cheered the proposal at Tuesday night's town board meeting. Town officials said the issue has riled residents in several parts of the town, particularly North New Hyde Park and Roslyn.
Town Attorney Elizabeth Botwin said the maximum penalty can be up to 15 days in jail, but the town would probably use its authority to plea-bargain the cases.
The next town board meeting is at 7:30 p.m. Aug. 25 in Town Hall in Manhasset.

Town Dems donate
$4G to Independents
The North Hempstead Democratic Committee has contributed $4,000 to the Independence Party Club of Nassau, amid a feud between the minor party and Nassau Democratic chairman Jay Jacobs.
The donation was the largest single contribution received by the Independence Party Club of Nassau between Jan. 12 and July 12, according to July filings with the state Board of Elections. It was also the largest single contribution by the North Hempstead Democratic Committee in that period.
Jacobs in the past has criticized the Nassau Independence Party, saying its financial disclosures indicate that much of the funding goes directly to party leaders, including chairman Rick Bellando.
Bellando is catering manager for Oheka Castle, the historic Huntington catering hall owned by developer Gary Melius. Melius has told Newsday in the past he plays no role in Nassau political decisions.
Jacobs said in an interview that he was "surprised to see" the contribution to the Independence Party.
"I think it's just a waste of money," Jacobs said of the North Hempstead Democrats' contribution. "But that's their decision."
North Hempstead Democratic leader Gerard Terry said he had "no comment" about the donation. North Hempstead Supervisor Judi Bosworth, a Democrat who is seeking re-election in November, declined to comment.
Bellando and an attorney for Melius did not return calls and messages for comment.
"It's a lot of money," Jacobs said. "I'm sure Gerard Terry is a smart, political professional, and I believe that he knows what he's doing and he must have seen value in it; what that is, I don't know."

GLEN COVE
Mayor sets debate; challenger declines
Mayor Reginald Spinello has set Sept. 3 as the date for a primary-election debate with challenger Anthony Gallo - but Gallo, a city councilman, says he won't be there.
On July 28, Spinello proposed a debate, but Gallo said he would accept only if it is held after the Sept. 10 primary. The two candidates will face each other in the Republican primary, but Spinello is an Independence Party member, and Gallo said a primary debate should be between members of the same party. He said he would agree to debate before the primary if Spinello switches his registration to the GOP, something the mayor has so far not indicated he would do.
In the latest email Spinello sent to Gallo, on Aug. 7, the mayor reminded Gallo that the Republican Party endorsed him for re-election. Spinello also is backed by the Independence, Democratic and Conservative parties.
Spinello invited Gallo to debate at 7 p.m. Sept. 3 at the Glen Cove Mansion. The mayor said he would arrange for a neutral moderator, who would work with the two candidates on a format. Spinello said he would appear even if Gallo doesn't.
In a statement titled "Gallo Looking Forward to Mayoral Monologue," Gallo on Saturday wrote that "it's not clear whether his solo performance would take the form of a one-man Independence Party forum or a simple news conference, but I wish the mayor all the best with his show."
Gallo said that Spinello "dictates that I pretend he is a Republican. My answer to that decree is no."

AQUEBOGUE
Paumanok wins
'Winery of the Year'
Paumanok Vineyards of Aquebogue won the "Winery of the Year" award on Monday at the 2015 New York Wine & Food Classic.
Paumanok also won a "best of class" honor for its 2014 semi-dry riesling.
"We're very happy," said Charles Massoud, who established the winery with his wife, Ursula. They started growing grapes on a former potato farm in 1983. Massoud added, "It's a team effort." The Massouds' sons, Kareem, Salim and Nabeel, run the day-to-day operations. Kareem is the winemaker. "Our three sons are really passionate about what they're doing ... this is great for our sons. They're doing all the work."
Two Paumanok wines, the 2010 Assemblage red blend and the 2005 cabernet sauvignon Tuthills Lane Vineyard, were named among the top 12 wines produced on Long Island in Newsday in 2013.
McCall Wines in Cutchogue received the award for best oaked chardonnay; Osprey's Dominion in Peconic won for best cabernet sauvignon; Martha Clara Vineyards in Riverhead for best pinot noir and sauvignon blanc; Harbes Vineyard of Mattituck for best merlot; and Sparkling Pointe in Southold for best vinifera sparking white.
This is the second time Paumanok has won winery-of-the-year honors. Last year, Martha Clara won it; in 2013, McCall did.
Judges tasted more than 850 New York State wines. The Governor's Cup, the competition's biggest prize, was awarded to Ventosa Vineyards in Geneva. The event was held upstate in Canandaigua.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Sunday that new deaths from the coronavirus are possibly reaching a plateau in New York state, even as local officials say the toll on Long Island continues to climb.
As of Sunday, Cuomo said, there have been 122,031 coronavirus cases and 4,149 deaths related to the disease. Suffolk County reported 51 new deaths - the most since the pandemic started - bringing its total to 175. Nassau County on Sunday afternoon reported 13 new deaths, bringing the total of virus-related deaths to 162.
Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said that despite the surge in deaths, fewer people were going into the hospital the last two days than were prior. More of those hospitalized are moving into ICU, he said.
Bellone, noting that 107 patients had been discharged from the hospital, said that number "is good news...we are seeing more people discharged every day."
President Donald Trump said in his Sunday evening news briefing that the federal government is sending 200,000 n95 masks to Suffolk County, "where they need it really badly."
"Long Island now has become a hot spot, part of New York. We're sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, " said Trump, who said Shirley Republican Lee Zeldin had made the request.
He said the federal government will deliver 600,000 N95 masks to New York City Monday.
Trump said there were glimmers of hope and progress being made in  multiple states, including New York, just hours after his surgeon general said this week will be akin to Pearl Harbor and 9/11. 
"Today every patriotic American's heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey. They have really become a hot zone but some very good things are happening," he said. "In New York, for the first time  where the deaths were less from the previous day. That's the first drop so far so that could be a good sign." 
Trump also said it's possible the military medical ship U.S. Comfort could be used for coronavirus patients. " The ship is ready and if it has to, if we need it, if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that," he said.
The hospital ship had been sent to New York City to deal with non-virus cases but Trump said they may change since the ship has been handling such a low volume of patients.
Earlier Sunday, Cuomo sounded a note of cautious optimism at signs that the state's level of confirmed cases could be approaching or even be past its peak. The past 24 hours saw 594 deaths, a decrease from the record 630 reported Friday. About 12,000 people in New York have been discharged from hospital care - 74% of all cases - with 1,700 discharged in one day, the governor said.
"We could be very nearly near the apex and we could be beyond the plateau right now," Cuomo said in his daily update on the pandemic Sunday morning. "The coronavirus is truly a vicious and effective killer at what the virus does ... We are all watching a movie and we are waiting to see what the next scene is."
He said that as the number of cases have surged in Nassau and Suffolk counties, fewer new cases are being reported in New York City.
There were additionally 1,052 new cases in Nassau, bringing the total to 14,398.
In Suffolk, Bellone said there were 12,405 confirmed cases, an increase of 1,035 from Saturday.
 In New York City, there were 64,955 cases as of Sunday evening, with 14,205 hospitalized and 2,472 dead, officials said. 
Cuomo again reiterated Sunday that more assistance in the form of medical personnel and supplies is needed.
"People of Nassau can't handle it alone," the governor said.
The federal government on Sunday deployed 325 personnel, including doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians and therapists, to help the New York City hospital system, Cuomo said. The federal government will deploy approximately 1,000 personnel in total to the state to assist with the virus.
Cuomo said New York is continuing to operate on a "surge and flex" system, where the state is working to share resources, including the additional federal personnel, at the most stressed hospitals.
He said the state has not yet acquired any upstate ventilators for use at downstate hospitals but said it could become necessary. The executive order last week had caused a backlash from some upstate lawmakers, who opposed redistributing the ventilators that help COVID-19 patients breathe.
Bellone, in his news conference on Sunday, asked lawmakers to clarify their letter to the governor asking for the ventilators to stay upstate and saying they would be needed. Keeping unused ventilators upstate "would be inhumane," he said.
"The epicenter of this fight is on Long Island and downstate," he said. "When upstate needs it, we will be there to support them."
On Saturday, Cuomo described the growing number of COVID-19 hospitalizations on Long Island as "like a fire spreading." Nassau also gained the grim distinction Saturday as the county with the most cases nationwide outside the five boroughs of New York City.
In the past two weeks, the percentage of state coronavirus hospitalizations on Long Island rose to 22% from 15%, as the proportion from New York City declined, the governor said Saturday. 
Nassau County reported Sunday afternoon that of the 13 new deaths, 10 were men and 3 were women. Their ages ranged from 62 to 93. There have now been 162 COVID-19 related deaths.
Suffolk County stopped reporting details on the deaths, such as ages of patients or communities where are from, citing a lack of time.
 As of Sunday, officials began relying on state health department death figures to reduce the reporting burdens on front-line workers.
"For me the most important thing is for those front-line workers to be focused on their missions, and that is to save lives," Bellone said.
The 51 deaths reported Sunday exceeded the previous record day, of 28, which was reported on Saturday.
Peconic Landing, a Greenport retirement community, reported a ninth death of a resident there. The 98-year-old woman at the skilled nursing unit had tested positive on March 19 and died Saturday. She had known preexisting conditions.
Also Sunday, a Northwell Health spokesman said the system has seen a leveling in the number of COVID-19 patients at its hospitals.
"We were at about 3,100 patients on Friday, so it's slowed a little," spokesman Terry Lynam said. "We had been going up by about 300 per day."
Lynam said Northwell hospitals are close to 90% capacity, although Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Long Island Jewish Forest Hills and Mather Hospital in Port Jefferson are at capacity. Mather has received patients from areas that have experienced an overflow of COVID-19 patients.
Queens and western Nassau have remained hot spots, although "this is everywhere," Lyman said.
The New Hyde Park-based hospital system on Friday released guidelines for rationing ventilators to "patients most likely to benefit," according to a Politico story.
But Northwell Health Chief Executive Officer Michael Dowling, speaking Sunday on CBS' "Face The Nation," said the system had not yet reached the point where rationing is needed.
"The policy that you referenced is a draft policy," Dowling told host Margaret Brennan. "It is something that we like to prepare for the inevitability. In case that we ever have to do something in the future, you have to have a policy prepared well in advance."
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also speaking on "Face the Nation," warned that new cases will escalate across the country this week with the national apex remaining eight to nine days away. Still, when new cases begin to stabilize, as they are in New York City, he said "that's the first sign of that plateau and coming down."
"So just buckle down, continue to mitigate, continue to do the physical separation," he said. "Because we got to get through this week that's coming up ... it is going to be a bad week."
As local communities coped with the pandemic, fire departments across Long Island sounded their sirens Sunday night in honor of health care providers and others who are on the front lines caring for those impacted by the coronavirus.
"This is a thank you to the health care providers," said Bruce Smith, former chief of the Huntington Fire Department and a volunteer with the Huntington Manor Fire Department. "We want them to know we are here and we are thinking about them."
Smith said he learned of the effort through fire departments in the Town of Babylon and then he brought the idea to Huntington.
Several other departments, such as Commack and East Farmingdale Volunteer Fire Company, posted the event on social media and asked residents to join in and make some noise to show support.
Huntington residents cheered and banged pots and pans at 7 p.m. as the sirens wailed in the background.
The Oceanside, Long Beach, Island Park, Freeport and other fire departments and first responders were planning to do a drive by Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital at 6:30 p.m. Sunday to show support for staff and patients.
Earlier Sunday, Bellone said that fire departments as well as other emergency service agencies will sound the sirens as a tribute.
"They are acknowledging the incredible work and sacrifices by our health care workers and this is a wonderful thing," Bellone said, who added that the county's H. Lee Dennison Building in Hauppauge will be lit in blue honoring the health care workers Sunday night and going forward.
 Monday, New York City police officers will turn out at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx to show appreciation for workers there who are on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. With applause and lights flashing on their police vehicles, officers will be delivering food and refreshments for the hospital's nurses, doctors and support staff.
Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer called again for the Trump administration to appoint a senior military official as a national coronavirus czar to oversee the production and distribution of ventilators, personal protective equipment and other supplies needed to combat the pandemic.
State and local authorities are now competing against each other for vital equipment and the nation needs a strong leader with sweeping powers, Schumer said Sunday during a news conference in Brooklyn. The nation's supply-and-distribution chain, he said, has failed at delivering resources where they are most urgently needed.
"We have a 'Wild West' situation across the land really where state, local officials, hospital executives and others are forced to go on individual scavenger hunts for vitally needed materials and personnel," the Senate Minority Leader said outside his Park Slope home as ambulance sirens screamed in the background. 
Trump expressed hostility to the idea Thursday on Twitter. 
"Somebody please explain to Cryin' Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral, in fact," the president tweeted, referring to Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, who is leading the FEMA supply chain task force. 
Also Sunday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said last weekend that the city had just enough ventilators and other medical supplies to last until as early as Sunday. He said the city has survived that emergency but it is still in trouble. 
"The good news is our call was heard and acted on in so many ways but that does not mean we are out of the woods for next week." 
He said the city can get through Tuesday or Wednesday with the supplies on hand. 
 Asked about Cuomo's statements about the apex, de Blasio said there are some hopeful indicators but it is too early to say.
"I'm going to be really careful because the last thing I want to do is say we are turning a corner and then we get surprised. I see some positive indicators. Clearly, the fact that we thought we could run out of ventilators as early as tonight or tomorrow morning and now we believe we are going to get to Tuesday or Wednesday, that is a good sign."
Meanwhile, on Long Island, officials continued to stress the need for social distancing.
Police were called to a West Broadway address in Woodmere about 11:30 a.m. Saturday following reports of an overcrowded religious service. The Nassau County Fire Marshal's Office found multiple fire code violations due to the crowd as well as three propane-powered cooking surfaces in a nearby parking lot, said a department spokesman, Assistant Chief Fire Marshal Michael Uttaro.
Houses of worship are not ordered closed under Cuomo's New York State on PAUSE executive order, but it is strongly recommended no congregate services be held and social distance be maintained. Woodmere has emerged as one of Long Island's ho

The United States has now recorded 100,000 deaths due to the coronavirus.
It’s a moment to collectively grieve and reflect.
Even as we mourn for those we knew, cry for those we loved and consider also those who have died uncounted, I hope that we can also resolve to learn more, test better, hold our leaders accountable and better protect our citizens so we do not have to reach another grim milestone.
Help Us Report on Coronavirus
Are you a public health worker, medical provider, elected official, patient or other COVID-19 expert? Help make sure our journalism is responsible and focused on the right issues.
Note: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.
Through public records requests and other reporting, ProPublica has found example after example of delays, mistakes and missed opportunities. The CDC took weeks to fix its faulty test. In Seattle, 33,000 fans attended a soccer match, even after the top local health official said he wanted to end mass gatherings. Houston went ahead with a livestock show and rodeo that typically draws 2.5 million people, until evidence of community spread shut it down after eight days. Nebraska kept a meatpacking plant open that health officials wanted to shut down, and cases from the plant subsequently skyrocketed. And in New York, the epicenter of the pandemic, political infighting between Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio hampered communication and slowed decision making at a time when speed was critical to stop the virus’ exponential spread.
COVID-19 has also laid bare many long-standing inequities and failings in America’s health care system. It is devastating, but not surprising, to learn that many of those who have been most harmed by the virus are also Americans who have long suffered from historical social injustices that left them particularly susceptible to the disease.
This massive loss of life wasn’t inevitable. It wasn’t simply unfortunate and regrettable. Even without a vaccine or cure, better mitigation measures could have prevented infections from happening in the first place; more testing capacity could have allowed patients to be identified and treated earlier.
The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, far from it.

At this moment, the questions we need to ask are: How do we prevent the next 100,000 deaths from happening? How do we better protect our most vulnerable in the coming months? Even while we mourn, how can we take action, so we do not repeat this horror all over again?
Here’s what we’ve learned so far.
Though we’ve long known about infection control problems in nursing homes, COVID-19 got in and ran roughshod.

From the first weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, when the virus tore through the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, nursing homes and long-term care facilities have emerged as one of the deadliest settings. As of May 21, there have been around 35,000 deaths of staff and residents in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.
Yet the facilities have continued to struggle with basic infection control. Federal inspectors have found homes with insufficient staff and a lack of personal protective equipment. Others have failed to maintain social distancing among residents, according to inspection reports ProPublica reviewed. Desperate family members have had to become detectives and activists, one even going as far as staging a midnight rescue of her loved one as the virus spread through a Queens, New York, assisted living facility.
What now? The risk to the elderly will not decrease as time goes by — more than any other population, they will need the highest levels of protection until the pandemic is over. The CEO of the industry’s trade group told my colleague Charles Ornstein: “Just like hospitals, we have called for help. In our case, nobody has listened.” More can be done to protect our nursing home and long term care population. This means regular testing of both staff and residents, adequate protective gear and a realistic way to isolate residents who test positive.
Racial disparities in health care are pervasive in medicine, as they have been in COVID-19 deaths.

African Americans have contracted and died of the coronavirus at higher rates across the country. This is due to myriad factors, including more limited access to medical care as well as environmental, economic and political factors that put them at higher risk of chronic conditions. When ProPublica examined the first 100 recorded victims of the coronavirus in Chicago, we found that 70 were black. African Americans make up 30% of the city’s population.
What now? States should make sure that safety-net hospitals, which serve a large portion of low-income and uninsured patients regardless of their ability to pay, and hospitals in neighborhoods that serve predominantly black communities, are well-supplied and sufficiently staffed during the crisis. More can also be done to encourage African American patients to not delay seeking care, even when they have “innocent symptoms” like a cough or low-grade fever, especially when they suffer other health conditions like diabetes.
Racial disparities go beyond medicine, to other aspects of the pandemic. Data shows that black people are already being disproportionately arrested for social distancing violations, a measure that can undercut public health efforts and further raise the risk of infection, especially when enforcement includes time in a crowded jail.
Essential workers had little choice but to work during COVID-19, but adequate safeguards weren’t put in place to protect them.

We’ve known from the beginning there are some measures that help protect us from the virus, such as physical distancing. Yet millions of Americans haven’t been able to heed that advice, and have had no choice but to risk their health daily as they’ve gone to work shoulder-to-shoulder in meat-packing plants, rung up groceries while being forbidden to wear gloves, or delivered the mail. Those who are undocumented live with the additional fear of being caught by immigration authorities if they go to a hospital for testing or treatment.
What now? Research has shown that there’s a much higher risk of transmission in enclosed spaces than outdoors, so providing good ventilation, adequate physical distancing, and protective gear as appropriate for workers in indoor spaces is critical for safety. We also now know that patients are likely most infectious right before or at the time when symptoms start appearing, so if workplaces are generous about their sick leave policies, workers can err on the side of caution if they do feel unwell, and not have to choose between their livelihoods and their health. It’s also important to have adequate testing capacity, so infections can be caught before they turn into a large outbreak.
Frontline health care workers were not given adequate PPE and were sometimes fired for speaking up about it.

While health workers have not, thankfully, been dying at conspicuously higher rates, they continue to be susceptible to the virus due to their work. The national scramble for ventilators and personal protective equipment has exposed the just-in-time nature of hospitals’ inventories: Nurses across the country have had to work with expired N95 masks, or no masks at all. Health workers have been suspended, or put on unpaid leave, because they didn’t see eye to eye with their administrators on the amount of protective gear they needed to keep themselves safe while caring for patients.
First responders — EMTs, firefighters and paramedics — are often forgotten when it comes to funding, even though they are the first point of contact with sick patients. The lack of a coherent system nationwide meant that some first responders felt prepared, while others were begging for masks at local hospitals.
What now? As states reopen, it will be important to closely track hospital capacity, and if cases rise and threaten their medical systems’ ability to care for patients, governments will need to be ready to pause or even dial back reopening measures. It should go without saying that adequate protective gear is a must. I also hope that hospital administrators are thinking about mental health care for their staffs. Doctors and nurses have told us of the immense strain of caring for patients whom they don’t know how to save, while also worrying about getting sick themselves, or carrying the virus home to their loved ones. Even “heroes” need supplies and support.

There continue to be questions on which data is lacking, such as the effects of the coronavirus on pregnant women. Without evidence-based research, pregnant women have been left to make decisions on their own, sometimes trying to limit their exposure against their employer’s wishes.
Similarly, there’s a paucity of data on children’s risk level and their role in transmission. While we can confidently say that it’s rare for children to get very ill if they do get infected, there’s not as much information on whether children are as infectious as adults. Answering that question would not just help parents make decisions (Can I let my kid go to day care when we live with Grandma?) but also help officials make evidence-based decisions on how and when to reopen schools.
There’s some research I don’t want to rush. Experts say the bar for evidence should be extremely high when it comes to a vaccine’s safety and benefit. It makes sense that we might be willing to use a therapeutic with less evidence on critically ill patients, knowing that without any intervention, they would soon die. A vaccine, however, is intended to be given to vast numbers of healthy people. So yes, we have to move urgently, but we must still take the time to gather robust data.
Our nation’s leaders have many choices to make in the coming weeks and months. I hope they will heed the advice of scientists, doctors and public health officials, and prioritize the protection of everyone from essential workers to people in prisons and homeless shelters who does not have the privilege of staying home for the duration of the pandemic.
The coronavirus is a wily adversary. We may ultimately defeat it with a vaccine or effective therapeutics. But what we’ve learned from the first 100,000 deaths is that we can save lives with the oldest mitigation tactics in the public health arsenal — and that being slow to act comes with a terrible cost.
I refuse to succumb to fatalism, to just accepting the ever higher death toll as inevitable. I want us to make it harder for this virus to take each precious life from us. And I believe we can.

Full text: Corruption trials have their day in court
Corruption trials on Long Island had their day in court in 2019, with former officials of both parties facing guilty verdicts. The region spent the early part of the year grappling with the loss of a potential Amazon headquarters nearby. The Island picked up $87.9 million for economic development. And officials helped small businesses navigate a moratorium on gas service from National Grid, until it was lifted.
Here’s a look at some of the year’s top stories.
 
Long Island scores $87.9M for economic development
Long Island is receiving $87.9 million in economic and community development funding, state officials said in December. The money was awarded through Round IX of the Regional Economic Development Council initiative.
The funding was part of more than $761 million awarded to districts across the state. It is directed at job creation, workforce training, tourism, a growth of high-tech industries and more.
This year, Long Island was deemed a “top performer” in the state.
“Throughout the Regional Economic Development Council process over the past nine years, we have seen unprecedented regional investment focusing on a ground-up, strategic model that has spurred tremendous growth in every corner of this great state,”Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement.
“By bringing together local leaders and stakeholders who are invested in their communities we have replaced the ‘one size fits all’ approach to economic development with one that is unique to each community, creating opportunities for success all across the Empire State,” he added.
Kevin Law, the president and CEO of the Long Island Association, and Stuart Rabinowitz, the president of Hofstra University, lead the council on Long Island.
Projects that received funding include the Port Washington Film and TV Productions studios, to convert a vacant building into a six-stage TV and movie production facility.
Also receiving funding is Biocogent, a Stony Brook University incubator company, to add jobs and expand its manufacturing capacity beyond its incubator.
Funding went to Farmingdale State College to construct a new collaborative STEM building. Other awardees include Long Island MacArthur Airport to modernize its main terminal, as well as the Town of Riverhead for a downtown revitalization program for its riverfront.
 
Spota, McPartland found guilty on all counts
A jury has convicted former Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota and one of his former chief aides Christopher McPartland at the federal courthouse in Central Islip on Dec. 17.
The trial surrounded the cover-up of aformer protege, James Burke, who, as police chief, assaulted a handcuffed man in 2012 who was suspected of stealing embarrassing items from his police department SUV, including sex toys and pornography.
Both defendants were found guilty on all counts, according to the U.S. Justice Department. They each face up to 20 years in prison.
The verdict came after a five-week trial that shined a light on corruption at the highest levels of law enforcement in Suffolk County.
According to federal prosecutors, Spota, McPartland, Burke and other police officers met and spoke by phone to discuss how to conceal Burke’s role in the assault on the victim, Christopher Loeb. In addition to pressuring people not to cooperate, they asked witnesses to provide investigators with false information and withhold relevant information from investigators, federal prosecutors said.
“When a sitting district attorney and the chief of the Government Corruption Bureau attempt to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation, it is nothing short of an attack onthe justice system itself, and it will not be tolerated by the Justice Department,” Richard Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of NewYork, said in a statement.
 
Venditto pleads guilty, won’t serve jail time
The former town supervisor of Oyster Bay, John Venditto, pleaded guilty in July to official misconduct and corrupt use of position of authority in Nassau County Court, officials said.
He was sentenced to a conditional discharge, according to Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas.
“Our investigation uncovered pervasive corruption in the Town of Oyster Bay where the powerful and connected used the government to benefit themselves at the expense of the taxpayers they were sworn to serve,” Singas said in a statement.
Singas said the felony plea “sends a strong message that corruption will not be tolerated in Nassau County.”
Venditto was accused of conspiring with former town Planning and Development Commissioner Frederick Ippolito to accept bribes from a town contractor. The conspiracy, prosecutors said, was all part of a scheme to gain approval to rezone Cantiague Commons, a Hicksville property long slated for development.
An attorney for Venditto, Marc Agnifilo, told Newsday that an agreement was reached in which “pleas will result in a conditional discharge with no fine, no probation, no jail time and no other punishment in any regard.”
 
Federal jury finds Manganos guilty
A jury found former Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and his wife, Linda Mangano, guilty of corruption charges on a Friday morning in March at the federal courthouse in Central Islip.
Prosecutors said the Republican helped Long Island restaurateur Harendra Singh obtain guaranteed loans in exchange for lavish gifts.
They said Linda Mangano was given a $100,000-a-year, no-show job at one of Singh’s restaurants.
The verdict was announced after a seven-week retrial.Their first trial ended in a mistrial in May 2018.
Ed Mangano was found guilty of multiple counts of accepting bribes and kickbacks in exchange for official government action,and for conspiracy to obstruct justice. Linda Mangano was found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice and making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about her employment by Singh.
U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a statement that Mangano had “abused his power as a public official bytaking bribes and kickbacks from a businessman in exchange for helping him obtain loans worthmillions of taxpayer dollars.
“Among the personal benefitsreceived was a lucrative no-show job for Linda Mangano,” Donoghue added. “The defendants tried and failed tocover up their crimes by lying to the FBI and federal prosecutors, and will now be heldresponsible for these crimes. No one is above the law.”
“In a quid-pro-quo wheeling and dealing, Edward Mangano effectively opened the door that unjustly benefitted restaurateur Harendra Singh, sat idly by while public funds wereexchanged for favors, and waited patiently in the wings to accept a payout for the plan he put inmotion,” William Sweeney, Jr., assistant director-in-charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office, said in a statement.
“In Linda Mangano’s case, she keptup the ruse with a bogus job as food taster and menu planner at one of Singh’s restaurants,” he added. “Whether they believe it or not, today we’ve proven they bit off more than they could chew.”
The panel delivered not-guilty verdicts on additional charges including extortion, bribery and false statement counts.
Standing outside the courthouse Edward Mangano told reporters that he was going to go home and “take care of Linda who clearly should not have been charged in the first instance.”
Edward Mangano said he was “very proud” of his service as county executive and that he “would not and could not be bribed by anyone and I would not allow that.”
Kevin Keating, Edward Mangano’s trial attorney, told reporters he was “bitterly disappointed in the jury’s verdict.”
Both Keating and John Carman, Linda Mangano’s attorney, said they would appeal.
Edward Mangano said he was “confident that we will be vindicated.”
 
National Grid lifts moratorium on natural gas service
In the face of mounting government pressure, National Grid agreed to lift its self-imposed moratorium on new natural gas service for Long Island, Queens and Brooklyn for the next two years and pay a $36 million fine to the state.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo had threatened to pull Natural Grid’s downstate franchise earlier this year if the utility continued to refuse new service.
National Grid said it will connect customer applications that were put on hold due to the moratorium that it imposed in May and start processing all new applications.In addition, the company will offer $7 million in customer assistance to address hardships as a result of the moratorium, according to a National Grid statement.
National Grid has also agreed to $8 million for new energy efficiency, gas conservation measures designed to relieve stress on the system and reduce peak-day gas usage during this two-year period.
“We understand the frustrations of everyone who experienced a delay in service during this period and regret that we did not provide more notice or explanation to our customers about the moratorium,” Badar Khan, interim president of National Grid U.S., said in the statement.“We appreciate the opportunity to work with the governor’s office and the Department of Public Service to address these challenging issues.”
National Grid had been pushing for the Northeast Supply Enhancement Project, a $1 billion pipeline expansion by Williams-Transco, that the company says would increase natural gas capacity in the area by 14 percent, delivering 400 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The utility insists that without it, a natural gas shortage is likely this winter, which is why it enacted the moratorium in the first place.
However, Cuomo asserted there was no legitimate need for the moratorium and that the company’s only plan for future supply was based on the “speculative” and “risky” pipeline expansion project.
Opponents of the pipeline expansion say broadening the availability of fossil fuels like natural gas runs counter to the drive to convert to renewable energy sources. They also claim that companies like National Grid are overstating the need for increased supply of natural gas because of the rise of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency, and some say the self-imposed moratorium is unnecessary and nothing more than a bargaining chip for utilities to use to get the project approved.
National Grid said it would present options within the next three months to meet New York’s long-term supply needs to the communities it serves.The company has committed to present the findings of its analysis through a series of public meetings in Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties, “designed to facilitate a dialogue with customers, residents, advocates, business leaders and local elected officials.”
An independent monitor will be appointed by the Department of Public Service to oversee National Grid’s compliance with this agreement.
Economic development and planning officials praised the lifting of the natural gas ban.
 
The fight to stop anti-Semitism
The dramatic rise of anti-Semitism is fueling a fight to stop it.
In a week that followed the deadly terrorist attack at a kosher market in Jersey City, the Nessah Synagogue in Beverly Hills was vandalized.
On Long Island, New York State Sen. Anna Kaplan spoke out.
“We will not surrender to the surge in anti-Semitism that has swept this country,” she wrote on Facebook. “The State of New York stands with Nessah Synagogue,” and New Yorkers of all faiths send their love and support across this great country to Nessah’s clergy and congregants.”
Last week, after hate crimes on Long Island, including in Glen Cove and Huntington, local leaders vowed to stand up against hate. Nassau County Executive Laura Curran was joined by Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone, Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County Chairman Steven Markowitz and more than 40 elected officials, religious and community leaders to announce an island-wide taskforce against Anti-Semitism and Symbols of Hate.
Also last week Ronald Lauder, the chairman of Clinique Laboratories, one of the Estee Lauder Companies, which has offices in Melville, launched the “Anti-Semitism Accountability Project,” or ASAP. This is a $25 million campaign to combat anti-Semitism.
“Anti-Semitism has become fashionable again and for too long, American Jews have been silent,” Lauder said in a statement.
“It’s time to make our voices heard,” he added. “It’s time to confront our haters, without fear or apology.
Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress said that “ASAP will finally add real teeth in the fight against anti-Semitism in American politics and culture. All candidates and American cultural leaders who traffic in hatred against Jews should consider themselves on notice.”
ASAP will produce and run television and digital advertisements, opposition research, grassroots and “grasstops” outreach, on-campus organizing and rapid response to defeat candidates supporting anti-Semitic ideas.
 
Lawmakers call for legislation to fight illegal dumping
Elected officials on Long Island are proposing legislation to fight environmental crimes and illegal dumping.
The suggested legislation would incorporate recommendations from Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini’s special grand jury report that looked at the impact of illegal dumping and other environmental crimes on Long Island.
Sini and New York State Sen. Todd Kaminsky, the chairman of the senate’s Environmental Conservation Committee, began working on the legislation with other lawmakers in an investigation known as “Operation Pay Dirt,” which looked at illegal dumping.
Conducted by Sini’s office, the Department of Environmental Protection and the Suffolk County Police Department, the investigation resulted in a 130-count indictment charging 30 individuals and 9 corporations.All of the defendants charged pleaded guilty. And the ringleader was recently sentenced to two to four years in state prison.
Now, the state “needs laws that are clearer and laws that have more severe penalties for people who are polluting our environment and risking contaminating our aquifer, the sole source of drinking water for Long Island,” Sini said in a statement.
 
Former County Executive Tom Gulotta, 75, dies
Former Nassau County Executive Tom Gulotta died, LIBN reported on Aug. 5.
Gulotta, a Republican and longtime resident of North Merrick, was 75. He served as county executive from 1987 through 2001.
Local leaders from the region expressed their sorrow, and described Gulotta as a gracious and gifted public servant.
Rep. Peter King released a statement on Twitter in which he described Gulotta as a “governmental and political icon,” as well a “longtime friend and colleague.”
Born in Oceanside, Gulotta was the son of Josephine and Frank Gulotta, Sr., a former Nassau County district attorney, according to published reports. He attended Malverne High School, where he served as student president. He attended Trinity College in Hartford, and then law school at Columbia University.
Later, he would serve in the New York State Assembly, and then as supervisor of the Town of Hempstead when Al D’Amato vacated that seat to serve in the U.S. Senate.
County Executive Laura Curren described Gulotta as a “dedicated husband, father, and public servant.”
 
HIA-LI fostering growth at industrial park
A new task force at HIA-LI is set to implement an action plan to optimize the long-term economic impact of the 1,400-acre Long Island Innovation Park at Hauppauge (up until recently was called the Hauppauge Industrial Park).
The action plan is based on the recommendations of the 160-page opportunity analysis by the Suffolk County IDA and Regional Plan Association that was released earlier this year. Leading the analysis was James Lima of James Lima Planning + Development, a New York City-based planning firm whose client list includes Facebook, several agencies for the City of New York, the University of Tennessee and other villages, cities and foundations.
A 41-year-old organization, the HIA-LI serves as the voice of the industrial park, where 55,000 people are employed. The park delivers $13 billion in annual output, according to the HIA-LI.
The report’s findings show that the park is the “undisputed anchor of Long Island’s 'tradable’ economy,'” which brings “new dollars and commerce into the region,” according to a press release about the new task force.
 
Preparing for Census 2020 on Long Island
Census Day is April 1, 2020, a once-in-a-decade effort in which the government counts the U.S. population.
But even though this information gathering is still nearly a year away, the U.S. Census Bureau is gearing up now for an accurate tally. And that’s important at a time when trust may play a big factor in participating in the count.
The stakes are high, especially for the region’s hard-to-count populations.
“We run the risk of losing a congressional seat,” said Erika Hill, director of programs and community engagement at the Office of the Nassau County Comptroller.
The count, she added, “drastically impacts funds for services for constituents.”
From the count, the federal government also ascertains the number of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for each state.
According to the Health & Welfare Council of Long Island, the data plays a role in funding for a host of services, including Medicaid; schools; Head Start; the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program; Title 1 programs, in which select children with the greatest need receive educational assistance; and special education programs.
Also impacted by the count is the NICE bus service as well as other programs.
Companies also look to this information to determine whether to locate their operations in certain areas. By looking at the data, business owners might choose to set up shop elsewhere if they don’t believe a neighborhood has enough of a local customer base. And that could translate into a missed opportunity for job creation, Hill said.
To step up its accurate counting effort this year, the Census Bureau is hiring. Both Nassau and Suffolk counties recently held job fairs in conjunction with the Census Bureau, which will employ field workers and recruiting assistants as well as office and supervisory staff. These jobs pay between $17 and $23 per hour.
In Suffolk County, about 33 percent of its population live in hard-to-count areas, including Wyandanch, Brentwood, Coram, Riverhead, East Coram, and other locations, according to the Census Bureau. And in Nassau, 23 percent live in hard-to-count areas, including Hempstead, New Cassel, Roosevelt and other communities. When households did not respond to the census questionnaire in 2010, it created challenges. That non-response in 2010 resulted in a “severe undercount” of children under age 5, leading a decade later to underfunding of schools, Hill said. Also undercounted were males between ages 18 and 24, those living in illegal housing, the immigration population and those with limited English proficiency.
Census workers will undergo training to educate households about Title 13 protections, which states that census information will not be shared with other agencies.
In addition, there will be media campaigns though Young & Rubicam, a global marketing and communications company, to spread the message of the importance of being counted to a broader audience. This effort enables the effort to be “culturally specific,” Hall said, noting that it would help people to hear about the census from a “trusted resource.”
For the upcoming census, households will be able to answer questions online after receiving a card with a PIN number, Hall said. But not everyone has the capacity to respond online, especially seniors who are not familiar with computers, and those without access to reliable Internet service. Households can also call to request a paper form, or reply by phone. It’s when they don’t respond that a fieldworker is sent to the home.
Much of an accurate count is based on that effort for inclusion.
“Our demographic reports highlight the need to have a diverse census workforce especially when it comes to the hardest to count communities,” Hill said.
 
Pushing for an offshore wind economy
Advocates of offshore wind spent much of Friday claiming Long Island has a lot to gain.
At a breakfast meeting at the Long Island Association’s Melville headquarters, developers of offshore discussed their proposed projects off the coast of Long Island.
Then at noon, business and labor leaders along with elected officials were at Suffolk County Community College for a forum on wind energy and workforce training.
“Part of Long Island’s future is unfolding right before our eyes,” LIA President and Chief Executive Kevin Law said at Friday’s breakfast. “It’s happening with the support of the federal and state government.”
This push comes at a time when Gov. Andrew Cuomo raised the state’s offshore wind capacity, from 2,400 megawatts by 2030 to 9,000 megawatts by 2035.
The initiative is part of New York’s clean energy standard, which, according to the state, aims to “fight climate change, reduce harmful air pollution, and ensure a diverse and reliable low carbon energy supply.”
With Long Island centered in the middle of the “wind corridor,” from Boston to Washington DC and with cost efficiencies realized, the region could stand to gain, with thousands of jobs not just in the trades, but also legal, accounting and engineering fields.
 
Post-Amazon, leaders look to attract business to region
Nearly 30 regional leaders from government, business and other areas met at the Long Island Association in March for an Amazon post-mortem. The session took place just weeks after the tech company decided not to locate a headquarters in Long Island City.
The event was an invitation-only meeting, and it included elected officials, business owners, real estate developers, bankers and nonprofits.
“We believe our region was tarnished because ‘Long Island City’ has ‘Long Island’ in it,” said LIA President and CEO Kevin Law. That perception could prompt people outside the region to have “a negative outlook” with regards to the region’s future economic development growth, he added.
Now local leaders are determining how best to attract businesses to Nassau and Suffolk counties. Law saidthat Long Island is moving in a positive direction, taking measures to “see what to do as region to make sure the arrows continue in the right direction and don’t backslide.”
Among those elements that are already working is the Long Island Rail Road’s east-side access project and the third track expansion project, Law said.
One resource that Amazon seemed to value above all was talent, which is why New York was initially selected, according to a Bisnow interview with Holly Sullivan, an Amazon executive.
Speaking about Amazon’s request for proposal, Sullivan said, “We specifically referenced a tech talent pipeline.”
Commenting on the talent requirement, Law said, “We have it.”
But given the opposition from some in the community, Amazon wasn’t “confident” that it could maintain good relationships, Sullivan said in the interview.
Now Law is working with stakeholders in the region to ensure businesses “feel welcome in the region.”
 
In Nassau, new reforms in county contracting
Nassau County now has new reforms for how it for procures goods and services.
Officials say the reforms aim to deter corruption and favoritism in county government.
“We’re transforming the way Nassau County does business, increasing oversight and implementing strong controls to guard against corruption,” County Executive Laura Curran said in a statement about the reforms.
“This new policy marks another milestone in our efforts to restore trust and integrity to county government,” she added.
The policy change follows a review that began in 2018 that looked at how the county spends more than $1 billion in procuring goods and services. The changes include input from the county legislature, comptroller, attorney and inspector general as well as from various department heads, officials said.
The reforms are to protect against conflicts of interest and include a vendor code of ethics. There is also guidance on policy that bans those county employees who are involved in contracting from accepting gifts.
The reforms bring a new contractor portal with increased oversight and audit trails, and an office of inspector general in procurement and compliance policy. And there is new procedure for officials who are conducting proposal evaluation as well as for those who are reviewing contracts. The new measures also aim to ensure timely contracts.

9/11 victim fund finally extended permanently

Author: Laura Figueroa Hernandez

Abstract: None available.

Full text: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law bipartisan legislation ensuring the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund remains permanently funded.
Trump signed the bill surrounded by first responders from the tristate area, including several from Long Island, at a Rose Garden ceremony.
"We can and we will keep this nation's promise to you," Trump said before signing the bill that offers aid to those sickened by their work responding to the 9/11 terror attacks.
Trump praised the first responders on hand, calling them "warriors" who responded to the attacks with "love and loyalty."
Trump in his remarks spotlighted two fallen 9/11 first responders from Long Island - Ray Pfeifer of East Meadow and Lou Alvarez of Oceanside - lauding their service following the attacks on the World Trade Center.
The bill signing ceremony marked the final stop in a years-long effort to ensure the fund would remain authorized until 2092. For years, first responders and advocates trekked to the nation's capital to lobby lawmakers to reauthorize the fund every five years, but as the ranks of victims grew older, and sicker, advocates -- including comedian Jon Stewart -- made impassioned appeals to Congress for the fund to be permanently authorized.
Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) and Democratic Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan led the effort in the U.S. House where the measure passed earlier this month.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was the lead sponsor in the Senate, where the bill passed by a vote of 97-2.
King was on hand for the ceremony, along with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who served as mayor at the time of the attacks and now serves as the president's personal attorney.
John Feal, of Nesconset, a longtime advocate, received one of the pens Trump used to sign the bill. He said he planned on taking it to Pfeifer's grave.
"We get to exhale," Feal said. "I'm relieved the 9/11 community is going to be lifted of their financial burden."

Posthumous honor for first responder

Full text: Luis Alvarez, the dying ex-cop credited with helping convince Congress to extend health benefits to his fellow first responders also sickened by Ground Zero dust, was on Wednesday posthumously awarded New York State's public service medal.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave the award to Alvarez's widow, Alaine, and two of his three sons, David and Tyler, at a memorial luncheon to mark the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that instantly killed nearly 3,000 people but also sent insidious particles into the Ground Zero air that would, in the years to come, sicken more than 10,000 others, including Alvarez.
"What did Detective Alvarez do? He went down to Washington, literally in his last days, and he looked the Congress of the United States in the eye and he spoke the truth from his heart," Cuomo said, adding: "And what he said was simple but powerful: he said, put your damn politics aside."
Alvarez's testimony in June came just before he died at 53 of colorectal and liver cancer tied to his work at Ground Zero. Alvarez, of Oceanside, had delivered his testimony beside comedian/activist Jon Stewart, then, within days, went into hospice care in Rockville Centre.
Congress passed the funding bill, which goes to about 2090, and President Donald Trump signed it. Some Republicans had opposed the fundng because they said it wasn't paid for.
At Wednesday's ceremony, the family stood with Cuomo as he signed into law five bills relating to first-responder benefits.
The bills Cuomo signed help reimburse localities for workers granted sick leave over their 9/11 work; increase the number of clinicians authorized to evaluate workers in the New York City Employee Retirement System to apply for a disability pension; extend, by five years, the deadline for an accidental death benefit claim; expand World Trade Center disability benefits for certain retirees; grant FDNY retirees diagnosed with certain cancers a presumption that the cancer was incurred in the performance of duty.
After the luncheon, held before hundreds of motorcyclists gathered at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, the widow rode with the governor on his motorcycle downtown for the annual memorial ride he lea

Cop indicted in murder-for-hire plot

Author: Kessler, Robert E

Publication info: AM New York ; New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]31 May 2019: 5.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2232447577?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A veteran New York City police officer arrested earlier this month and charged in a plot to kill both her estranged husband and the young daughter of a boyfriend was indicted Thursday by a grand jury, according to court records.
Valerie Cincinelli, 34, of Oceanside, was charged with two counts of murder for hire and one count of obstruction of justice, according to the indictment filed in federal court in Central Islip.
The obstruction count involves Cincinelli's alleged attempt to destroy seven cellphones and the records they contain, in order to impede the investigation, the indictment says.
The indictment identifies the targets of the murder plots as John Doe and Jane Doe.
But court papers filed by federal prosecutors Catherine Mirabile and Lara Treinis Gatz have identified the intended victims as the estranged husband and the minor daughter of the boyfriend. Federal indictments do not usually name victims of an alleged crime.
Cincinelli was arrested by FBI agents Friday on a complaint which is usually sworn to by an agent and does not specify individual counts against a suspect, and also does not require a plea.
Cincinelli has been held without bail since her arrest.
A spokesman for Eastern District prosecutors, John Marzulli, declined to comment.
Cincinelli's attorney, James Kousouros, of Manhattan, said: "We are very early in the proceedings and we are conducting a thorough investigation demonstrate Ms. Cincinelli is innocent of all the charges."
If convicted of murder for hire, Cincinelli could face up to 10 years on each count; obstruction of justice carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.
A key person that led to Cincinelli's arrest was identified in court papers only as CS, for confidential source. The cooperator was "romantically involved" with Cincinelli, although one of the two victims of the murder scheme was said to be his minor daughter, prosecutors said in the court papers.
The court papers said that Cincinelli was tricked into talking about the murder plot with a cooperator after she was shown a picture of her "murdered" estranged husbandstaged by the FBI.
The confidential source initially told Cincinelli he would find a hit man to carry out the murders for $7,000, and that he would pay in gold coins, the court papers said. Cincinelli withdrew $7,000 from a bank to pay "the hit man," the papers said.
But eventually the confidential source told the FBI about the plot and cooperated in recordings in which Cincinelli talked about the plot, the court papers said.
Cincinelli was in "a volatile relationship" with both her estranged husband and the confidential source, the papers said.
Cincinelli allegedly said that the hit man should kill her estranged husband near his job in Holtsville, stating "it would not look suspicious because the murder would take place in 'the hood' or 'the ghetto,' " in one of the recordings the confidential source made, court papers said.
Cincinelli used the social media account of the confidential source's daughter to locate her for the killing, the prosecutors said in the papers.
Cincinelli joined the NYPD in 2007 and has been on modified assignment without a gun since 2017 because of domestic incidents, an NYPD spokesman said after her arrest.
After being placed on modified status, Cincinelli had been working with the Viper unit, which monitors surveillance cameras at city public housing areas. Previously she had worked at the 106th Precinct in Queens, the spokesman said. (Robert E. Kessler)

Full text: Astronaut Mike Massimino will be at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City June 21 for the Long Island Air & Space Hall of Fame’s 10th annual induction ceremony.

The Long Island native born in Oceanside and raised in Franklin Square flew on two Space Shuttle missions, STS-109 in 2002 and STS-125 in 2009, during which he successfully completed spacewalks in order to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. Currently a professor at Columbia University, Massimino has played himself as a recurring role on the TV show “The Big Bang Theory.” Another claim to fame: He was the first person to tweet from space.

Massimino, who will also give a free lecture to the public in the evening of June 21, is being inducted along with aviation pioneers and developers Louis and Connie Mancuso, as well as Newsday founder and aviatrix Alicia Patterson.

Each year the Long Island Air & Space Hall of Fame honors and inducts those individuals who have played a major role in advancing aeronautical and technological achievement.

“It isn’t that often that we get the opportunity to meet an astronaut,” Frances Cuomo Perpero, director of marketing and communications for the Cradle of Aviation Museum, said via email. “It’s kind of a rock star moment.”

Michael H. "Mike" Bowler, veteran Baltimore Sun journalist and Baltimore County Board of Education member, dies

Full text: Sept. 19--Michael H. "Mike" Bowler, a veteran Baltimore Sun reporter and editor who covered the education beat for decades and later served as a member of the Baltimore County Board of Education, died Monday at his Catonsville home from pancreatic cancer.
He was 77.
"Mike was a good friend as a journalist and as a Baltimore County School Board member. He was always interested in public education," said Robert Y. Dubel, of Glen Arm, who headed Baltimore County public schools for 16 years before retiring in 1992.
"Mike was a fair person, and as a reporter, he was always fair and accurate. He was always interested in telling the story of education," Dr. Dubel said. "And he was an excellent school board member, and, outside of the teachers I've known, he had a great interest in public education."
Freeman A. Hrabowski III, who has been president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County since 1992, also was a friend for decades.
"When I think of Mike Bowler, I think of the best of journalism and humanity. The man cared so much about education, people, teachers and children," Dr. Hrawbowski said. "He taught us to tell the truth on all occasions and to live authentically. I think of his great sense of humor, smile and laughter, and we will never forget that which reflected a very serious and generous spirit."
G. Jefferson Price III, a former Sun editor and foreign correspondent, was a longtime newsroom colleague.
"Mike Bowler was the consummate newspaperman in his career as a reporter and later as an editor," said Mr. Price, a former Glyndon resident, who now lives in South Dartmouth, Mass.
"He had all the requisite qualities. He could smell mendacity a mile away, though he was amused by scoundrels, he could explain an issue easily and interestingly, presenting both sides without partisanship," Mr. Price said. "He was full of curiosity, enthusiasm, energy and most important, a very hearty sense of humor."
Michael Hendrix Bowler -- he never used his given name or middle initial -- was born with printer's ink in his veins, in Helena, Mont., where he grew up.
His father, Clyde Hendrix Phillips, who was a newspaperman on the Helena Daily Independent and Billings Gazette, died of leukemia when his wife, Edeen Elizabeth Carlson, a homemaker and musician, was pregnant with their son.
His father's newsroom colleague, Duane Wilson "Doc" Bowler, later married his friend's widow and adopted Mr. Bowler.
"He got to know Mike's mother when he came out to visit his father during his illness," said Mr. Bowler's wife of 55 years, the former Margaret French, who is a retired CCBC Catonsville professor and financial aid officer.
Mr. Bowler's excursion into journalism began at Helena High School when he was on the staff of the WASH, an underground newspaper that had been critical of school issues.
"It was a one-edition enterprise, because the principal threatened to kick them out of school," said his sister, Bonnie Bowler, of Helena.
After graduating in 1959 from Helena High School, Mr. Bowler studied at Columbia University where he received a bachelor's degree in 1963.
Mr. Bowler taught English and social studies in Oceanside, N.Y., before graduating in 1965 from the Columbia School of Journalism with a master's degree.
He began his professional career as a reporter for The Reporter Dispatch in White Plains, N.Y., and later worked in public relations for the Lutheran Church of America. While working for The Suffolk Sun in Deer Park, N.Y., Mr. Bowler learned firsthand a lesson about newspaper economics.
"The Suffolk Sun was trying to compete against Newsday on Long Island, when the sheriff arrived one day to padlock up the place, and they knew it was all over," recalled his wife, with a laugh.
In 1969, Mr. Bowler joined the staff of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as an education reporter.
"He was hired to cover desegregation of schools in the South. He had to go out into the countryside to talk to people, but with those New York license plates, people wouldn't talk," his wife said. "So, he always had to go with a local reporter who talked Southern in order to get them to tell Mike things."
J. Reginald "Reg" Murphy -- who was then editor of the Atlanta newspaper and later became publisher and CEO of The Sun -- fired Mr. Bowler after he wrote a memo circulated to editors criticizing the hiring practices of Rich's department store, the newspaper's largest advertiser.
He joined the local staff of The Sun in December 1970 and was assigned to the police and later the obituary beat.
"He dutifully had written an obit for an Obrycki when an editor came over and explained to Mike that there wasn't an apostrophe between the 'O' and 'B' and Obrycki wasn't Irish," his wife said.
Mr. Bowler became a beloved and respected newsroom presence. For many years before smoking was banned from the newspaper's former Calvert Street home, Mr. Bowler's head seemed perpetually wreathed in smoke from his ever-present cigar, which he puffed while typing his stories, first on a typewriter, and by the mid-1970s, on a computer.
"Mike was one of those reporters when I got to The Sun in the early 1970s, who'd talk to you, work with you, and mentor you," said Tom Horton, The Sun's former environmental writer who lives in Salisbury. "He always had time for you. It was a godsend to have someone like Bowler there to help you."
Mr. Horton, a professor of environmental studies who writes a column for the Bay Journal, recalled the first time Mr. Bowler took him to a city school board meeting.
"Our first stop was the Calvert House for a few beers. Mike probably already knew what the story was going to be anyway," Mr. Horton recalled. "And that was my introduction to The Sun. He proved to be an amazing influence on me."
At the time of his retirement from The Sun in 2004, Mr. Bowler reflected on his more than three decade career with the newspaper.
"That's a long time for anyone to work for one employer," he wrote, in his farewell Education Beat column.
"I changed jobs several times, working for The Sun three times and The Evening Sun twice. For nearly half of those three-plus decades, I wrote editorials and edited The Evening Sun's opposite-editorial page," he wrote. "But I always kept at least two fingers on education and wrote this twice-a-week column for 10 years."
Mr. Bowler speculated on "how many millions of words flowed from my computer and before that." After 1990, when The Sun's library went online, he accumulated 1,444 bylined stories, wrote more than 900 Education Beat columns, about 200 of them on the subject of reading alone.
"People have asked me how I could possibly have endured, but in fact the education beat is endlessly fascinating," he wrote. "It covers so much of the waterfront of human activity and emotions."
Jim Burger, a former Sun photographer, said many Baltimore writers got their start thanks to Bowler and his Evening Sun editorial page.
"It's where I began," said Burger, a Remington resident. "I've gone on to write for other publications, and even had a couple columns of my own, but it all started with Mike saying, 'That's a good story. Write it up, and I'll run it.'"
During his tenure on the education beat, Mr. Bowler covered nine city school chiefs -- including the first African-American, Roland N. Patterson, and the first woman, Alice Pinderhughes.
"Covering these men and women taught me that leadership is everything. There does not exist a successful school with weak leadership," he wrote, adding, "I also survived seven Sunpapers publishers."
"Mike was an educator in the best sense of the word. He was always teaching us what valued and really mattered and he did that until the end of his life," Dr. Hrabowski said. "I love that man so much. He changed my life and pushed me to be the very best, and that went way back. Whatever he did, he always knew we could be better."
Ernest F. Imhoff, a retired Sun and Evening Sun reporter and editor, recalled Mr. Bowler as "an offbeat Renaissance newspaperman ."
"He was a skilled education reporter, editorial writer, school system bureaucrat, liberal, Sunpapers striker, freedom of the press champion, lapsed cigar smoker, proud Columbia Journalism School alumnus, happy Evening Sun editorial writer, while most often morning Sun staffer," said Mr. Imhoff, a Mount Washington resident, and friend of nearly 50 years.
Tom Linthicum, former Sun reporter, editor and business executive who later was executive editor of the Daily Record, became friends with Mr. Bowler during their days together at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
"Mike Bowler was the epitome of a good newspaperman and even a better person. He pursued his work and his life with singular passion and enthusiasm that inspired those around him," said Mr. Linthicum, an Alexandria, Va., resident, who teaches journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park.
"He believed deeply that journalists are called to help make the world a better place and his years of education coverage attest eloquently to that," he said.
After leaving The Sun, Mr. Bowler was director of communications for the Institute of Education Sciences at the U.S. Department of Education from 2004 to 2007.
In 2005, Gov. Martin J. O'Malley appointed Mr. Bowler to a five-year term on the Baltimore County school board, where he represented District 1, which included Arbutus, Catonsville, Lansdowne and Relay, until he was replaced in 2015 by Gov. Larry Hogan.
The longtime Catonsville resident was a longtime volunteer at UMBC's Friends of the Library where he worked in the Special Collections Department of the Albin O. Kuhn Library and Gallery, with a focus on its H.L. Mencken collection.
He enjoyed reading three newspapers a day and for years had been a subscriber to the Daniels County Leader, a conservative Montana weekly.
Mr. Bowler had been active with the Baltimore-Washington News Guild for decades. He volunteered at Hillcrest Elementary School in Catonsville, was a volunteer reader at Relay Elementary School where he read "The Polar Express" to pupils.
Despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2013, Mr. Bowler continued volunteering at the Banneker Museum in Oella until recent months.
Mr. Bowler and several of his cronies maintained a weekly poker game.
Former State Senator Julian L. "Jack" Lapides, a Bolton Hill resident and poker club member, recalled his friend: "Mike was a sensitive, caring, liberal person and a brilliant writer devoted to excellence in public education. He was also a good poker player and had a wry sense of humor."
In recent years, Mr. Bowler and his wife liked traveling by cruise ship. He was also a rabid Orioles fan, beer can collector and "The Price Is Right" fan.
Plans for a celebration of life service are incomplete.
In addition to his wife and sister, Mr. Bowler is survived by his son, Stephen P. Bowler of Catonsville; two other sisters, Deborah Bowler of Seattle and Barbara Bowler of Billings; and a grandson.

Full text: Gaspare Valenti, a former associate of the Bonanno crime family who testified against his mobster cousin Vincent Asaro, was sentenced to three years probation on Monday for his role in three federal crimes, including the infamous 1978 Lufthansa Heist at KennedyAirport, officials said.
In a separate proceeding Monday, Asaros' nephew, a Bonanno crime captain, and two other men, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy charges, officials said.
Valenti, 71, who was facing as much as 10 years in prison, got a big break for his cooperation in Asaros' trial from Brooklyn federal judge Allyne Ross. The judge cited what she called Valenti's extraordinary assistance to the government.
Valenti testified at Asaro's November 2015 trial on charges he took part in the heist and the murder of hijacker Paul Katz, as well as other offenses. But in a decision that stunned federal prosecutors and many court observers, the jury acquitted Asaro, 83, of all charges. He was later convicted on a different federal charge and sentenced to seven years in prison.
Nevertheless, according to court officials, Ross lauded Valenti's decision to cooperate against Asaro, with whom he was very close. At the trial, Valenti said he and Asaro were part of the team of robbers put together by the legendary mob associate James "Jimmy The Gent" Burke to steal $5.8 million in cash and jewels from the Lufthansa secure cargo facility at Kennedy. The crime was part of the story depicted in the Martin Scorsese film "Goodfellas."
Valenti is only the second person ever convicted of the Lufthansa robbery. Since all other known participants in the heist are dead, Valenti's case is likely the final chapter of the story. The only other person convicted was Louis Werner, a Lufthansa employee found guilty in 1979 of giving the Burke crew crucial inside information about the cargo terminal.
According to a law enforcement official, Valenti, whose life on the fringe of the Bonanno crime family was marked by continual financial and personal woes, has apparently turned things around and now works a steady job. His attorney couldn't be reached for comment.
Not so lucky Monday was Asaro's nephew, Bonanno crime captain Ronald Giallanzo. In a proceeding before Judge Dora Irizarry, Giallanzo, 47, and two other men pleaded guilty to the racketeering conspiracy charges and agreed to forfeit $2.5 million, said Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue.
Giallanzo was indicted in 2017 along with nine others on charges they were part of a Bonanno racketeering conspiracy involving murder conspiracy, attempted murder, robbery, arson and extortion. Federal investigators said in court papers that Giallanzo became a loan shark with as much $3 million on the street.
Evidence of Giallanzo's wealth was what prosecutors called a "gargantuan home" located at 164-04 86th Street in Howard Beach. As part of his plea deal, Giallanzo admitted making extortionate loans to five victims and agreed to forfeit $1.25 million and sell his mansion. Michael Palmaccio, 46, of Queens and Nicholas Festa, 37, of Oceanside admitted making extortionate loans to victims and each agreed to forfeit $500,000, officials said.

'GLOW' PUTS VIEWERS ON THE MAT &amp; PINS 'EM: Female wrestling series is a winner

3.5 stars
"GLOW" starts streaming Friday on Netflix
Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie) is a struggling actress in '70s-era Hollywood who answers a casting notice seeking only women - a lot of them. What could this be, the increasingly desperate Ruth wonders? She finds out some enough. Washed up director Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron) is casting for an all-female wrestling series, to be entitled "GLOW," for Gorgeous Women of Wrestling. Others are looking for work, too, and the spandex-glitter show seems - at worst - amusing. They include Cherry Bang (Sydelle Noel), who has past ties with Sylvia, and Sheila the She Wolf (Gayle Rankin), who has a keen sense of smell. There's also Tamee (Kia Stevens), Melrose (Oceanside's Jackie Tohn), Jenny (Ellen Wong), Archie (Sunita Mani) and retired soap actress and Ruth's friend Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), whom Sylvia is particularly interested in casting. The show is based on the '80s cult wrestling series of the same name.
"GLOW" is terrific, but how could it be otherwise? The source material alone makes this an instant winner. As proof, check out the original credit sequence from the '80s series (it's online) or the 1985 pilot (ditto). Stars like Jailbait, Gremlina, Brunhilda, Debbie Debutante, California Doll and Cheyenne Cher wore their own signature Day-Glo leotards - a visual sequined assault of Saturn yellow, fire orange and rocket red - and each boasted her own mock killa rap hook. (Tammy Jones: "I'll tap my toes all over your face.") They screamed, strutted, body-slammed and did everything the guys did. But as a sendup of something that was already a sendup, high camp was unavoidable, comedy, too. "GLOW" was very funny.
This 10-parter could have probably written itself, but context, plot and character development are what's really needed to make it into something intelligible. Co-creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch have done that by avoiding the easy temptation of turning this material into a running gag, or the characters into clowns. Instead, they've got lives and back stories, tragedies and triumphs - mostly the former. To us, they've been consigned to the dark underside of an eat 'em up, spit 'em out industry. But to them, the show is a paycheck, a way out, a chance for glory, or a chance for redemption. Where we see a farce, they see "Fame."
And while it may be hard to imagine Brie as a professional wrestler, even a fake one, that is one of the jokes, or the better part of one. With aspirations to "real" acting, Ruth also wants to eat. She's very much into "Method" (Sylvia takes to calling her Uta Hagen) and into exploring her role. That's the other joke, which is mostly on her: There's nothing much to explore.
Sylvia eventually consigns her the villain role in the ring because she's too temperamental. "All the crying, the desperation . . . that's what I hate about you. And relax. The devil gets all the best lines."
"GLOW" is about female empowerment, and couldn't be otherwise, but there's a little more going on - female relationships, and the unique ties that bind, even when frayed by a patriarchy that profits from fraying them.
STAR RATING: 3.5

'GLOW' co-star shares secrets of the pro-wrestling industry: Jackie Tohn will play Gilda Radner in another series

Author: Lovece, Frank; Newsday

Publication info: Dayton Daily News ; Dayton, Ohio [Dayton, Ohio]31 July 2017: D.2.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Pro wrestling may be fake --in the best, most performance-art meaning of the word -- but it's "real-fake" on "GLOW," the acclaimed Netflix series set in the world of 1980s women's wrestling.
"All the girls are doing their own stunts," says Oceanside, N.Y., born-and-bred Jackie Tohn, who plays mischievous Melanie "Mel-rose" Rosen on the comedy-drama, loosely based on the real-life syndicated TV show "Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling." It features an ensemble cast including Alison Brie as Ruth "Zoya the Destroya" Wilder, Betty Gilpin as Debbie "Liberty Belle" Eagan, Britney Young as Carmen "Machu Pichu" Wade and others. "The only time a stunt person would come in would be if a girl did it four or five times and they needed to get another angle. At that point, we're not built to do the stunt and it would be a stuntwoman."
Training with the cast "for all of August of last year," Tohn learned, "There's a way you can throw yourself and look like you're banging your head on the floor by whipping your head back. But you're actually hitting part of your arm. Every time you're throwing your elbow into someone's face, you're at the same time slamming your foot on the mat, because that noise is so loud it's, like, 'Boom!' "
The third child and only daughter of retired physical-education teachers Bella and Alan, Tohn has been acting since she was about 10, with background work as an extra on the PBS kid-sleuth series "Ghostwriter." The actress, 36, was still a student in middle school when she got her first significant gig, playing Tiffany, second cousin of Fran Fine (Fran Drescher), on a 1994 episode of "The Nanny." Her performance impressed the producers enough that they flew her out a second time to play a sort of mini-Fran named Francine in a 1996 episode.
Still in her midteens, she went on to do commercials, some stand-up, an MTV pilot called "Show Me the Movie" and a Fox pilot, "Prudy and Judy," starring her and Laura Bell Bundy ("Hart of Dixie"). "It was about two girls from different sides of the tracks," she remembers. "My dad was an exterminator, her parents were crazy wealthy, and we were teenagers making a public-access cable show. So I would liken it to 'iCarly,' " the Nickelodeon show about two teen girls and their webcast.
After high school, a brief stint at the University of Delaware and an episode each of "The Sopranos" and "Strangers With Candy," the guitar- and ukulele-playing Tohn moved to Los Angeles. She continued acting and pursued a music career.
That led to the singing competition "American Idol" --she was one of 36 semifinalists in 2009's Season 8 -- and the Bravo singer-songwriter competition "Platinum Hit" two years later.
But it's as an actress where she's hitting her stride, guesting in high-profile shows such as "House of Lies" and "Castle," plus two appearances on the NBC afterlife comedy "The Good Place." Tohn also landed the plum role of Gilda Radner in Netflix's upcoming film "A Futile and Stupid Gesture," about the halcyon days of National Lampoon. And then she got to "GLOW."
It was a long time coming. "Ikept just pounding the pavement in my late teens and early 20s and, obviously, to this day. I was like a carny," she says, her voice becoming soft and introspectively. "I was just taking the show from city to city, office after office, and I was like, 'You buyin' what I'm sellin'? Huh? Huh?' until it was exhausting. And then, eventually, someone did."

BEEF, IT'S WHAT'S ... CHANGING THE ARC OF HISTORY, via Amy Chozick of the New York Times: "Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended 'to undermine our democracy' and were ordered by Vladimir V. Putin 'because he has a personal beef against me.' Speaking to a group of donors in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Putin, the Russian president, had never forgiven her for the accusation she made in 2011, when she was secretary of state, that parliamentary elections his country held that year were rigged. ..." http://nyti.ms/2hDIMak
BEST STORY I READ TODAY, HAD ME LAUGHING OUT LOUD -- STRAIGHT-EDGE GLOBE REPORTER TRIES TO BUY POT. Dugan Arnett for the win on the front page of the Globe: "Call me old-fashioned, but I trusted Nancy Reagan when she urged me to Just Say No. I listened when McGruff the Crime Dog insisted that 'users are losers.' And when my younger sister arrived home one night back in high school smelling of the devil's lettuce, I did what any self-respecting graduate of the DARE program would do: I told my mom.
So when my boss approached me to ask if I'd be willing to go out on Thursday - the day marijuana officially became legal in Massachusetts - and attempt to buy some, it's safe to say I was caught off guard.
Apparently she thought if I could get it, anyone could.

But the billionaire owner is hardly crying poor. Au contraire. Ansin confidently predicts he can make money -- even in the first year operating WHDH as an independent station.
'Not as profitable as we have been recently,' Ansin told me Thursday in an interview at WHDH's downtown office, but 'we will be profitable.'
It's a bravado borne out of experience when NBC ditched Ansin nearly three decades ago in similar fashion in Miami. Ansin, who owns the Florida station WSVN, had been the NBC affiliate until the network bought another station and moved its programming over there. Without the network's hit TV shows, it would be harder to sell local ad spots. Still, Ansin decided to become an independent station. ..." http://bit.ly/2hsNvgO

Study says drinking coffee may reduce cancer risk

Author: Ricks, Delthia

Abstract: Pending further research, scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who conducted the study, said people should not begin drinking coffee if they aren't already java drinkers. Those who drink it should not increase their number of daily cups, the scientists said. "Diet and lifestyle affect people's cancer risk, [Jules Garbus] said. He also noted that Dana-Farber's reputation adds credence to the findings. The study's lead investigator, Dr. Charles Fuchs, said it was unclear why coffee didn't prevent the patients' cancers in the first place. "We only identified subjects following the diagnosis of colon cancer so we don't have their coffee consumption prior to diagnosis, he said in an email.

Full text:   Daily consumption of caffeinated coffee may prevent a recurrence of colon cancer in people treated for the disease with the strongest benefits for those drinking at least four cups, according to new scientific research. The new findings come with caveats - and for some doctors, raise a long list of questions.

The study is the first ever to examine whether coffee plays a role in preventing colon cancer recurrence and lowers mortality from the disease among U.S. residents - who consume the most coffee globally.
Dr. Jules Garbus, co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, New York, said the research cannot be easily dismissed because it raises questions about how coffee affects metabolism.
"Diet and lifestyle affect people's cancer risk, Garbus said. He also noted that Dana-Farber's reputation adds credence to the findings. The study's lead investigator, Dr. Charles Fuchs, said it was unclear why coffee didn't prevent the patients' cancers in the first place.
"We only identified subjects following the diagnosis of colon cancer so we don't have their coffee consumption prior to diagnosis, he said in an email.
Fuchs, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber, said people with metabolic disorders have a higher colon cancer risk.
For example, high levels of insulin are associated with elevated risks of the cancer because the hormone can promote the growth of cancer cells. Obesity also is associated with higher colon cancer risk and higher levels of insulin in the blood.
Caffeine helps lower insulin levels and is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, Fuchs wrote in the study.
Nearly 1,000 patients were involved in the research. All had been treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Those who had the best five-year survival rates drank at least four cups of caffeinated coffee daily, consuming about 460 milligrams of caffeine. There was no correlation between a survival benefit and herbal tea consumption, the study found.
Results of the analysis were reported in Monday's Journal of Clinical Oncology. Patients who consumed four daily cups were 42 percent less likely to experience a rebound of their cancer and were 33 percent less likely to die from the disease.
Dr. Robert Amajoyi, a colorectal cancer surgeon at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, N.Y., said while the research sheds new light on a role that coffee might play, he is not yet convinced of a cause-and-effect.
"Coffee has potential anti-mutagenic properties, he said Monday, referring to antioxidants that may help prevent mutations. But it is impossible to say how java consumption affects cancer risk without stronger research, he said.
"That's why I say more studies are required, Amajoyi said, adding that rather than the questionnaire used by the Boston team, he would prefer to see a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, the gold standard of scientific research.
Dr. Peter Bach, a physician and epidemiologist who directs the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, also said more powerful data are required.
"Coffee drinking and lower risk may be related to an unseen third factor. I'm not saying that is the case, but we would only know if this were a true risk-reducing intervention with a randomized trial, Bach said.

Abstract: NYPD officials said a confidential witness mistakenly identified [James Blake] during an undercover investigation into cellphone fraud. Blake told reporters Wednesday that "it shouldn't have happened and it's something that we'll deal with the police and we'll find out what they have to say internally." "If you look at the photograph of the suspect, it looks like the twin brother of Mr. Blake," [William Bratton] said, adding that "race had nothing to do with this." "I've known him to be a good cop who cares about his job," said neighbor Frank Abramo, 63, a retired restaurant owner. "I'm sure he thought he was doing the right thing."

* Blake Take-Down
NEW YORK -- Retired tennis star James Blake seemed relaxed and without a care in the world as an undercover officer rushed up to him and wrestled him to the ground outside a Manhattan hotel Wednesday in a case of mistaken identity, according to a surveillance video released Friday by the NYPD.
The video footage, taken by a camera in the taxi driveway of the Grand Hyatt hotel on 42nd Street, showed a nonchalant Blake standing against a building pillar as Officer James Frascatore suddenly enters the frame from the right and grapples with him before taking him down to the sidewalk.
At one point Frascatore's right arm seems close to getting into a chokehold but appears to actually be resting on Blake's right shoulder before sliding off. Blake was then cuffed behind his back as he was face down.
After cops discovered that Blake had been mistakenly identified, the former tennis star had his hands unshackled and was set free.
The release of the video came a day after NYPD Police Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio apologized Thursday to Blake, whom police said was interviewed Thursday night by the NYPD's internal affairs bureau. The investigation is ongoing.
Thursday night, Bratton released a statement saying that he had "personally apologized for yesterday's incident ... Mr. Blake said he would like to meet with the mayor and me at a future date, which we would be agreeable to."
A law enforcement source said a number of police officials were on the line as Bratton talked with Blake in what was described as a "positive" conversation.
The apology came amid persistent questions over why Blake, 35, was detained while waiting at the Grand Hyatt for a ride to the U.S. Open.
Frascatore, 38, has been placed on modified duty and an independent watchdog group has opened an investigation.
Blake released a statement Friday saying, "When this incident was reported in the news media, Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bratton both called me to extend their personal apologies, and I greatly appreciate those gestures. But extending courtesy to a public figure mistreated by the police is not enough. As I told the Commissioner, I am determined to use my voice to turn this unfortunate incident into a catalyst for change in the relationship between the police and the public they serve. For that reason, I am calling upon the City of New York to make a significant financial commitment to improving that relationship, particularly in those neighborhoods where incidents of the type I experienced occur all too frequently."
PBA president Patrick J. Lynch said NYPD officers regret any embarrassment or injury suffered by Blake as a result. "The police officer was apprehending what he had every reason to believe was an individual who had just committed a crime. The apprehension was made under fluid circumstances where the subject might have fled and the officer did a professional job of bringing the individual to the ground to prevent that occurrence," Lynch said in a written statement.
Blake said he was outside the hotel waiting for a taxi to the U.S. Open when a man later identified as Frascatore charged him and threw him to the ground. The officer did not identify himself as a member of the NYPD at the time, Blake said.
The 60-second silent video showed Frascatore rushing up to Blake, grabbing him by the chest and forcibly turning him around. At that point an apparently startled Blake, who reportedly said he thought at first the cop was a friend or fan, appeared on the video to offer slight resistance and was quickly brought down by Frascatore.
Some passersby glanced at the two men but many on the video appeared to pay no attention to the pair as they tussled. One woman is seen on the video telling Frascatore that something fell out of his rear pants pocket, which he retrieved as he stood up with Blake in custody.
NYPD officials said a confidential witness mistakenly identified Blake during an undercover investigation into cellphone fraud. Blake told reporters Wednesday that "it shouldn't have happened and it's something that we'll deal with the police and we'll find out what they have to say internally."
Earlier Thursday in an interview on CNN, Bratton said that Blake, who is black, had a striking resemblance to a suspect in the investigation.
"If you look at the photograph of the suspect, it looks like the twin brother of Mr. Blake," Bratton said, adding that "race had nothing to do with this."
In his four years as a cop, Frascatore had four complaints filed against him with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, said a police official familiar with the case. One case led to Frascatore's exoneration, one was dismissed and another was sustained for the minor infraction of not disclosing his name tag, said the official, adding that details on the fourth complaint were unavailable.
Frascatore is also named with a number of other police officers as a defendant in two lawsuits over unnecessary force filed in Brooklyn federal court. Both cases relate to events in 2013. In a docket entry filed Friday, the court noted that the city and lawyers for the plaintiffs were in settlement discussions.
Outside Frascatore's Oceanside home Friday, reporters waited for him to appear, while neighbors on the tranquil street defended the NYPD veteran.
"I've known him to be a good cop who cares about his job," said neighbor Frank Abramo, 63, a retired restaurant owner. "I'm sure he thought he was doing the right thing."
Frascatore could not be reached for comment.
Thursday evening, de Blasio and Bratton issued a statement saying the city will try to learn from the incident and is investing millions to retrain about 22,000 uniformed service members. "This Administration will continue to vigorously implement these reforms that build trust and respect between police officers and the people they serve, while also keeping New York City the safest big city in America. And we both stand ready to meet with Mr. Blake to further discuss these issues and initiatives," the prepared statement read.

Billboard reflects kids' art and heart: Drawings thanking essential workers displayed near NYC bus terminal

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The artwork of Kelli-Rose Simpson Forde, 7, went from her front door in Elmont to a huge billboard in Manhattan.
She created art to say thank you to essential workers for Shutterfly's #CreateThanks campaign. The photography company launched the effort as a way to encourage children to uplift essential workers with art, and then share a photo of their masterpiece with the hashtag.
Karlene Simpson, Kelli-Rose's mother, said she's a longtime Shutterfly user and came across the campaign on their website. Simpson asked her daughter if she'd like to participate, and she happily agreed.
Kelli-Rose's drawing included rainbows, smiley faces and stickers, and she wrote "Thank you for keeping us safe" in purple marker.
This message was important to Kelli-Rose for a reason that's close to home: "My grandfather is an essential worker," she said. "He is a bus driver and he helps people go to places."
Kelvin Simpson is a transportation worker for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and became ill with the COVID-19 virus in March. Karlene Simpson said he battled the virus for 2 1/2 months, and recently recovered and returned to work.
"It was hard for [Kelli-Rose] because she was used to running to her grandpa all the time, and she had to stay away," Simpson said. "Now since he's been better and back at work, she doesn't give him a moment to be alone. It's like she's making up for those two and a half months she couldn't be with her grandpa."
Simpson displayed her daughter's artwork on their front door after submitting it to Shutterfly's #CreateThanks effort.
"She was very eager for the people who deliver our packages to see it, because we did a lot of online ordering in this time, of course," she said.
Over in Lindenhurst around this time, 5-year-old Xavier Garcia was hard at work on his own art. He drew two doctors and a nurse with the handwritten caption, "Thank you superheroes!"
Why are they superheroes? "Because they're fighting the virus," he said.
Xavier's aunt is a nurse's assistant at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital in Oceanside, and his mother, April Yeomans, is a substitute teacher for the Half Hollow Hills School District.
Yeomans is an art-certified educator and when she found out about #CreateThanks, she thought it was a perfect opportunity while they were at home during the pandemic. "We didn't expect anything," she said. "He was just doing something nice to show support."
Both families were contacted by Shutterfly and invited to Manhattan on June 15 for a surprise.
Karlene Simpson said she didn't know what to expect.
"That morning, [Kelli-Rose] kept asking me where we were going," she said. "Then, she noticed it before I did."
And there it was: A huge billboard on the corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue that included Kelli-Rose and Xavier's artwork, vibrantly on display. Shutterfly chose this spot, near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, to uplift the commutes of essential workers returning to their jobs during the pandemic.
Yeomans said her son's initial reaction to seeing his drawing on such a huge scale was, "How did it get up there?"
"He got so excited," she said. "He was jumping up and down."
Kelli-Rose said she was "happy and surprised." Her grandfather came along on the Manhattan trip, and they took plenty of photos in front of the billboard together.
Karlene Simpson and Yeomans agreed that they couldn't believe the end result of their children's artistic endeavors. When Yeomans got the news, "I thought it was a scam at first," she said with a laugh.
"I didn't think it was going to become this special moment," said Simpson, who has been collecting her daughter's artwork in a folder since her preschool days.
Kelli-Rose and Xavier will surely keep drawing and delivering messages of hope throughout the pandemic.
Said Kelli-Rose, "To all essential workers, I would like to say thank you for keeping us safe."

Abstract: VALLEY STREAM Inspire Scholarship Brianna Fernandez of Valley Stream High School South is among 12 seniors from the tri-state area to receive $10,000 renewable college scholarships from the Garden of Dreams Foundation, a nonprofit that works closely with the Madison Square Garden Company and MSG Networks to help children in need.

Full text:   Hundreds of Long Island students recently went head-to-head on a different kind of playing field: the magnetic field.
Great Neck South Middle School won six of the 21 trophies - the most of any school - in Brookhaven National Laboratory's 26th annual Middle School Maglev Contest, which challenged students to race vehicles that use magnetic force to levitate and propel them over a track. This year, more than 140 students competed from nine local middle schools.
In a similar competition held simultaneously at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, Levittown's Jonas E. Salk Middle School and Lawrence Woodmere Academy each won four awards - the most of any school. That event attracted roughly 115 students from five middle schools.
"We have a solid young team. I was so proud," Great Neck coach Randy Lane said. "One of the most important things they learned is problem-solving."
Participants built "maglev," short for "magnetic levitation," vehicles according to specifications, in categories ranging from electrified track to gravity to wind power. Judging was based on speed, efficiency, appearance and written design.
In the lab's contest, Center Moriches Middle School and Robert Moses Middle School in North Babylon tied for second with four awards. In the museum's contest, Westbury Middle School earned two awards.

Northwell, Mt. Sinai South get ventilators from nonprofit

Author: Maier, Thomas; Clark, Matt

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]12 Apr 2020: 14.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/2388413265?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two major Long Island hospital groups have received a fresh supply of ventilators from an affiliate of the Orthodox Jewish organization Hatzolah to aid in their fight against the deadly coronavirus, Newsday has learned.
Northwell Health, a regional hospital group based in New Hyde Park, received 25 ventilators and Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside obtained 10 ventilators from the Hatzolah Emergency Air Response Team, known as Hatzolah Air.
For decades, Hatzolah volunteers have provided emergency medical services primarily to Jewish communities on Long Island, in New York City and elsewhere.
Both hospital groups say they have enough ventilators for severely ill patients who need them.
But officials said the new supply will help doctors avoid having to make life-or-death decisions based on the availability of ventilators, particularly if the number of acutely ill patients surges. 
"Every ventilator we receive is important and helpful, given the uncertainty of how long this crisis will last and the extent of the patient volume," said Terry Lynam, a spokesman for the 23-hospital Northwell Health system that includes North Shore University, Huntington and Glen Cove hospitals along with Long Island Jewish and Peconic Bay medical centers. 
Lynam said 22% of Northwell's 3,425 COVID-positive patients are on ventilators, and about 80% of Northwell's ventilators are in use.
Mount Sinai South has 68 virus patients on ventilators, with another 32 machines available.
"As we don't know for certain how many patients will need ventilators, each vent has the potential to save a life, so they are critical in this fight against COVID-19," said spokesman Joe Calderone. 
Overall, government records show that more than 800 virus patients are intubated at hospitals around Long Island. 
With the coronavirus severely impacting the Five Towns area and other parts of Long Island, Hatzolah Air recently approached both hospital groups with offers to donate ventilators.
The nonprofit group, affiliated with the larger Hatzolah organization, provides emergency transport for medical and humanitarian missions.
"We're thrilled to do our part," said Eli Rowe, 50, a director of the Queens-based Hatzolah team. 
"We didn't say it was just for Jewish patients - we gave it without restrictions," Rowe said. The organization collected the machines from various domestic suppliers and organizations, but "we don't have a large supply," he said.
Dr. Aaron Glatt, department of medicine chairman at Mount Sinai South Nassau, said officials had "heard about the ethical dilemmas that hospitals are going to be in if they have to ration ventilators and, heaven forbid, have to take someone off a ventilator, which poses tremendous ethical problems."
Glatt, a rabbi, called the ventilators from Hatzolah Air "a large donation - both in terms of money and unbelievable need - that will be used literally 24/7. I wish it wasn't so. But it will be used every single day for the upcoming weeks, saving lives."
Hatzolah Air is also providing ventilators to a Brooklyn hospital and a medical facility in Rockland County, Rowe said.
He said the group is working to help create a hospital-like facility inside yeshiva Sh'or Yoshuv in Lawrence, where Northwell Health is considering placing moderately ill "low acuity" patients who do not need ventila

Masses are held with fewer people in church

Author: O'Keeffe, Michael

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 Mar 2020: 7.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Turnout was light Sunday for services at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre, but the coronavirus outbreak did not scare away the several dozen Catholics who attended the 11 a.m. Mass celebrated by Bishop John O. Barres. 
Diocese of Rockville Centre officials dispensed Catholics from attending Sunday Mass this past weekend as well as the next two weekends, but churches remained open and schedules were largely unchanged. 
"They have been saying just use common sense, so we came here to praise the Lord," said Lorrie Fusco of Rockville Centre, who attended the Mass with her husband, Joe, and their adult daughter Hope. 
The coronavirus epidemic exploded in the United States during Lent, the 40-day period before Easter, the most important holiday in the Christian calendar. While the diocese announced Friday that churches would remain open this weekend, Barres said attendance had been light at Masses on Saturday evening and Sunday morning. 
Diocesan officials, he said, were monitoring conditions throughout Long Island. "We are assessing things very carefully," Barres said. "Monday morning, we will take a good look at the situation."
Barres said Catholics who are sick, elderly or vulnerable should stay at home until the coronavirus crisis abates, and encouraged them to view Mass on the Catholic Faith Network, available on cable television and through the internet. 
The Archdiocese of New York announced Saturday that it is canceling all Masses in its jurisdiction, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and several counties north of the city. The Diocese of Brooklyn, which includes Queens, did not cancel Masses over the weekend but announced Sunday that it would cancel Masses beginning Monday. 
St. Agnes Cathedral, the principal church of the diocese, may have been open Sunday, but Catholics who attended the 11 a.m. Mass noticed it was not business as usual. Barres warmly greeted churchgoers before the service but refrained from shaking hands. Joe Fusco also noticed that the Sign of Peace - a handshake symbolizing goodwill and brotherhood - had been eliminated. Holy water was not available in the cathedral's fonts. 
Kathleen Murray of Rockville Centre said she believed the news media has whipped up hysteria with misinformation about coronavirus, and she was glad the cathedral had not closed. 
"I am healthy," the 85-year-old woman said. "I have done everything I have been told. I'm washing my hands. I will not stop living my life. If I am going to get it, I'll get it and I will beat it. It's in God's hands."
Barres thanked doctors, nurses, public health officials and pastoral caregivers for the work they have done in easing suffering caused by the pandemic. In his homily, he said he had visited the intensive-care units of the six Catholic hospitals in the diocese. 
"The staffs there are dedicated, heroic and reflect the Good Samaritan face of Jesus to all they serve," Barres said. "The presence of beautiful crucifixes in our Catholic hospitals give so much comfort and strength to our patients and staffs and their presence are critical to expressing the kind of Christ-centered and Catholic mission-inspired care our Catholic hospitals give."
Robert DeVito and Amy Perez of Oceanside said they couldn't justify missing Mass even if they didn't have to attend. 
"Church is an important part of my life and Amy's life," DeVito said. "It's not something we can

Hair, nail salons forced to close amid crisis

Author: Brodsky, Robert

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]21 Mar 2020: 13.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Early spring is typically the busy season for hairdressers and nail technicians at Kutting Kraze, a Bellmore hair salon. Proms. Weddings. Communions. Bar and bat mitzvahs. The shop should be packed every day with customers.
But on Saturday, Kutting Kraze,  a fixture in the South Shore community for 30 years, will be forced to close, along with hair and nail salons and barbershops across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The order, issued Friday by the governors of the four East Coast states, is expected to devastate the wide-ranging personal care services industry, along with its thousands of small business employees.
"It's going to crush us," said Claudette Valenti, who co-owns Kutting Kraze with Stephanie Sheeran. "I don't know how we are going to get back. We are going to fight through it and do the best we can but I don't know how we are going to pay our rent, our bills, our taxes and our payroll."
The pair, who together have 12 full- and part-time employees, have dipped into their savings and not taken a salary in weeks to keep the business afloat. 
Valenti, whose husband owns Piccolo Ristorante,  a Bellmore eatery that was forced to close for all but takeout orders, thinks she can last about six weeks before she's forced to shutter the business permanently.
"If it lasts to the summer there's no way," she said.
The statewide order, which goes into effect at 8 p.m. Saturday,  also impacts tattoo and piercing parlors and hair removal services - industries that require close personal contact with customers.
"These temporary closures are not going to be easy, but they are necessary to protecting the health and safety of New Yorkers and all Americans," said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Erica Kwarta has worked as a hairdresser at Hair Designers  in East Meadow for 34 years. She worries most for her 10 co-workers, along with the suppliers who provide salons with necessary hair care products.
"It's going to be devastating," said Kwarta, 50, of East Meadow. "Many of them have no other source of income."
Some hairdressers said they could provide an occasional haircut in their basement or drive to a client's home. But home visits come with a degree of risk during a fast-moving pandemic, they say, and would defeat the purpose of social distancing.
Fran Klapow, 58, a hairdresser at Salon Montáage  in Oceanside, reluctantly agrees that closing the salon is the right decision. Many of her clients are seniors who, experts say, are the most vulnerable if they contract COVID-19.
"I am concerned for the customers who are in high-risk situations that are not making the right choices," Klapow said. "Our salon is a family. We love each other. Our clients see us more than their own family. I am concerned for all but I think we are all taking this seriously."
Joe Vargas, 41, owner of Evolution Barber Shop, which has operated in Patchogue for 15 years, understands the need to close. But he worries about his six employees who won't see a paycheck until his shop reopens.
"Everyone here has families. They have wives and children," said Vargas of Holbrook. "This came out of nowhere and we were not prepared for it. Most of us don't have savings that will last more than t

Blackfish are late season game: As winds pick up and temperatures fall, LI anglers look for final action

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With the Thanksgiving holiday upon us, there's an urgency now to finish out the fishing and big game seasons on a strong note. That can be tough to do, given the propensity for high winds, chilly temperatures and rain or even snow to roll into town as we dig into the winter months.
Yet fishing and, to a lesser extent, hunting season, never really grind to a full stop here on Long Island. Blackfishing in the Long Island Sound region continues through Dec. 9 while blackfish season for the remainder of New York's waters runs through Dec. 22. At that point anglers can switch to open and charter boat codfishing or mixed bag offshore wreck fishing if they haven't already.
Ice fishing can come into play, too, if we get some frigid air heading into the New Year. Even on the big game hunting front, archery for whitetails continues through the end of January while the January firearms season opens on the 5th and continues through Jan. 31. Once deer season officially closes, many hunters will continue to take to the woods and fields looking for shed antlers and scouting new spots for next season.
For now, though, there can be no denying that options are becoming limited. With most private boats out of the water, charter and open boat fishing for blackfish remains the biggest draw. When the winds have been mild, action with the tautog has run fair to good out of Orient and Montauk points, Shinnecock Inlet and Jones Inlet.
"We've been scoring well with blackfish more often than not," said Capt. Nick Savene of No Time Charters in Oceanside when I caught up to him by phone on Wednesday afternoon. "We are catching our limit on about half of our trips, just missing that mark some days, and occasionally having a tougher day when we have to move around a bit to scratch together a decent catch. Mostly, everyone has been going home with a pile of tasty fillets."
Savene has been working a wide swath of water, concentrating on rough bottom and artificial reefs in 40- to 80-foot depths between Jones Inlet and the New Jersey coast. He noted that green crabs and white crabs are working equally, and anglers are catching blackfish both on blackfish jigs and standard bait rigs.
Out at Orient and Montauk points, skippers looking for blackfish have been running farther form port than in recent weeks. Some have turned their bows toward Block Island while others set a course beyond Fishers Island and up along the Rhode Island coast. Either way, captains have concentrated their efforts in 80- to 120-foot depths where, in addition to the 'tog, a few keeper codfish have also made it over the rails.
With gusty winds predicted for the next few days, it will be interesting to see how the fishing holds up. It's likely the remaining small stripers that have been entertaining anglers in the surf for much of the fall along both the North and South shores will finally depart for points farther south.
On the other hand, with most of the fleet remaining in port for a few days, favored reefs and wrecks will have some time to restock for bottom-fishing fans. That's a tendency for which to be thankful, especially during the holiday season.

LI job data up in Feb.: 15,600 more than in Feb. '17, but loss in health industry

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Long Island economy had 15,600 more jobs last month than in February 2017, its strongest showing since June, state data released Thursday show.
But the health care industry, long the Island's job leader, suffered its first decline since at least 1990, said Shital Patel, labor-market analyst in the Labor Department's Hicksville office. The private-education and health-services sector led employment losses last month, with a 2,000-job decline.
The loss in the sector runs counter to strong local demand for health care services and could reflect staffing shortages, Patel said.
"While the surprising year-over-year decline in health care employment cannot be explained by overall trends in the industry, the aging of its workforce may be weighing on the pace of job growth," she said. "Health care has the largest number of workers over the age of 65 - 15,000 as of the second quarter of 2017 - and hospitals and doctors' offices may struggle finding qualified workers to replace their retiring staff."
Some local hospitals report strong hiring. South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside added 200 jobs last year, said spokesman Joe Calderone.
Likewise, Northwell Health, the state's largest private employer, added 2,000 jobs last year because of demand and expansions, said Judy Howard, vice president of talent acquisition.
But she also said the hospital system has about 1,900 openings including some jobs that are hard to fill, such as physician assistants and specialty nurses.
"Staffing shortages do exist, and they exist in certain job families at Northwell," Howard said.
She added that some health organizations receiving lower Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements may forgo filling vacant positions to cut down on labor costs.
"Some may be experiencing lower reimbursement and are reluctant to add staff," she said.
To hold onto baby boomer health professionals who no longer want to work full time, she said Northwell offers them such options as part-time and per diem work.
In the current employment report, the Island's trade, transportation and utilities sector, powered by retail, added the most jobs, 6,600. Retail accounted for 3,900 of those jobs.
"Although large store closures like Toys R Us dominate the headlines, retail sales job growth rebounded in February," Patel said. "Stores, especially grocery and other specialty-food stores, continue to open across the region."
The Island had 1.32 million jobs last month, compared with 1.30 million a year earlier.
The Labor Department uses year-over-year comparisons because the local data aren't adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations in employment. It adopted its current methodology in 1990.
The Island's 1.2 percent job growth compared with 1 percent for the state and 1.6 percent for the nation in the same seasonally unadjusted figures.
Several upstate metro areas experienced negative job growth. They include Utica-Rome, whose job market shrank 1.5 percent; Elmira, down 1.3 percent, and Binghamton, down 0.1 percent.
The department will release the February unemployment rate on Tuesday. The jobless rate inched up to 4.9 percent in January from a year-earlier 4.7 percent.

Hospital talks stall: South Nassau and Empire BlueCross in contract impasse

Author: Reich-Hale, David

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]19 June 2018: 33.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A negotiation impasse between Empire BlueCross BlueShield and South Nassau Communities Hospital could push the hospital, along with doctors in the system, out of network for patients covered by the insurer.
The contract between the Oceanside-based hospital and Empire BlueCross expired on May 1, and if a deal isn't reached after a 60-day cooling-off period, patients receiving non-emergency care beginning July 1 could be forced to find alternative means for care or pay for out-of-network expenses.
Emergency care would remain covered, the hospital said.
The contract covers the payments the hospital receives from the insurer for its services.
"Our contract rate compared to other hospitals in the area is as much as 40 percent lower," said Richard Murphy, president and chief executive at South Nassau. "Being 40 percent behind some of our competitors puts us behind when it comes to competing for physicians, nurses, support staff, because it obviously impacts our ability to pay competitive wages."
The hospital said that because it's in an active negotiation, it couldn't comment on which Nassau County hospitals it was referring to or how much BlueCross paid it for services.
Hospital officials said they don't have an exact number for how many patients would be affected, but spokesman Joe Calderone said Monday it would likely be "in the tens of thousands."
In a statement, BlueCross said "there is no immediate change to health care coverage for our consumers as we are continuing to negotiate to reach an agreement that would enable South Nassau Communities Hospital to remain part of Empire's care provider network and protects affordability for our consumers."
The insurer added that its customer service representatives would provide consumers with information. The customer service phone number is listed on the consumers' ID card.
Hospitals and insurers are increasingly taking tougher negotiating stands as profit margins thin in both sectors, said Paul Keckley, a health care analyst in Washington, D.C., and Nashville.
"Both sides are looking for more sources of revenue," Keckley said. "The pressure is also why you're seeing health insurance and hospital mergers and acquisitions."
The increase in the number of Medicare and Medicaid participants is also tightening hospital revenue, because "it's substantially less than the margin on a patient covered by commercial payers.
"But in the end, the hospital and the health insurer need each other, so after the threatening letters, and a long negotiation, they figure it out," Keckley said.
South Nassau said it recently reached deals with BlueCross competitors Cigna and UnitedHealthcare. The hospital called those contracts fair, saying they provide it with "adequate reimbursement for the hospital's services. BlueCross refuses to do so."
South Nassau is in the process of joining the much larger Mount Sinai Health System, but final approval on that deal won't take place before later this year, so South Nassau is negotiating a stand-alone deal with BlueCross.
Hospitals regionally and nationally have joined larger health systems, in part, because being part of a larger network gives them stronger negotiating power. In the last year locally, John T. Mather Memorial Hospital in Port Jefferson joined Northwell Health, while Southampton Hospital joined Stony Brook Medicine.

Duca, Woelfel lead South Side

Full text: It sure can get lonely on a cross-country course. Of course, there's a ton of adrenaline at the beginning of a race when the gun releases a pack of championship hopefuls. And the end is full of adrenaline - with the crowd cheering and the finish-line tape coming into view.
But that middle part can get lonesome.
South Side's Olivia Duca was conscious of that and wanted to make sure she didn't let the loneliness get to her.
"In the beginning and the end [of the race], you get the most energy and excitement," Duca said. "In the dull parts, you have to stick to it. [The middle] is mostly everyone's dull part, so if you push hard, you're able to really do well."
And Duca did better than she ever had. The sophomore kept a hard pace the whole way and won the 5-kilometer Class B race in 19 minutes, 24.81 seconds at the Nassau state qualifier Sunday at Bethpage State Park. The time was a personal best, the fastest girls time of the meet, and qualified her for the state public school championships, scheduled for Saturday at Sunken Meadow State Park.
"In the past, I would not run as fast in the middle, but I tried to pick it up this time and I made up a lot of time," Duca said. "I tried to push the pace."
Thanks to Duca and teammate Carly Woelfel - who finished second in 19:43.02 - South Side won the Class B team championship with 42 points and will compete in the team competition at the public school state championships.
Elsewhere, Oceanside's Andria Scaglione won the Class A race in 19:39.06. Syosset, led by Mayu Iio's second place 20:00.08, won the team competition with 65 points. Oyster Bay's Greta Flanagan won the Class C race in 21:08.49 and Oyster Bay won the team championship with 15 points.
On the boys side, North Shore's Jack Rosencrans proved, once again, that he is the top runner in Nassau. He won the Class B championship in 16:10.90. Seaford's Jason Linzer, as he often is, was right behind him in 16:13.95.
Rosencrans said that he and Linzer broke away in the last 200 meters, but were running in a pack for most of the race.
"That definitely forced me to keep my pace up," Rosencrans said. "I was more concentrated on trying to run faster than win. I knew that if I was just concentrating on trying to doing well I would, in the long term, win. Having Linzer behind me in the last 200 meters pushed me, like it always does."
Manhasset, led by fifth place Christopher Courts (17:10.25) won the team title with 50 points.
Farmingdale's Anthony Diaz won Class A in 16:40.70. East Meadow's Bryan Villafuerte was second in 16:43.65 and East Meadow won the team title with 50 points. Oyster Bay's Nick Tardugno won Class C in 17:37.51. Oyster Bay was the only team to score and will represent Class C at the public school state championships.

Calif. man gets 25 to life in fatal Valley Stream shooting

Author: Lam, Chau

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A California man was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years to life in prison - the maximum punishment - for fatally shooting his estranged wife's boyfriend in her Valley Stream home in a fit of jealous rage two years ago.
An attorney for Deon Ewers, 51, said his client shot Majid Morris, 34, five times on Nov. 6, 2015, but said it was in self-defense. But a jury didn't believe Ewers' defense, and on March 28 convicted him of second-degree murder and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon.
The sentence, handed down by acting state Supreme Court Judge Meryl Berkowitz, is what Morris' family sought - but they said it doesn't ease their pain.
"He didn't deserve to suffer alone, in some narrow, godforsaken, dark attic room and bleed on a mattress on a floor somewhere far away from those who loved and cared about him," Morris' widow, who asked not to be named, said Tuesday in Nassau County Court in Mineola.
The Morrises - who a prosecutor said were themselves estranged at the time of the shooting - had a daughter, now 9.
On Nov. 6, 2015, Ewers, of Rancho Cucamonga, flew to New York to surprise his estranged wife and their teenage son, who were living in Valley Stream, according to the Nassau district attorney's office. At about 6:50 a.m., about an hour after Ewers landed in New York, he went to her East Hawthorne Avenue house, and found Morris in an upstairs bedroom.
Ewers shot Morris with a semi-automatic weapon, which Ewers' attorney, James Koenig of Manhattan, said belonged to Morris. Ewers' son, who was in the house when the shooting happened, called 911. One of the gunshots can be heard on the 911 call, according to the district attorney's office. The teen and his mother, who also was in the house, were not hurt.
Ewers fled and was arrested in Oceanside on Nov. 7, 2015, according to the district attorney's office.
Assistant District Attorney Daryl Levy had urged the judge to sentence Ewers to the maximum punishment allowed under the law, saying Ewers intended to kill Morris because he shot him five times, with a long pause between the fourth shot and the final shot.
"This was an execution," Levy told the judge. "This was not self-defense."
Levy also asked the judge to take into consideration Ewers' behavior after the shooting, when Ewers ditched the gun and went to a laundry to wash his clothes in an attempt to hide his crime.
Koenig asked Berkowitz for leniency, saying his client did not have a criminal past, and characterized the shooting as a "crime of passion."
The judge wasn't swayed by Koenig's plea. She also sentenced Ewers to 15 years for the gun charge, which will run concurrently with the murder sentence.
At Tuesday's sentencing, Morris' sister, Jordana Snape, also described the impact his death has had on her and her family.
"The hurt and the pain I feel is unexplainable," she said. "My brother was my best friend."
Ewers, whose attorney said plans to appeal his conviction, did not address the court.

Parade of support for hospital workers

Full text: Hundreds of Long Island residents surprised hospital workers at Mount Sinai South Nassau this week with a parade of cars displaying signs of gratitude for their efforts in the coronavirus fight.
Around 11 a.m. Wednesday, families, police and fire departments began the car procession down One Healthy Way and onto Oswald Court to the front of the Oceanside hospital where nurses, doctors and other staff lined up to watch the people waving signs and honking horns.
"Thank you to our real-life superheroes!" read one sign. "Not all heroes wear capes," read another.
"Based on the hours that these folks have been working and the gravity of the situation, we felt that something needed to be done at this time to try to lift their spirits and pump them up a little bit," said Anthony Cancellieri, parade organizer and vice chairman of the board of directors for Mount Sinai South Nassau.
Cancellieri said the idea came from Joseph Fennessy, the board chairman, who had seen community-led parades for hospital staff in other parts of the country.
The parade of 400 vehicles included 20 fire trucks and more than a dozen police cars from towns surrounding the hospital, Cancellieri said.
Community members have been showing their support to hospital workers every day, dropping off food, soda, cards and hopeful messages from kids, Cancellieri said.
"You can sense that the community just wanted to put their arms around the hospital and hug the hospital," Cancellieri said.
It took one week to organize and execute the plan to have the community rally in a car parade, he said.
Signs were collected afterward for display on the fence around the hospital to help boost the spirits of hospital workers as they enter the building, organizers said in a news release. 
Cancellieri said he stood with hospital workers to watch the 20-minute parade.
"To stand there and take in what these angels were experiencing when they were looking at all of the community" - in some cases their spouses and children - "it was heart-wrenching," Cancellieri said. "People were crying and they couldn't believe it. A wonderful 20 minutes. Probably the best 20 minutes of m

Police: Off-duty cop shot friend

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An off-duty NYPD officer fatally shot his childhood friend in the head during an argument in front of a Farmingdale house on Tuesday evening, police said Wednesday, and the state attorney general's office is investigating the shooting. 
Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder, speaking to reporters at an unrelated event in Oceanside, said the encounter between the police officer and the victim escalated from a conversation to a physical struggle.
"There was an altercation between two gentlemen; it started over a conversation they were having," said Ryder. "They met up. A struggle ensued. During that struggle, a weapon was produced and the victim was shot and killed. The person that was involved in that struggle, fighting also with that other individual, was a New York City police officer."
Ryder did not say whether the officer had been charged with the killing. When asked whether charges would be filed against the officer, Det. Lt. Richard LeBrun, a police spokesman, declined to comment.
Ryder said the officer was "fairly new" to the job and had been assigned to a Queens precinct. The victim was a 25-year-old man whom police did not identify. 
"The suspect and victims were childhood friends; they grew up together," Ryder added, saying the investigation by Nassau homicide detectives is ongoing. Ryder did not explain what prompted the fight. 
A spokesman for state Attorney General Leticia James, whose office in 2015 was granted investigatory powers via executive order to probe police shootings of unarmed civilians, said the office is investigating the circumstances of the fatal shooting. 
The police officer, whose name has not yet been publicly released, was hired by the NYPD in 2019 and was suspended without pay for 30 days following the deadly shooting, NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said in an interview Wednesday. 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, speaking at a virtual news conference Wednesday morning with Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the department was notified "almost immediately" after the shooting.
"He was an NYPD officer that discharged his firearm," Shea said in brief remarks. "As a result of that discharge, an individual was struck in the head and killed, and it's an ongoing and very early part of that investigation."
Nassau police officers responded to a 911 call around 8:05 p.m. for a shooting on Langdon Road and found the body, police said. 
Mary Fanelli, 62, an analyst at a medical supply distributor who lives on the street where the killing took place, said a woman who identified herself as the victim's stepmother came to the scene Wednesday and said both men had attended Farmingdale High School together. 
"It was pretty disturbing," said Fanelli. "Nothing like this has ever happened in this neighborhood."
LeBrun did not provide answers to several questions Wednesday, including whether the officer used his service weapon in the shooting, whether the victim was armed and whether either of the men were under the influence at the time.

Full text: New York health officials said they believe federal permission for in-state testing of coronavirus to expedite results "is imminent," while the number of people monitored on Long Island for possible exposure continued to fall.
The Nassau County Health Department reported Friday that 71 people were being monitored daily and in voluntary self-isolation, down from 79 on Thursday, and the Suffolk Health Department said 21 people there were in home isolation, down from 30 on Thursday.
Both health departments said they have received complete cooperation from those asked to isolate themselves, who are people who recently returned from China. None has exhibited symptoms of the virus, called COVID-19, officials said.
Nassau is asking everyone in isolation to avoid any contact with other people, including family members, said Health Department spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain.
"A person can go out in their backyard and get air," she said. "We don't want them at their fence line talking to their neighbors."
Suffolk's Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott said Suffolk is recommending that anyone in isolation limit contact with others, by sleeping in a different room than a spouse, for example.
"If you're coming together for meals or something like that, then the person who is under self-isolation should be wearing a mask," he said.
Dr. Aaron Glatt, chairman of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside, said that "ideally no one should be going near them" because even though surgical masks reduce the chance of transmission of the virus, they do not completely prevent it.
"You put somebody in isolation, they're not supposed to be near anybody," he said. "It's only if someone comes near them that you use this type of mask."
Laurain and Pigott said that their respective counties, upon request, can deliver food to people in isolation, and can bring masks and thermometers as well.
Each person in isolation is asked to take their temperatures regularly and stay in contact with health authorities. If they were to develop symptoms, such as a fever, they would be transported to a hospital, with emergency medical service workers notified that the person may have COVID-19, county officials said.
The monitoring period is 14 days from the time the person returned from China.
Six people in Nassau have been tested for the virus and all tested negative. No one from Suffolk has been tested. Health experts have asked the public to follow common-sense prevention measures to avoid exposure to viruses.
Currently, only the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can confirm whether someone has COVID-19. New York asked the federal government that its Wadsworth Center laboratory be allowed to perform tests, to decrease delays in getting results.
The state Health Department said in an email Friday that "upon FDA [Food and Drug Administration] approval, which we believe is imminent," Wadsworth can immediately begin tests with a CDC-developed protocol.
Sixty-four Americans have tested positive for the virus, as have more than 83,000 people worldwide. More than 2,800 have died, the vast majority in China.

FIRE MARSHAL A VIRUS VICTIM: FDNY INVESTIGATOR JOHN KNOX, 83, DIED ON LI MONDAY OF COMPLICATIONS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Longtime New York City fire marshal John Knox, who investigated hundreds of blazes during his 36 years with the FDNY, died on Long Island Monday from complications from coronavirus, according to department and union officials.
Knox died at Mount Sinai South Nassau Medical Center in Oceanside, after spending nearly three weeks in the hospital with what first appeared to be the flu. Knox, of Queens, was 83 years old. 
"Our sympathies and prayers go out to the Knox family during this especially difficult time, following the tragic loss of their beloved husband, father and grandfather," said Gerard Fitzgerald, president of the FDNY-Firefighters Association. 
"John was a proud fire marshal representative in the Uniformed Firefighters Association and served this department and his fellow fire marshals for many years. We are thankful for the memories and grateful to his service to this city and this union," Fitzgerald said. 
Knox, who investigated the 1975 FALN Fraunces Tavern bombing that killed four and injured more than 40, struggled with respiratory problems after working at Ground Zero in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. 
It was not clear how Knox became exposed to coronavirus, which has infected more than 1,000 people in New York State. 
"The patient - who had not traveled to any high-risk countries or been exposed to someone with symptoms of COVID-19 - was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 26th and did not meet the CDC criteria in place at the time for COVID-19 testing," Mount Sinai officials said in a statement. "He did have an underlying chronic health condition as well as new symptoms. He later was diagnosed with COVID-19." 
Many of Knox's family members are in self-isolation due to COVID-19 exposure, the Mount Sinai statement said.
Nassau County on Tuesday reported the death of its first resident due to coronavirus, a day after Suffolk reported its first three deaths.
Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said on Tuesday that the first resident to become a casualty of the outbreak was a 96-year-old man who died at Mercy Medical Center on Monda

HONORS FOR 9/11 VICTIM ADVOCATES: CITY RECOGNIZES THOSE BEHIND HEALTH FUND WIN

Author: Alvarez, Maria

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For their tireless efforts that eventually resulted in lifelong health care and compensation for those who fell ill at Ground Zero, 18 New Yorkers received the city's Bronze Medallion on Monday in a morning ceremony at Broadway's historic Beacon Theatre.
Mayor Bill de Blasio handed out the awards, which recognized the first responders and volunteers - still ailing from working on the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attacks - for convincing Congress to renew the Sept. 11 Victims Compensation Fund through 2092.
The bronze medallions, the highest honor bestowed by the city recognizes "outstanding achievement." The mayor praised the families and their loved one's who died while the protracted fight to get the funding renewed continued over 10 years.
"We're here to honor today those who sustained this fight," de Blasio said, "those who believed that we could not give up."
The mayor also acknowledged the collective lobbying of nonprofit groups, the New York Congressional Delegation and city unions whose "kindness and courage reminded the nation that you can't just give lip service to those that serve.''
The event included solemn benedictions, an emotional rendition of "Amazing Grace," and a bagpipe and drum performance by members of the city's uniformed departments.
Monsignor Robert Thelen, a chaplain for the city Department of Sanitation, described those honored as a "righteous community ... fighting for decency and fairness. "It's a bitter sweet moment.''
A moment of silence paid tribute to those who have died of 9/11-related illnesses. A standing ovation met the announcement of awards for posthumous recipients that included FDNY firefighter Ray Pfiefer, FDNY Paramedic Deborah Reeve, and NYPD detectives James Zadroga and Luis Alvarez.
Alaine Alvarez, the wife of Luis Alvarez, said after Monday's ceremony: "I am in awe that all these people came together to make this happen."
A resident of Oceanside, Luiz Alvarez, 53, died in June, shortly after his congressional testimony with activist and comedian Jon Stewart that many considered pivotal in convincing lawmakers to renew the fund.
"Today, I never take a day for granted," Alvarez said. "I will spend it making sure that other families get the support and help they need.''
Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-Manhattan), who received a medallion, recognized the city's unions.
"They were the rock that led and provided the research," Maloney said. "They are a big part of our victory.''
September 11, 2001 was "the worst day - most sorrowful day,'' said medallion recipient Rep. Pete King (R-Seaford). The country came together after the attacks, King added, "but New York is a different breed. We have guts and the rest of the nation saw that. ... Those who suffered did not die in vain.''
Other recipients included Ben Chevat, executive director of 9/11 Health Watch and Kimberly Flynn, director of 9/11 Environmental Action and a 9/11 children's advocate. Another honoree, Lila Nordstrom, founded StuyHealth to encourage former students at Stuyvesant High School like herself to have a doctor check for 9/11-related illnesses. The high school is located about five blocks north of the World Trade Center.
In the audience, Bertha Merriweather of Bay Shore, whose son Tommy, an NYPD detective, died of pancreatic cancer at 48, said she continues assisting those who are ill.
"There are lots more people out there who worked Ground Zero who need our help, sick in their beds, too sick to travel ... there is still so much more to be done,'' said Merriweather, of the Helping Our Post 9/11 Survivors.

from hollywoodlife.com: Hemsworth wishes Cyrus 'nothing but health and happiness'

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his first formal statement since he and Miley Cyrus announced their separation after seven months of marriage, Liam Hemsworth late Monday acknowledged the breakup and denied reports he had spoken with a tabloid.
"Hi all. Just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward," the "Hunger Games" star, 29, posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of an oceanside dawn or sunset with mountains in the background.
"This is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets," the Australian native added. "Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love."
The tabloid Daily Mail Australia quoted Hemsworth, youngest of the three Hemsworth actor brothers, as telling it on Monday, "You don't understand what it's like. I don't want to talk about it, mate."
On Saturday the couple's representative told People magazine, "Liam and Miley have agreed to separate at this time. Ever-evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what's best while they both focus on themselves and careers. They still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart. Please respect their process and privacy."
The following day, singer-actress Cyrus, 26, echoed some of the statement's language in a social-media post that began, "Don't fight evolution, because you will never win." She added later that day in two Instagram posts, showing her against a backdrop of the Dolomites mountain range in Italy, "New day. New adventure. Life's a climb... but the view is great."
While those words are not in the lyrics of Cyrus' 2009 song "The Climb," from her Disney film "Hannah Montana: The Movie," some commenters saw a connection. "Mad Men" actress and "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" star Kiernan Shipka quoted the first line: "I can almost see it." Additionally, Paris Jackson and Paris Hilton commented with approving emoji.
Cyrus and Hemsworth married on Dec. 23 following years of an on-and-off relationship. The two began a romance after meeting on the set of their coming-of-age romantic drama "The Last Song" in 2009, but broke up and reunited at least twice before initially becoming engaged in 2012. They called off the engagement in September the following year.
The two were reconciled by January 2016, and photos emerged that month of Cyrus and a movers' truck as she appeared to be moving into Hemsworth's since-destroyed Malibu, California, home, and wearing what appeared to be her old engagement ring.

Thinking of buying to rent? Eight tips: It's a full-time occupation, an expert says

Author: Abraham, Betsy

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]08 Nov 2019: 8.

Full text: In theory, becoming a landlord seems easy enough: purchase a home, hand someone else the keys, and collect a monthly rent payment. But managing a residential property isn't a matter of simply signing on the dotted line. From buying the home to picking tenants to making sure the heat stays on, there's a lot that goes into being a landlord, say those who own investment properties on Long Island.
Despite the work it entails, if it's done right, Long Islanders can see a pretty penny when it comes to real estate, landlords, real estate agents and attorneys say.
"Real estate is the best investment," says Wendy Liotti, a real estate agent   with Rowan Realty in Carle Place. "If you are considering an investment property, make sure you are prepared to be a landlord. Despite the inconveniences, owning property can be profitable and well worth the effort involved."
Here are a few tips to keep in mind if you're considering making the leap.
1. It's not as easy as it looks
While owning a rental property may be profitable, it is also a commitment that takes up a significant amount of money and time, says Ian Wilder, executive director of fair housing agency Long Island Housing Services in Bohemia and a former real estate attorney.
"My first piece of advice is to consider this a full-time business," says Wilder. "Make sure you have the time and resources available to devote to it. It's not something that will be an ATM that provides cash for you once you purchase it."
Ali Rizvi, a builder with R2 Restoration and Design in Woodbury, owns five residential properties on Long Island, as well as several upstate.. He notes that while buying a rental property is easy, making sure it's well maintained is the hard part. Rizvi says he visits his rental properties twice a week and as needed when issues - such as fallen trees or plumbing problems - arise.
"The key thing is maintenance. I drive by and make sure there's no garbage outside. During the winter, I have to make sure snow removal is happening really early," Rizvi says. "My maintenance also includes a check to make sure the people who said they're going to live there are actually the people who are living there. I have to make sure they're not subleasing it."
2. Be prepared to pay
Landlords should be sure to have a good amount of money set aside to take care of mortgage payments, insurance, maintenance and upkeep costs, as well as additional permits that may be required from the town or village, real estate agents say. Property owners can only claim one property for STAR exemptions, so if you're not planning to live in the same dwelling as your tenants, be prepared to pay full real estate taxes on your rental property, Wilder says. 
It's also prudent for landlords to have a certain amount tucked away for potential legal fees, says Liotti.
"Sometimes tenants are not fulfilling the terms of their lease and stop paying rent," says Liotti. "If this happens, you will need to hire an attorney to start eviction proceedings."
3. Do your research
Darrie Dolan, 47, inherited a Freeport rental property from her grandfather. Four years later, she advises anyone looking to become a landlord to "research, research, research."
"If you don't, you're the one who's going to suffer," says Dolan, an Oceanside resident.
On the list of things home buyers should research, Dolan says, are landlord and tenant rights. 
"You would think you only need to know your rights, but knowing the rights of your tenants can help you make better decisions," says Dolan.
Rental laws can differ across county, town and village lines, and buyers should be vigilant in making sure the property they are interested in renting out is zoned for its intended use, says Liotti.
"Just because a property is currently being used as a multifamily dwelling does not mean the current owner is following the zoning requirements of the municipality where that property is located," Liotti says. "A trip to the building department in the municipality where that property is located could confirm permitted use and also show whether there are any open permits or violations on the property. A title search will uncover any liens on the property."
Study the neighborhood your investment property is in, says Jaishree (Jane) Zilpelwar, a real estate agent with Realty Connect USA in Woodbury. She suggests that individuals find out how much other landlords are charging for rent and price  their apartment competitively.
"Suppose a house is going for $3,000. Price yours at $2,950. It's more attractive and you'll have more interest," advises Zilpelwar.
4. Location, location, location
Buyers unsure of where to purchase should consider looking at communities close to highly rated school districts and train lines, says Zilpelwar. She says many of her clients look to rent in Hicksville, Levittown, Bethpage and Plainview, because of their proximity to Long Island Rail Road stations and the easy commute to the city.
"One of the biggest reasons people want to buy or rent in Hicksville is because they can park in the parking garage if they're a Town of Oyster Bay resident," she says. " And a lot of them would rather walk to the train station."
Steve Rosmarin, an agent with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Westhampton Beach, says the most important thing to keep in mind when buying a rental home is the annual property taxes.
"Since the tenant doesn't pay for taxes, you want to make sure you're not spending all your income on taxes," he says. "The property should be profitable."
Rosmarin owns rental properties in Quogue, an incorporated village, and in Quiogue, a hamlet - both in the Town of Southampton. Annual taxes for both homes are each under $4,000.
"If I rent something out for $3,000 a month and only have to pay $4,000 a year in taxes, that's basically $32,000 in profit," Rosmarin says. "There's a big difference between that and paying $20,000 in taxes."
5. Make sure the home looks good inside and out
Landlords looking to fill a home quickly should avoid purchasing a home that needs a lot of renovations - after all, an empty home makes no money, Zilpelwar notes. While properties don't have to be completely upgraded, they should be move-in ready and thoroughly - if not professionally - cleaned, says Zilpelwar.
"You put a fresh coat of paint in a clean house and it's magic," advises Zilpelwar.
Simple maintenance is also key, Zilpelwar adds. Doors and windows should close, appliances should work, and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors should be in place. Don't neglect the outside either - untrimmed hedges can send a message to tenants that their landlord doesn't care about the property, Zilpelwar says.
"When the house is well-maintained, if something breaks, tenants know the owner will take care of it," Zilpelwar says.
6. Screen your tenants
Liotti advises that landlords carefully screen their tenants, a service that can be performed by companies such as the Tenant Screening Center, SmartMove, MyRental and the National Tenant Network, which will perform comprehensive background and credit checks. But be aware: If you're planning to pass the cost of the screening onto the tenant, New York State laws say they legally cannot be charged more than $20, says Liotti.
"Screening is important to eliminate tenants with criminal or prior eviction records," Liotti says. "It is also important to review their income and employment history to make sure they can afford the apartment and that they have a secure job. If a landlord has to evict a tenant for not paying their rent, it can be a very costly process."
If you're wary about screening your tenants yourself, Karin Leger, an insurance agent who manages a home owned by her parents in Westbury, suggests passing the task on to a real estate agent.
"Look for the guidance of your Realtor to help. They have much more exposure and can be much more objective when they vet someone," says Leger.
Leger also recommends asking potential renters for references.  "You want someone who will treat the home as if it is their own and be a good neighbor."
Landlords should be well aware of the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, disabilities, sex, religion, marital or military status, or sexual orientation, among other characteristics.
7. Build a relationship with your tenants
A good relationship between tenant and landlord is beneficial for everyone, says Wilder. "This may be a business transaction for you, but for your tenant, it's their home," says Wilder.
It's important for landlords to be readily available to their tenants and highly responsive to issues - especially those regarding safety - that may arise, says Wilder. Maintaining a positive, respectful relationship has been a huge help for Dolan, who has had the same tenant for four years, she says.
"You have to find a tenant you get along with and you know they're going to do the right thing,'' says Dolan, ''whether it's telling you the dishwasher is broken or telling you they lost their job and are going to be behind on their rent."
8. Recordkeeping is key 
One way both landlords and tenants can protect themselves is by keeping solid records, says Wilder. That includes receipts for payments and a written lease, he adds.
The lease - which should include the name of the property owner (as opposed to a manager or another intermediary) and tenant - should clearly outline expectations such as the cost of monthly rent, length of the contract, any utilities a tenant is expected to pay for, penalties for late payments and if there are amenities outside the home, such as a backyard, patio or parking space, they have access to, says Wilder.
Liotti also encourages landlords to require a provision in the lease that allows them to inspect the property if the tenant has been given ample notice.
A lease "provides a sense of security," says Wilder, and

OFFENSE: DYNAMIC QBS SLUKA, CAMPISI WILL GUIDE LI

Full text: Don't be surprised if the 2019 Empire Challenge football game on Friday takes on more of a Long Island Air Show look.
In the annual game that pits all-star teams from Long Island and New York City against each other, the Island's offense will feature a pair of ultra-dynamic quarterbacks in Kellenberg's Matt Sluka and St. Anthony's Greg Campisi. Both were Newsday All-Long Island first-team selections last season.
"I see our team as capable of making big plays from scrimmage," Sluka said. "With wide receivers like Jordan Clinton [Floyd] and Jake Lazzaro [Oceanside] things could get pretty explosive."
"There are a lot of very-talented receivers, some of the best I've seen," Campisi said. "And of course you have to know that both Matt and I trust our arms."
The game is scheduled to kick off Friday night at 7 p.m. at Hofstra's Shuart Stadium. The proceeds will go to the Boomer Esiason Foundation to combat Cystic Fibrosis.
"It's a game, you can't help but get excited about," Campisi said. "Some of the players were people I knew. Others were just names in the newspaper. But the talent-level on the team is incredibly high."
"If anything has surprised me it's how quickly all the players are taking to learning the offense," Sluka said. "It's about a week of practices and the players aren't just talented but also smart. In a short time we're getting things down."
Sluka steered Kellenberg to an 11-0 mark and a second straight CHSFL AA championship to finish his career 22-0 as a starter. He completed 69 percent of his passes for 14 touchdowns and was intercepted only once. He also rushed for more than 1,100 yards and 22 touchdowns. Sluka will take a post-grad year at Peddie Prep in New Jersey.
Campisi was 138-for-229 passing for 2,189 yards and 25 touchdowns as the Friars finished 7-2 and reached the CHSFL AAA semifinals. He also ran for 12 touchdowns. He is going to Harvard next year and will play lacrosse.
Sluka said that after spending his football seasons going against many of the players who are now his teammates, he likes lining up with them.
"You kind of wonder what everyone is made of when you're playing against them," he said. "I really like what I've seen."
"Long Island won last year so we have to keep it going," Campisi said, referring to the 28-27 win last June. "I look at our team and have to believe we have what it takes."

Lawyer wants bail for officer

Full text: A lawyer for an NYPD police officer charged with a murder-for-hire plot said the government has selectively excerpted or misinterpreted her text messages and internet searches to block her from getting released on bail.
"[T]hese text messages do not support pre-trial detention, and, in fact, plainly rebut many of the government's contentions," James Kousouros, the attorney for Valerie Cincinelli, said in court papers responding to prosecution arguments.
Cincinelli, 35, of Oceanside, was arrested in May on charges that she plotted to kill both her estranged husband and the daughter of her boyfriend, who has not been charged and is cooperating. She is being held without bail and prosecutors say she is a danger to the community.
The boyfriend, who was in a volatile relationship with Cincinelli, went to federal officials with details of the plot, after initially telling her he would find a hitman to carry it out, officials have said.
In opposing Cincinelli's release on bail, government prosecutors have argued in court papers that her cellphone records show that she was angry over her boyfriend's purchase of luxury goods for his teenage daughter and furious that her husband could get a share of her police pension in a divorce settlement.
Prosecutors presented text messages showing Cincinelli complained to the boyfriend that he was buying his daughter Louis Vuitton handbags, Sephora makeup, and her "fake nails" every week. Cincinelli's internet searches, they said, involved the disposition of pensions in a divorce, and the Amy Fisher-Joey Buttafuocco assault case.
In that case, which was a tabloid sensation in the early 1990s, Fisher, then 17, was convicted of assault after she shot Buttafuocco's wife at the couple's Massapequa home.
Kousouros' papers did not address the searches on the Fisher-Butafuocco case.
But as to her pension queries, Kousouros said in papers: "While Ms. Cincinelli may not have been thrilled that...she had to forfeit part of her pension," she and her husband had worked out a settlement. Kousouros add

Philip Bernstein, 24, gifted software programmer

Author: Schneider, Craig

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At 9, Philip Bernstein was already an entrepreneur.
He tried to get the other fourth-graders at his Port Washington school to put their lunch money into a lottery.
And he tried to charge kids to play on a makeshift swing he made by hanging jump ropes from the jungle gym, recalled Michael Krellenstein, his friend and fellow entrepreneur in those days.
Their schemes failed miserably, but Bernstein would go on to make big money only a few years later. At 15, Bernstein got bit by the computer bug. He taught himself software programming and was selling mobile apps online, said his father, Adam Bernstein. 
Philip Bernstein died Wednesday at the age of 24 of an undetermined cause, his father said. He lived in Long Island City, Queens, with his longtime girlfriend, Michela Petruzziello.
"He was at the top of his life," Adam Bernstein said. "He was with a very promising New York City startup on the cusp of doing great things."
Bernstein was born to Adam and Jane Bernstein in Mineola in 1995, the first of four children.
When he was transforming himself into a teenage app developer, Bernstein spent much of that summer in his room with a laptop and textbooks. 
Then, after hours of study, Bernstein called in his dad to show off what he had learned. Adam Bernstein recalled the look on his son's face - that look-what-I-can-do look. 
Bernstein had programmed his cellphone to beep from his computer. The next day, he set an alarm on the phone, Adam Bernstein said.
"It was slow at first," Adam Bernstein said of his son's self-education. "Then, he took off like a rocket ship." 
Within months, Bernstein was making as much as $1,000 a month from his app sales, his father said.
At 19, he applied for a job as an app programmer. The company's chief executive told him that he was too young and inexperienced.
"You're wrong," Bernstein told the CEO, according to his father. "Give me something you would have me code and in 24 hours I'll have it back to you."
The CEO took the challenge. Bernstein came through. 
"When can you start?" the CEO asked.
At the time of his death, Bernstein was lead software engineer for Manhattan-based HiThrive, which lets customers post compliments about workers. 
Bernstein also loved playing pranks using technology, his father said. In high school, he installed a program on a teacher's computer that made the CD drive randomly open and close. When the frustrated teacher couldn't figure out what was going on, Bernstein stepped forward and fixed it.
Besides his parents, Bernstein is survived by sisters Jennifer and Rachel, both of Port Washington; a brother, Jacob, of Port Washington; and grandmothers Susan Bernstein of Oceanside and Mary Jane Sexton of Syracuse.
The funeral will be 9:30 a.m. Monday at Port Jewish Center in Port Washington. The family will sit shiva Monday through Wedne

MAN GETS 30 YEARS FOR KILLING AT MINI MART

Full text: A Queens man who pleaded guilty last year in the killing of a Valley Stream convenience store clerk was sentenced Monday to more than 30 years in prison.
U.S. District Judge Sandra J. Feuerstein said she gave Jermaine Jackson, 25, of Queens Village the 365-month sentence because there was no reason for Jackson to fatally shoot Edwin Lopez during a December 2016 robbery attempt.
"He did not have to kill Mr. Lopez," Feuerstein said after imposing the sentence in federal court in Central Islip. "There was no reason."
Prosecutors said Jackson was wearing a mask over the lower portion of his face and brandishing a semiautomatic handgun when he and a co-conspirator entered the Al Mini Mart in Valley Stream. Jackson held the store's employees at gunpoint while his partner attempted to remove money from the cash register.
Jackson shot Lopez after the clerk grabbed a bottle and attempted to resist the robbery. Jackson shot Lopez several more times after he followed him out of the store, prosecutors said.
Jackson apologized to the two dozen Lopez relatives who attended Monday's hearing for the pain he caused them. Some of the family members wore T-shirts and sweatshirts with a picture of Lopez. Many sobbed and cried throughout the hearing.
"There are no words to describe the anger and the pain I have felt since my father's death," said Lopez's daughter, Yisel, 18, of Oceanside. She described her father as a compassionate and kind man who worked hard to provide for his family.
Jackson's parents and siblings also attended the hearing and declined to comment after the sentencing but they were visibly angered. "That sentence is ridiculous!" one woman shouted after she left the courtroom.
"The sentence is extremely harsh," said Jackson's attorney, Garnett Sullivan of South Hempstead, who had asked Feuerstein to sentence Jackson to 17 years in prison.
Yisel Lopez said the sentence has not eased the pain of losing her father.
"They say time heals everything, but it doesn't," she said. "It just gets harder and harder."
Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District, said he hopes Jackson's sentence serves as an example.
"Jackson senselessly murdered a hardworking man who was just trying to support his wife and teenage daughter," Donoghue said. "While this sentence cannot return Mr. Lopez to his family and community, it will ensure that others will be protected from Jackson for decades to come and it will make other criminals think twice before taking a life," Donoghue sai

What we know, don't know about the Southern State bus crash: Several people on the bus were from Huntington High School, officials said

Abstract: None available.

Full text: What we know
- A bus carrying 38 high school students and five chaperones crashed into a Southern State Parkway overpass shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday.
- Most people on the bus were from Huntington High School, officials said.
- The top of the bus hit the Exit 18 overpass at Eagle Avenue in Lakeview as it traveled east.
- Two people - 17-year-old women - were seriously injured, five others had moderate injuries and three dozen had minor injuries, State Police said.
- The students were traveling from Kennedy Airport after a spring break trip to Europe with EF Tours and were headed to the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station to meet their parents.
- Troy D. Gaston, of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was identified as the bus driver. Gaston "obviously wasn't aware of the parkway system" and its restrictions on commercial vehicles, State Police Maj. David Candelaria said Sunday night.
- Gaston was using "a noncommercial vehicle GPS device," police said. The GPS indicated he took the Belt Parkway to the Southern State, Candelaria said. Investigators "still need to verify the actual route through a forensic analysis of the device and passenger interviews," police said in a news release.
- The driver had no trace of alcohol in his blood and testing was underway for drugs, Candelaria said. No charges have been filed.
- The bus was from Irvington, New Jersey-based Journey Bus Lines.
- The bus company has a safety rating of "satisfactory," and has not had any crashes in the past 24 months, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
- The National Transportation Safety Board has been notified of the crash but won't conduct an investigation, a spokesman said.
- The Eagle Avenue overpass has a clearance between 7 feet, 7 inches and 10 feet, according to signs on the overpass and eastbound Southern State. That's among the lowest on the Southern State, police said.
- The height of the bus is about 12 feet, according to the bus manufacturer.
- The students range in age from 16 to 18 and attend various high schools.
- Patients were taken to South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside and Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow. The injuries included one student with a neck-spine injury. Other injuries included broken bones, scrapes, bumps, and bruises, the hospitals said.
- The driver was among 21 patients taken to Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow in "noncritical condition," NUMC president and CEO Dr. Victor Politi said Monday morning.
What we don't know
Why the driver was using a noncommercial GPS or whether he had been trained to use a GPS system that warns truckers away from routes with low overpasses.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mike Handal was well aware of the history at play - nine losses in the previous 13 meetings.
And when given an opportunity to grab some bragging rights, he delivered with the go-ahead RBI in the bottom of the eighth inning.
"It was definitely in the back of our minds going into the later innings," the Garden City outfielder said of the Nassau All-Star seniors' mindset following a 5-4 victory over Suffolk in the 14th Rawlings Blue Chip Grand Slam Challenge at St. Joseph's (L.I.) on Friday night. "We were hungry for this."
Proceeds from the matchup benefitted North Shore LIJ's Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park.
Handal's single to rightfield broke a tie at 3 and put Nassau ahead 4-3. A throwing error later in the sequence extended the lead to two.
Handal was named the Nassau MVP with two RBIs, and West Islip outfielder Jake Guercio was named both the offensive and Suffolk MVP. Oceanside catcher Dylan Judd earned defensive player of the game honors.
St. Anthony's pitcher Jared Restmeyer's scoreless eighth earned him the win, and Locust Valley's Thomas Eletto forced a groundout with two runners on after surrendering a run to earn the save.
Plainedge's Jason Bottari scored the tying run for Nassau in the sixth on an RBI by Handal to even the score at 3. A run-scoring double-play groundout gave Suffolk a 3-2 lead in the fourth after back-to-back sacrifice flies by Port Washington's Jack Stolper and Bottari tied it at 2 in the third.
Guercio scored his second run of the night in the third on a wild pitch to give Suffolk an early 2-0 advantage. He finished 2-for-2 with a stolen base and made an acrobatic diving catch near the leftfield wall in the first that got the crowd buzzing.
"It's an honor to come down here," MacArthur assistant coach Steve Cashman said. "I think the best part of it is that all these guys have one moment together at the end to end their high school careers and be on the same field one last time together."
Copiague pitcher Franklin Parra, who was originally slated to start for Suffolk, sat out after being selected by the Mets in the 11th round of the MLB first-year player draft on Wednesday. He said he'll wait "until after graduation" to decide whether he will sign with the organization or commit to play college ball at San Jacinto College.
Catcher Logan O'Hoppe of St. John the Baptist was also in attendance following his 23rd-round selection by the Phillies. O'Hoppe confirmed his decision to sign with Philadelphia and said the two sides would meet to discuss contract terms during the weekend.

LETTERS Efforts to shore up Long Beach

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I was very interested to read about the progress in Long Beach to protect the beach with jetties, dunes, sand replenishment and sea walls along the boardwalk .
However, as long as the inlets act as expressways that can bring tidal surges into the back bays, all the communities on the bays of the South Shore remain sitting ducks in the face of a hurricane.
In 2016, I attended a presentation by the Army Corps of Engineers about this topic, and retractable flood gates at the inlets were discussed. I have heard nothing on the topic since. While the improvements at the beach are important, they represent no more than a piece of chewing gum in a leaking dam as long as there is no complementary program to install retractable tidal flood gates at the South Shore inlets.
Let's not wait for the next big one to hit to learn the hard way that the inlets must be addressed. There are many examples around the globe where this type of system has worked. As we approach the sixth anniversary of superstorm Sandy, we already should have progressed on this critical capital project that would save tens of billions of dollars in the event that another Sandy-type storm hits us.
Ray Xerri,Oceanside
The story on the Long Beach project reminded me of dunes perhaps 60 feet high on Fire Island that ran parallel to the ocean on both sides of Moriches Inlet in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, I can stand at Moriches Bay in Mastic Beach, look across to Fire Island and see the ocean. Those dunes? All gone, never to be seen again.
So with the first major hurricane or winter storm, much of those seven miles of sand that are being pumped onto Long Beach Island at a cost of $230 million will get washed back into the ocean, leaving the beach just as before.

LI schools to skip Model Congress event in New Rochelle: High school in Westchester urges six on Long Island to reconsider decision to stay away after spate of violence at and near its building

Abstract: None available.

Full text: ALBANY - A Westchester school is imploring six high schools on Long Island to abandon their plans to skip a Model Congress event for students in New Rochelle out of fear stemming from a recent classroom stabbing.
New Rochelle High School Principal Reginald Richardson said an official at George W. Hewlett High School in Hewlett told him his students won't participate in the March 23-24 event that culminates a year of debate at each of more than a dozen schools in the region. Richardson said he contacted the Wantagh, Seaford, Oceanside, Long Beach and Lawrence high schools, and officials confirmed they also wouldn't attend.
A letter to parents of Model Congress students from Hewlett High, confirmed by New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson, states: "The safety of our students and staff is our highest priority and there is too much uncertainty at this time."
None of the Long Island school districts responded to requests for comment Friday.
At issue is a classroom stabbing last month. A suspect, a student, remained at large Friday. Days before, two other attacks in the neighborhood on students - one fatal - prompted police to bolster security at the New Rochelle school.
"Over the past few months, New Rochelle has been painted with a broad brush," states a letter by Model Congress students on the New Rochelle website addressed to the Long Island schools.
"Please do not let the acts of a handful of children, none of whom are involved with Model Congress, determine the reputation of a school that has over 3500 students," the letter states. "Please do not deduce that New Rochelle, our home, is a dangerous place, simply because that is how it has been portrayed by the media. Finally, please permit your students to attend New Rochelle Model Congress this year."
The students have invited the Long Island schools to a tour and discussion before the event.
"The whole point of the Model Congress is to hear the opinions of other people and form well-founded opinions about things," said Julia Middlesworth, 17, a senior at New Rochelle.

Groups protest Planned Parenthood's federal funding

Author: Blasey, Laura

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]12 Feb 2017.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867271285?accountid=37869

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Signs held high, demonstrators who want to see Planned Parenthood lose its federal funding gathered outside the organization's clinics across the country Saturday, including three on Long Island.
Small groups of demonstrators gathered outside clinics in Hempstead, Smithtown and Patchogue for about an hour and a half. In Hempstead, 10 people stood on the sidewalk with signs condemning the organization for its abortion services. Some prayed, as Planned Parenthood volunteers stood by, ready to escort patients.
The protests were part of a national campaign by #ProtestPP, a coalition of abortion opponents aiming to halt Planned Parenthood's federal support.
However, in some cities, counter-protests dwarfed abortion foes' demonstrations.
Thousands of Planned Parenthood supporters, many wearing the pointy-eared pink hats popularized by last month's women's marches, rallied in St. Paul, Minnesota, separated by barricades from an anti-abortion crowd of a couple hundred people. In Detroit, about 300 people turned up outside a Planned Parenthood office, most of them supporting the organization. In St. Louis, about 150 abortion opponents slightly outnumbered a group carrying pink signs that read, "I stand with Planned Parenthood."
In one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump last month banned U.S. funding to international groups that perform abortions or even provide information about abortions. Vice President Mike Pence strongly opposes abortion, and the newly confirmed health secretary, Tom Price, has supported cutting off taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood has long faced scrutiny for offering abortions, although the procedure constitutes about 3 percent of the services it provided nationally in 2014, according to the organization. The majority of women seek out contraception, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, or other services including cancer screenings, at Planned Parenthood clinics.
The organization receives about $500 million annually through Medicaid and Title X funding, though federal regulations prevent that funding from being used for abortions.
"While everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, they are not entitled to their own facts," said JoAnn Smith, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County. "The facts are very simple: There is no federal funding for abortions, and defunding Planned Parenthood from Medicaid reimbursements would result in a public health crisis."
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says defunding plans would cut roughly $400 million in Medicaid money from the group in the year after enactment and would result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care. Republicans would redirect the funding to community health centers, but Planned Parenthood supporters say women denied Medicaid services from Planned Parenthood may not be able to find replacement care.
But Patchogue organizer Barbara Renna, 66, said she believes Planned Parenthood doesn't have women's best interests in mind. She demonstrated Saturday with about 10 other abortion opponents and said she would rather see federal funds go to other organizations.
Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, which oversees the organization's locations in Suffolk County, did not return a call seeking comment.

Release federal funds for MTA, LIRR rail safety, Schumer says: $5.2M would also improve Metro-North crossings Money was awarded in September, senator says

Abstract: In a letter to Federal Railroad Administration Acting Administrator Patrick Warren, Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged the agency to "swiftly obligate" $5.2 million in Railroad Safety Infrastructure Improvement Grant funding that was awarded to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in September.

Full text: Sen. Chuck Schumer is urging federal transportation officials to expedite the release of more than $5 million in promised grant funding to the MTA that it needs to improve safety at several railroad grade crossings, including on the Long Island Rail Road.
In a letter to Federal Railroad Administration Acting Administrator Patrick Warren, Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged the agency to "swiftly obligate" $5.2 million in Railroad Safety Infrastructure Improvement Grant funding that was awarded to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in September. Schumer said the New York State Department of Transportation still has not received any of the money and "negotiations are ongoing on specific grant agreements."
"These funds are urgently needed to upgrade dangerous grade crossings and reduce the number of accidents, and therefore I'd urge you to expedite the approval of the grant agreements and award the funds as quickly as possible," Schumer wrote.
FRA spokeswoman Desiree French said Thursday that the federal agency and the state DOT "are working closely together to finalize the required documentation for the three grant agreements. We expect the funds to be obligated by the end of April."
MTA officials have said the funding would pay for cameras at 43 LIRR and Metro-North crossings to investigate accidents and analyze operations; new traffic control devices at crossings in Deer Park and Oceanside; and more and better signs and pavement markings at many other crossings.
The MTA stepped up safety protocols at its crossings - including nearly 300 along the LIRR's tracks - after a Feb. 3, 2015, accident at a Valhalla crossing in Westchester County that killed a motorist and five train passengers.

NYPD officer Kenneth Healy, injured in hatchet attack, promoted to detective

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The NYPD officer who was seriously injured in an attack by a hatchet-wielding man in October 2014 was promoted to detective Friday in a ceremony at police headquarters in Manhattan.
For Kenneth Healey, 28, who lives in Oceanside, his bump in rank is a dream come true. His father is a retired Nassau County police detective.
"It means a lot to me," Healey said before the ceremony, during which 151 NYPD officers received promotions. "Before I came on the job it was my goal to become a detective or sergeant."
That goal was put in serious jeopardy when a disturbed man pulled a hatchet out of his backpack and attacked Healey on a street in Jamaica, Queens. Healey was struck in the back of the head as he stood with two other cops, who shot and killed the attacker.
Healey was hospitalized and had to go through more than a year of grueling rehabilitation, during which he feared he might not return to work.
"When it first happened, I couldn't feel the left side of my body at all. I couldn't see on my left side. I couldn't walk. I couldn't dress myself. I couldn't tie my shoes," Healey recalled. "To get back to work was the main goal."
Healey, whose brother John became an NYPD officer in 2015, received the department's Medal of Honor in June 2016. He is now assigned to Queens North and is expected to remain there. His new rank will be detective investigator.
At the ceremony, Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill gave a special shout-out to Healey, saying he was attacked because he was a cop.
O'Neill also made special mention of audience member Lisa Tuozzolo, the widow of NYPD Sgt. Paul Tuozzolo of Huntington, who was killed in action last year.

Nathan's Famous revenue edges up, earnings fall

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nathan's Famous Inc., the Jericho restaurant operator and hot dog maker, Friday reported that first quarter revenue edged higher, but net income fell 17.7 percent due in part to more favorable tax benefits in the year-earlier period.
Revenue was $30.9 million compared to $29.4 million in the quarter ended June 26, 2016. Net income for the most recent quarter was $2.9 million, or 69 cents per diluted share, versus $3.6 million, or 85 cents per diluted share.
In its report before Friday's market open, the company said that tax benefits of $78,000 increased earnings per share by 2 cents in the recent quarter, compared to benefits of $621,000, which increased earnings per share by 15 cents in the prior year's period.
Nathan's said foul weather, especially at its two Coney Island locations, affected sales at company operated restaurants, which posted revenue of $4.4 million compared to $4.8 million in the 2016 quarter.
Shares of Nathan's fell 10 cents to close at $60.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Nathan's shares have risen about 25 percent in the past 12 months.

Full text:   Hundreds of Long Island students recently went head-to-head on a different kind of playing field: the magnetic field.
Great Neck South Middle School won six of the 21 trophies - the most of any school - in Brookhaven National Laboratory's 26th annual Middle School Maglev Contest, which challenged students to race vehicles that use magnetic force to levitate and propel them over a track. This year, more than 140 students competed from nine local middle schools.
In a similar competition held simultaneously at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, Levittown's Jonas E. Salk Middle School and Lawrence Woodmere Academy each won four awards - the most of any school. That event attracted roughly 115 students from five middle schools.
"We have a solid young team. I was so proud," Great Neck coach Randy Lane said. "One of the most important things they learned is problem-solving."
Participants built maglev, short for "magnetic levitation," vehicles according to specifications, in categories ranging from electrified track to gravity to wind power. Judging was based on speed, efficiency, appearance and written design.
In the lab's contest, Center Moriches Middle School and Robert Moses Middle School in North Babylon tied for second with four awards. In the museum's contest, Westbury Middle School earned two awards.
HAUPPAUGE
Rescue dogs
Hauppauge Middle School's Pause 4 Paws Puppy Club is sponsoring dogs through the nonprofit New York State Retriever Rescue and making posters for display in the community to help find homes for their furry friends.
The club also will hold a donation drive and sell dog biscuits for the rescue group, school officials said.
To kick off the effort, rescue volunteer Steve Lefkowitz visited the school with three dogs - Buddy, Max and Pickles - and spoke about the differences between animal shelters and rescue organizations, as well as the importance of spay/neuter programs.
"The students were excited to learn that they can help homeless pets," said Jennifer Shapiro, the club's adviser.
COUNTYWIDE
Odyssey of the Mind
Five teams from Suffolk County competed this month in the state finals of Odyssey of the Mind in Binghamton after placing among the top two spots in various categories of the Long Island regional.
The competition challenges students to explore creative problem-solving methods that range from building mechanical devices to presenting their own interpretation of literary classics.
Suffolk teams vying at the state level were Westhampton Beach Elementary School (Team No. 25914) and Our Lady of Wisdom Regional School in Port Jefferson (Team No. 30390).
None of the teams advanced to the national level in Iowa.
ISLANDWIDE
NYS Science Fair
Sixteen Long Island students won placement to become finalists for the Intel International Science & Engineering Fair after participating in the New York State Science & Engineering Fair, held last month at the New York Hall of Science in Queens.
The international fair, to be held May 8-13 in Phoenix, will include 1,700-plus pupils from more than 75 countries vying for $4 million in prizes.
The students are: Ray Janis and Kyle Mitra, Commack High School; Moges Selamit, Elmont Memorial High School; Karena Etwaru and Cassandra Grello, Half Hollow Hills High School East; Alec Fischthal, Remi Golden, Chenab Khakh, Matthew Perkins and Ariel Slepyan, all of Hewlett High School; Rishi Shah and Aaron Wang, Jericho High School; Steven Picillo, Oceanside High School; Allegra Noto, Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington; Jordyn Schor, Plainview-Old Bethpage JFK High School; and Sarah Lee, Syosset High School.

Nassau PAL program helps anglers with special needs enjoy the outdoors

Author: Schlichter, Tom

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]15 July 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1803998433?accountid=37869

Abstract: Wednesday evening the shop hosted its Third Annual Nassau County Police Athletic League Special Needs Unit (PAL-SNU) Fishing Trip.

Full text:   Capt. Ed Walsh broke out a big grin and waved to a family of would-be anglers cutting across the parking lot at Jones Beach Field 10.
"Ready to give this a try? "he asked to the approval of nodding heads and nervous chuckles. "There's free bait, rods, chum and crab traps on the docks right behind the shop - plus some expert fishermen out there to give you a hand."
Walsh, a retired NYC firefighter, runs the Jones Beach Fishing Station (631-559-5938.) Wednesday evening the shop hosted its Third Annual Nassau County Police Athletic League Special Needs Unit (PAL-SNU) Fishing Trip.
"It's a way for us to give back to the community," he said while overseeing a dozen volunteer master anglers who frequent the docks here work to quickly get everyone's line in the water. "We draw about 40 participants for this event, which includes special needs kids and adults, plus their family chaperones or aids. The idea is to get everyone outdoors, maybe catch a few fish or crabs, and break free of daily routines.
Which is exactly where things seemed headed at the 5 p.m. starting time. Leaning comfortably against the west pier rail, Chris Sciarratta and his 13-year old son, Christopher, were fishing with each other for the first time. The younger Sciarratta has previously attended PAL-SNU (516-241-3197) programs for football and bowling. This, said his dad, was an opportunity to try something new while spending time together. It wasn't long before the Oceanside Middle School student discovered he had a penchant for catching green crabs with both fishing lines and box traps.
Nearby, Michaela Roper of Elmont, a community habilitation worker, was enjoying time with ten-year old Ben Davis from Williston Park.
"This is cool," said Ben enthusiastically while examining a large calico crab. "I would do this every day!"
So, apparently, would Roper. "What an amazing program; so simple and fun," she said. "It gets everyone out to mingle and socialize while the fishing teaches patience. These are important points for many people here to work on. Ben and I have done basketball, soccer and horseback riding with the Nassau County PAL-SNU. We did the fishing program last year, too. There was only one sea robin caught but we still couldn't wait to come back."
The fun and learning would continue on this humid evening - and the catches would be greatly improved.
"She has a monster!" came a shout from the east dock as a crowd gathered to cheer Natasha Greenbaum, 17, in her battle with a huge porgy weighing nearly 3 pounds.
"It fought hard," she said with a smile that seemed to span Jones Inlet while Walsh helped her steady the beast for photos. "That's the biggest fish I've ever caught!"
A few minutes later, a second large porgy, this one on the west dock, came over the rail. In between, anglers caught sea robins, green crabs and calico crabs. Aside from the porgies everything was released, usually with the aid of 14-year-old Daniel Caminiti of Levittown, the youngest of the shop's volunteer crew.
"This is a great day," said Roper as the sun began to slide below the horizon, "and programs like this one really make a difference in people's lives. We need more good stuff like this in the world today."

American Family Care plans 6 urgent care centers for LI

Author: Schachter, Ken

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]16 Sep 2016.

Abstract: Two Hofstra University graduates, Lou Dionisio, 58, and Justin Schwartz, 38, are AFC's franchisees for Long Island and managing partners of the center, which has seven exam rooms, two triage rooms, a procedure room and digital X-ray services.

Full text:   American Family Care, a 34-year-old Birmingham, Alabama, company that expects to have more than 200 clinics in 26 states by year's end, is opening its first urgent care center on Long Island, with plans afoot to open five more within three years.
The 4,000-square-foot AFC Urgent Care center on Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow is staging its grand opening Thursday.
Two Hofstra University graduates, Lou Dionisio, 58, and Justin Schwartz, 38, are AFC's franchisees for Long Island and managing partners of the center, which has seven exam rooms, two triage rooms, a procedure room and digital X-ray services.
Dionisio said Thursday that he and Schwartz already have earmarked locations in Oceanside and Commack, with the other three locations to be determined.
Urgent care centers, which allow patients to walk in and be treated for illnesses and injuries without waiting for an appointment, are sprouting up on Long Island. The Urgent Care Association of America, an industry trade group, estimates there are more than 100 in Nassau and Suffolk counties.
Among the entrants in the Long Island market are Atlanta-based GoHealth Urgent Care, Lake Success-based ProHealth Urgent Care and Manhattan-based CityMD.
Dionisio put the cost of opening the East Meadow center at between $1 million and $1.5 million and said that after the five additional franchises are in place, he and Schwartz could tap capital from an investment group to "roll it out a little faster."
AFC is opening urgent care centers nationwide at a rate of one a week, he said, and projections call for the number of urgent care centers from all providers to more than double from the current 9,000 to 20,000 in the next five years.
"There are more urgent care centers in America than Burger Kings," he said.
The East Meadow center is staging a community event on Saturday including face painting, prizes and an appearance by Herb Williams, former head coach of the New York Knicks and current assistant coach of the New York Liberty.

Island Park's Barnum Bridge to have limited closures in fall

Author: Cassese, Sid

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]22 Mar 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774722185?accountid=37869

Abstract: Mary Studdert, spokeswoman for the Nassau Department of Public Works, said the county had been considering repairs for nearly five years and put weight restrictions on the bridge in 2011.

Full text:   Reactions were varied to news that traffic between Oceanside and Island Park will be strained this fall because of major Nassau County repair work on the Barnum Island Bridge that connects the two communities.
Nassau put out a request for proposals for the work last month, and the deadline to respond is 3 p.m. Thursday. The request estimates the construction costs at $8.3 million.
Mary Studdert, spokeswoman for the Nassau Department of Public Works, said the county had been considering repairs for nearly five years and put weight restrictions on the bridge in 2011.
The county has received the necessary funding from the federal government, nearly $8 million, she said. She said she expected work to begin in early fall and to last about 18 months.
The bridge is, in fact, two spans, northbound and southbound. Studdert said one span will be demolished and reconstructed at a time. The northbound span was built in 1925; the southbound in 1961.
"Traffic will be moved to the other bridge, with two lanes in each direction re-striped using the shoulder area," Studdert said.
Butch Yamali, the owner of Peter's Clam Bar in Island Park, not far from the bridge, is unhappy about the work. He said he is disappointed that the county would contemplate making these repairs without discussing it with local businesses and residents.
"This is especially true with so many of us in the business community still recovering from superstorm Sandy," he said.
He added that he would go to county Legis. Denise Ford (R-Long Beach), to discuss the expected impact of the work on his business.
In an interview, Ford said: "This is a much-needed work, and we will try to work with all parties to minimize any negative impact. I'm going to ask the public for patience. . . . If we don't use this funding now, it may be 10 years before we're offered it again. There's no telling what condition the bridge will be in at that time."
Howard Cohen, the owner of Shane's Dollar Daze, a store in a small shopping center down the street from Yamali's restaurant, said he did not think the work would be a major problem.
"It will slow down traffic, but people will get used to it," he said.
Steve Jordan, of Jordan Lobster Farms, another seafood restaurant in Island Park, said: "There's no doubt that it will slow traffic down and hurt business. Rather than go through gridlock, people will just stay at home or go somewhere a lot closer."
Ken Reiner, 64, of Long Beach said he uses the bridge to travel to Lynbrook. "So whether I keep going that way or I take the Atlantic Beach Bridge, I can expect to add 10 to 15 minutes to my trip," he said.

Bernie Sanders speaks at iconic Coney Island boardwalk

Author: Ngo, Emily

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]11 Apr 2016.

Abstract: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders stumped Sunday before thousands of supporters against the backdrop of Brooklyn's iconic Coney Island boardwalk, a symbol of resilience after superstorm Sandy.

Full text:   Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders stumped Sunday before thousands of supporters against the backdrop of Brooklyn's iconic Coney Island boardwalk, a symbol of resilience after superstorm Sandy.
The U.S. senator from Vermont - trailing rival Hillary Clinton by double digits in recent polls of New York voters - touched on themes familiar to his staunchest supporters.
He railed against the country's wealthiest residents and said expanded Social Security benefits and pay parity between men and women could help improve the economic realities of the working class.
He spoke to sustained cheers from the crowd of mostly young people who braved the oceanside chill and hourslong wait to see him.
Sanders made only passing references to New York, which holds its primary April 19.
He congratulated the state for enacting a $15 minimum wage.
And the Flatbush, Brooklyn, native reminisced about swimming at Coney Island beaches as a youth and joked that he has "eaten half the hot dogs that Nathan's produced." After the rally, he stopped by the mainstay eatery for a wiener with sauerkraut.
Otherwise, his speech - lasting nearly an hour - centered on combating income inequality.
"A great nation is judged by how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable people among us," he said.
His backers listened raptly in the shadow of the Parachute Jump, a former amusement park ride that still stands along the boardwalk, waving signs that read "A Future to Believe In."
It was the seventh public event in the city for Sanders in the past three days. On Monday, he will campaign in central New York, making four stops at cities with college campuses.
Vlady Kozubnyak, 20, a college student from Coney Island, praised the senator's consistency on issues over the decades, citing Sanders' arrest in the 1960s at a civil rights demonstration protesting segregation in Chicago schools.
"He's been steady the whole time," Kozubnyak said. "He's been a protester the whole time."
But Kozubnyak said he is concerned about the delegate math, which favors Clinton, and was bracing for a loss.
Sanders slammed Clinton for raising funds from political action committees and delivering big-dollar speeches on Wall Street.
The former secretary of state, who spoke at a Queens church Sunday, has said those speeches would have no impact on how she would conduct herself as president and that it was common practice for high-profile officials to get paid for speeches.

Appeals court reverses last open 'Flush the Johns' case

Author: Murphy, William

Publication info: Newsday , Combined editions; Long Island, N.Y. [Long Island, N.Y]12 Apr 2016.

https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780097107?accountid=37869

Abstract: Judge Sharon Gianelli, now a Supreme Court justice, had ruled that prosecutors had not elicited testimony from the undercover officer who got a telephone call from Frankel in which they arranged to meet in a hotel room on April 26, 2013.

Full text:   An Oceanside man accused of patronizing a prostitute has lost his bid to have the charges dismissed on grounds that police lacked probable cause to arrest him and improperly seized the $100 he allegedly placed on a hotel room dresser.
An appeals court ruled last week that a District Court judge in Hempstead had erred when she suppressed the $100 as evidence. The Appellate Term, which reviews misdemeanors, returned the case of Scott Frankel to the lower Hempstead court for further proceedings.
Frankel, 50, was among 104 men arrested in April and May of 2013 in a Nassau anti-prostitution sting dubbed "Flush the Johns." His is the only remaining open case, the Nassau district attorney's office confirmed Monday. He did not return telephone calls for comment.
Judge Sharon Gianelli, now a Supreme Court justice, had ruled that prosecutors had not elicited testimony from the undercover officer who got a telephone call from Frankel in which they arranged to meet in a hotel room on April 26, 2013.
Absent that testimony, Gianelli ruled, prosecutors had failed to establish that the $100 was in return for sex, and police did not have probable cause to arrest Frankel.
The appeals court disagreed, ruling that the testimony of another officer who overheard the call was sufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest.
Frankel had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a hotel room that he did not rent, so the seizure of the $100 was not improper, the appeals court added.
In June 2013, then-Nassau District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced the results of the sting and insisted there would be no plea bargains. All the defendants would have to plead guilty to patronizing a prostitute in the third degree, a misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to 1 year in jail, she said.
Several defense attorneys said Rice's position prompted their clients to mount protracted pretrial challenges in an attempt to avoid having a criminal record, and six of the seven cases that went to trial resulted in acquittals. More than 80 men eventually pleaded guilty to either the misdmeanor patronizing charge or disorderly conduct, a violation.
A year later, on June 3, 2014, Rice revealed that she had changed her policy. The men would be allowed to plead to a reduced charge that would leave them without a criminal record if they took an awareness class on prostitution.
A total of 67 men took the reduced plea, a spokesman said Monday.
The one man convicted at trial was later allowed to take the reduced plea.

Abstract: Kimmel jumped Elardo's slant route for an interception in the second quarter, but it was his pick in the end zone late in the fourth quarter that put an emphatic stamp on the fifth-seeded Chiefs' 35-16 win over No. 4 Syosset in Nassau I. Kimmel returned his second interception 61 yards to set up Chris Bacotti's 39-yard rushing TD on Massapequa's next play for the game's final score.

Full text:   A true challenge, a test of his A-game, requiring all of his football smarts ... Massapequa cornerback Casey Kimmel's assignment this week was all of the above. But the senior welcomed the task of defending Syosset receiver Michael Elardo - who set a Long Island record last season for receiving yards and was arguably Nassau's best receiver again this year - with open arms.
"Everyone knows him. He's a good receiver," Kimmel said. "I just wanted to make a name for myself and our team."
Kimmel jumped Elardo's slant route for an interception in the second quarter, but it was his pick in the end zone late in the fourth quarter that put an emphatic stamp on the fifth-seeded Chiefs' 35-16 win over No. 4 Syosset in Nassau I.
Kimmel returned his second interception 61 yards to set up Chris Bacotti's 39-yard rushing TD on Massapequa's next play for the game's final score.
"He was the go-to guy," coach Kevin Shippos said of Kimmel.
The drama for this clash was set seven weeks ago, when Cameron Biegel's 24-yard FG gave Syosset a thrilling 40-39 win over the Chiefs in Week 2.
"We lost by 1 on our home field. Nothing worse than that," Massapequa quarterback Justin Lynskey said. "When they kicked that field goal, they all came on the field, started celebrating, that was a terrible feeling. We kept it in the back of our minds all week."
The defense played like that game was burned into its memory. Massapequa made three interceptions - Kimmel's two and one by Chris Wasson in the game's waning moments. The defensive line brought its best - "unbelievable," "tremendous" and "best game they've played this year" is how Shippos described the effort - and racked up nine sacks. John Cardis, James Magaldi and Frank Callan each had two. Anthony White forced a fumble and recovered it.
In the first half, Massapequa (5-4) built a 21-3 lead thanks to a 1-yard touchdown run by Lynskey and touchdown runs of 10 and 14 yards by Tommy Macri. It was the same play each time: Macri started on the right, motioned left, got the handoff and swept left for the TD.
Syosset (5-4) scored on its first two possessions of the third quarter: Will Hogan to Robert Santiago for a 39-yard TD, and Biegel to Hogan (after he lateraled to Biegel) for a thrilling 95-yard score.
But Lynskey barreled in a score from 8 yards out on Massapequa's next possession to make it 28-16, and the defense did the rest.
Massapequa will play No. 1 Oceanside on Saturday at Hofstra.
"Playing football at Hofstra, there's nothing like it," Lynskey said. "I'm pumped."
